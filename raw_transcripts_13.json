  "transcript": "and there is Nick Falls the Eagle fans at attendance here let out a big cheer when he hit the field as we welcome you to FedEx Field and the NFL on Fox the wrapup to the regular season with Darrell Johnston a threetime Super Bowl champ chris fires an early happy new year thanks a lot for being with us well for the Eagles to get back in all they gotta do is win and hope that the Vikings lose we'll be keeping an eye on that throughout the game they've won four of their last five it's in the hands of Nick Foles their Super Bowl MVP and Doug Peterson saying last night our team was right where we want to be and it may be in the nick of time they're playing their best football at the best time of year and this is a team that was going to face all the normal challenges you do as a defending Super Bowl champion then they get hit by the injury bug they sit at four and six after being embarrassed by the New Orleans Saints and they're able to turn it around one thing Chris Long wanted to make sure everybody knew they never quit and if you're in the NFC right now this is a team you do not want to get into the playoffs well after weeks and the rich gets at a six and three record they led the NFC East division by two games outlets Smith gets hurt four quarterbacks play over the next four games and it's interesting Darrell just one win separates Philadelphia and Washington yet it feels like a million miles apart it's amazing that only one separates the one win separates these teams when you sit down and talk to and see the different vibe the different emotions you mentioned the four quarterback but 24 players put on IR your margin for error is so small from week to week it makes it so challenging Ryan Kerrigan told us they've got the right guys here good intensity good effort to practice during the course of the week we'll see how that translate to the field today Washington trying to finish with an eight and eight record let's head down to the field of lore open Pearson's message this week we can't be watching any other game because if we lose this game we're done the scoreboard I'm filly side will be showing the Bears Vikings game but will they be watching Chris long told me listen it's not like we're not going to try to break our necks trying not to look but I think the moment we start thinking about things we can't control the things we can't control start to unravel our focus is here thank you very much and here we go temperature of the 40's light wind no rain in the forecast Byron Marshall for the Redskins on the return he slips through a tackle him brought down short of the 25 the Redskins did win the toss and they wanted the football and they have it we mentioned the quarterback shuffle Josh Johnson is bounced around but since stepping in for the Redskins number he was signed after Colt McCoy who played in relief of the injury to starter Alex Smith and he was able to grab a win for this team his mobility could be a factor today in fact mobile quarterbacks have given the Eagle defense a bit of a problem yeah but that's going to be key for this Redskin offense that offensive line one of the areas that was hit really really hard with that injury bug so the ability to extend plays and get out of the pocket will be key to them having success this afternoon Johnson scrambling right away pointing throwing it open but the other throw that it's intercepted Rasul Douglas with the takeaway and that's been a big difference for the Eagles now in their last five plus games eleven takeaways compared to just six in their first 11 games really well played right here just kind of in that trail position looking back finding the quarterback seen what's going on he looks open but that's a long throw and the ability to close and make the interception by Rasul Douglas and you saw Douglas with a little talk of the jersey on Josh dachshund he was open it just took a while for the ball to get there and the takeaway sets up the Eagles and they wear that as if they're stealing the football from the opposition looks like my agent but it's a it's a difference maker Doug Peters has said not only is the defensive line played well our takeaways have made a difference shortening the field for our offense and here on the first play they get it back for Falls who gives to Wendell Smallwood with a gain of eight on first down Falls making his fifth start of this season three in one record he opens the season Carson Wentz is inactive Nate son felt would be the backup here and what a game fact he said for 400 yard passing games a recordsetting moment when you look at Eagle quarterbacks over time as Darren Sproles checks in on second and 2 straightahead scrolls he's got a first down up across the 41yard line offensive line Jason Peters battling that quad injury but he's toughing it out Lane Johnson no sacks allowed last week by him against the tough JJ Watt good performance there by that offensive line and then the skill positions have gotten healthy they were really injured in that wide receiver running back area early in the season working with a personnel group three tight ends that that is something that used from time to time but it became the feature personnel group and that's not who this team is redskins with a deep drop there's a flag neutral home infraction defense number 94 fiveyard penalty first down Preston Smith caught leaning in there Craig Ralston our referee today and that'll make things easier what's the biggest difference with Falls in this lineup versus Carson Wentz I think one of the things that we learned yesterday his read and react response to what the offensive play in the matchups are he gives his guys opportunities with 50/50 balls down the field a lot of people talk about a more vertical approach but it's the match FCC's at three stem good rush he had to get rid of it over the head of Sproles Preston Smith was the guy coming in on then Washington defense without Matt ioan itis Caleb Brantley starts up front in place of him Carrigan going to the Pro Bowl after a slow start a dozen sacks for Washington and DeShazer Everett in the secondary for the since release DJ Swearengen and this group a lot of people asking white Greg Monette skis defense hasn't been able to to carry this team while they've been relatively healthy it's that complimentary football the offenses is not holding the ball that defense is on the field a lot not getting off on third down and first down it's Santa $40.00 got her gets down around 2:30 of Washington the emergent rookie tight end has allowed this offense to open up and that's just one of those other situations where now you've got another tight end coming in that Zach Ertz who draws all the coverage to you and now you've got Dallas guard or crossing the field underneath into the flat and his emergence now with that two tight end personnel something that Doug Peterson would like to get into more often with a healthy set of wide receivers and those running back back again at 25 yards Josh Adams is it at running but he gets the carry and gets inside the 25 of Washington before he gets jumped back Doug Peterson in his third year talked about the greatest challenge of repeating as a Super Bowl champion so the energy level from training camp all the way to where we are now it could SAP good he admitted himself many times I had to remind myself of that not just the team a lot of distractions in the offseason celebrating your Super Bowl championship but you got to get ready to defend and they found that to be a little bit challenging this offseason this will be on the Eagles it would appear false start offense number 71 and number 65 that's a flagrant penalty all right they got two eagles on that now Philadelphia they've scored the fewest first quarter points of any team in the NFL this year and 38 points that's somewhat surprising given this office but even false said I'm a rhythm guy I wanna I want to start get into a pattern get into a rhythm and has an opportunity here although the penalty backing them up yeah but better the last four games through the last four games they've scored by false a still completes the pass but just at that 25 yard line where Golden Tate called in the past the opening drive last week against Houston was outstanding 13 plays 77 yards and that's the kind of rhythm that Nick Foles is talking about you mentioned you know the fewest points in the first quarter and what is different about this team one of the things over the last month is their ability to start the game quickly and get some points on that opening drive holes hit on 15 of 16 passes on third or fourth down and previous week he's facing the third and five and it's intercepted into the arms of the Redskins DeShazer Everett with the pick they trade turnovers and a costly one there because the Eagles were in field goal range Foles intercepted by Everett and Washington is back on office Nick Foles looking for Zach Ertz on this play but look at the coverage it's tight it's really congested in the middle of the field and this ball sails on Nick Foles and this'll happen from time to time he had a bad interception in the second half of the game last week against the Houston Texans and not so much of the ball sailing but also the decisionmaking that happens from time to time with Nick Foles DeShazer Everett 24 yard interception return 31 yard a lot of Washington Adrian Peterson and a flag dropped at the 31 after Peterson cherry holding offense number 87 10yard penalty still first down Chris if there's one thing the Redskins have been good at this season its offensive holding unfortunately that's not a good thing to lead the league and they do lead the league in holding penalties apples on Jeremy sprinkles the reserve tight end Vernon Davis is out with a concussion Jordan Reed was put on injured reserve as the injuries continue to pile up on Jay Gruden wipes out a eight yard game now first it's Warnock Johnson's throw clock by Crowder up at the 28 yard line that's what I mean when I talk about margin for error second and two versus first and 20 that Redskins can't stay in those types of positions against this defense of the Philadelphia Eagles Jordan Hicks important part of that defense battling a calf strain but he is out there we've already seen one take away by this eagle defense in this game but the pass defense has been leaky can just shot to take advantage Johnson at second and 13 is going to have to run there's room if he wants to head on field he throws and the catch toward the sideline did he stay inbounds that's Michael Floyd and he's in the lineup because Maurice Harris was put on injured reserve out of bounds is the ruling on the reception let's check the feet and the officials gathered right again we've seen the ability of Josh Johnson to get out extend these plays and be mobile a little high right there able to get that first foot down but not able to get the second one in Redskins averaging just under 19 points a game facing a third and 13 need to get to the 41yard line for a first down it's a fourman rush the thrall is it completely let's get a game break say hi to charissa Thompson a Carissa hey Chris so as you know the Eagles clinched with the win and the Vikings lost I'll keep you updated on this game all day long try Biscay hands it off to Jordan Howard who scores from 6 yards out on the opening drive bears leading early 7nothing Chris Terrell and Maura thank you Carissa that's good news for Eagle fans who want the win here and at Minnesota loss to grab the final NFC playoff spot the Rams are leading against the 49ers by the score of 7 to nothing that figures of the big picture they can nail down the to see Sproles back at the 15yard line nick foles after throwing an early interception takes over with the Eagles on offense scoreless duck Peterson saying last night I have to write on my call sheet a reminder patience with the run and stare at it every once in a while everybody from the Andy Reid offense has to write patience with the run on their call sheet because they tend to slide 265 pass 35 run now in the beginning of the year when he had Jaya Jaya it was easy to do that you've got a big physical running back he wanted to have that style to this offense but he's had to adjust a little bit and he has to remind himself during the course of the game they've run it three times and thrown at four on first down it comes with a big hole who slips across the 20yard line philadelphia adams had a tough fumble last week but he has taken over because of the injuries at running back he's the Eagles leading rusher played 13 games after the first couple of weeks he was on the practice squad he'll be important if Philadelphia wins today in Chicago wins today and the Eagles get into the playoff Josh Adams is going to be important for this team because he does add that physical element in the running game that Det Doug Peterson can be patient he's six foot two that got averaging over four yards of carry the Bears are leading the Vikings seven to nothing Graham's our leading San Francisco seven of them scoreless here pulls has time but then he's brought down short of the 18 is Stacey McGee got to him nice job in the secondary by the Washington Redskins no where for Nick Foles to go with the football we talked about read and react he's going through his progression trying to find where the ball goes you can see him look to his left that was his outlet but it was too late as protection broke down Foles was excuse me scrolls was over there but folks couldn't get it to him quick enough after a loss of three Darren Sproles is the running back three receivers topping your screen Golden Tate in the slot Eagles need a polls has a moment and in between Tate couldn't hold it a couple of Redskin defenders look like falls it dropped it in there it really did I'll have to see what happens here with gold and Tate and he's got it right there he tries to kind of onehand it I don't know if he felt ha ha Clinton dicks coming up and was trying to prepare for a big hit but that was great location by Nick Foles full the taste she's got to finish that play Redskins defense forces a 4th down punt first to your putter from Ohio State Cameron Johnston from inside his own 10 and Crowder has it at the 36 Crowder cuts back and gets up across the 44 yard line a line on the line for the Eagles it's an oldfashioned NFC's rivalry game the redskins and philadelphia recap of the seven eight redskins seasoned veterans on offense the end and Alex Smith and Adrian Peterson get out to a 63 start led the division but that tenth game Smith the broken leg three different start at quarterback since going one on five and they release DJ Swearengen from the defense after he was critical of the defensive coordinator and some other moves but Jay Gruden said we had to talk about that more on that later I'm trying to keep the football team on the football stuff and finish at least with an 8 9 record making the stop is Brandon Graham on Adrian Peterson boy he's been flame well down the stretch you know all this team is they've gotten healthy and gotten everybody back in the lineup they're gonna have a tough decision on Brandon Graham at the end of this season a number of free agents on that Jim Schwartz defense Graham was one of those guys he said I can't I'm not gonna kid you here I'll be scoreboard watching when I'm not on the field playing and he's looking up at the bear is leading Minnesota seven to nothing after a loss of four johnson batted away and almost intercepted was almost another eagle takeaway Johnson already has one pick Rasul Douglas on that opening throw well you've got a banged up offensive line you've got a quarterback that's only been in your system for a little over a month right now and jim schwartz is bringing some fresh you're up inside trying to cloud that up nigel Bradham goes up and gets a deflection on that one we're at them last week played every snap on defense and that went over the Texas third and 14 by ego fans here got you too edge rushers on the same side Chris long with Michael Bennett trying to dump it off to Chris Thompson and its fourth down let's get a game break Carissa fix Chris to the Ravens to clinch the AFC North with a win Baker trying to play spoiler this helps finds brashaad Perriman for this 28 yards score rounds up early seven three Krista and lock all right thank you the scramble in the AFC the Chiefs are leading the Raiders seven to nothing they can nail down the number one seed the Patriots won earlier they have a chance of the 1 seed but at least the first round by for New England once again and Scrolls has it and knocked down right away up a 20 good special teams play as a Washington Redskins get it from Adonis Alexander Eagles on offense at a scoreless opening quarter well Nick Foles started the first couple of games Eagles record 1 &amp; 1 Carson Wentz returning for the next 11 games of five and six record and then foals having to come back in when Wentz and the last couple of games before starving this one Eagles have won both of those with 31 points a game average through that at happy birthday Carson Wentz he'll get his back checked on further but unlikely Peck don't count on him should the Eagles make the playoffs he's not in the plans right now because of the injury so it's up to foals and right now at a scoreless game here the Bears are leading Minnesota in their game seven to nothing Foles two Scrolls good ruling the run and he goes up the sideline up near the 35 so he stepped out at the 33 but good enough for a first down just a great great element in this offense you fake him the ball you can either block that guy in protection or just free release them they choose the free release Darren Sproles nice job by Nick Foles getting it over the top and just a great addition to this offensive group with Darren Sproles back healthy after that hamstring now pick up of a dozen as Smallwood comes in that's angle or in motion when dehl Smallwood with him priests first down up across the 45 yard line haha Clutton dicks brought him down but another Eagle first down now we had Wendel Smallwood in the lineup back when we had the Eagles versus the Coles week three and and I was really impressed with his physicality running the football so one of the guys a little bit undersized and you think he's more of his feats gap back but he ran real physically picked up 13 the injuries you mentioned with a giant Clemente to the running stable Josh Adams is back in at the 46 of Philadelphia and I'm straight ahead meant hard this time and maybe back to the line of scrimmage he had a careerhigh 85 rushing yards in the first meeting with the Redskins but his only averaged about 28 yards a game in the last three we're sharing the load with Scrolls back and Smallwood it's tough to run on this Redskin team when you go towards the middle when you got Durant Payne and Jonathan Allen Caleb Ben Brantley in today format iodide is but that's a big group of three guys inside it's a flip to Nelson Bangalore and he's got another eagle first down a creative run Doug Peters yeah they're gonna make you hear that that's saying you'll hear Sean McVeigh say we make you defend every blade of grass on the field and that's kind of sideline to sideline so we've seen some of the power game up inside now here you go let's test the perimeter let's see how they are with their run support coming out of the secondary 10 yard pickup 43 yard line of Washington each team has had the ball on offense three times just over four minutes in a scoreless opening quarter Scrolls in the back to you quick pass Tallis Goddard knocked out of bounds after making the catch of course Zach Ertz the starting tight end set the NFL reception record already in a single season for a tight end but Goddard's emergence has really helped this team out what it helps you do Chris is is you line up with one running back to tight ends two wide receivers and you really don't know what the Eagles are going to call you saw Nelson a galore on that last one where it's kind of looks like a pass formation but they come in with a run so the emergence of Dallas Goddard has really put stress on defenses to have to defend run and pass out of that personnel from the 40 but packs to Smallwood to Redskins gather omim as he has held in bounds to give DeShazer ever and credit for the tackle he had the interception earlier on that washington defense and a defense that is moving on from DJ swear injure they've had other injuries Sayed Monty Nicholson who was placed on the reserve list after his arrest charged earlier Dunbar had an injury on third and four Foles Belgium Jeffrey has it and yes he stayed inbounds where these two have a chemistry that you he wants everybody up to the line and a quick snap so there's no chance to challenge here that's Josh Norman wondering if he kept his feet him it was ruled a catch and a 16yard pickup announced in the history books as Scrolls gets back to the 21 yard line let's take a look at the feet well the officials can't do anything about it but we sure can let's go back and see if this was a completion in bounce he secures the catch there's one foot down does he get that second one any half possession that was still moving a little bit good footwork but there's the two feet down Asher looked like he had it secured now he's going to the ground so does he maintain possession it sure looks like he did I think I'd give that a catch the way it was called on the field yeah ma I didn't want to miss he's being checked that's Jeffrey over on the sidelines he came out of the game last week beat up after no game holes scrolls who's tackled right away maybe and Moreau on Scrolls who's in his 14th season he played in the last four games he missed ten before that because of that hamstring and it was an important part of the offense that was missing when you talk about quarterback injury and receivers being shuffled around and other running backs he's a matchup problem for a defense who you gonna put on you know that's one of the things that Darren Sproles has done throughout his career and if you can get him in space those return skills become very evident on third and ten they were down here before suffered an interception the custom of scoring opportunity folds the quick pass and the catch is made going out of Bounce golden tape but he's going to be short of the first down and this is not for a team that's gone for it the second most on fourth down this is not a situation where Doug Peterson wants to fool around and what has been an early defensive struggle so here comes Jake Elliott on the field goal unit yeah get some points on the board you had a nice opening drive that ended with that interception he gave up the opportunity to try for points so let's get some points on the board he kicked the gamewinner his time expired from 35 yards away last week from 33 the Eagles take the lead with just 22 seconds remaining the in the opening quarter Eagles settle for three on a drive that covered more than 60 yards and six minutes in a defensive battle in the opening quarter bitches he folds seven for 750 yards that some of that read and react and taking what the defense is giving you they haven't given him those big shots down the field at this point Byron Marshall back to receive from his goal on on the return for the Redskins up across the 22 yard line the NFC playoff picture the Saints have the number one seed the Rams who have a 14nothing advantage over the 49ers can nail down the second seed the Eagles need to win and hope the Vikings lose to get that final NFC playoff spot and right now the Bears lead seven to nothing with under a minute to go in the opening quarter and the Cowboys got their tenth win earlier today resting Ezekiel Elliott but a dramatic comefrombehind win against the Giants yeah great throw and catch dak Prescott to Cole Beasley great job in the back of the end zone getting the twopoint play and then Holden holding the Giants off at the end Cowboys will be hosting a playoff game Chris long looking in couple of sacks in the big win last week brother Kyle has been playing today for the Bears as well as Peterson is brought down Ottawa and the opening quarter should wind down the game plan Jay Gruden would like to see Peters and get his hands on the football 25 times or more but trailing three nothing we'll see how that plays out it's a close one so far but the Eagles have a three nothing lead after one at FedEx Field or open on the field Darrell Johnston Chris Myers the NFL on Fox while you're with us from FedEx Field start of the second quarter and him game in which the playoffs hang in the balance for Philadelphia and Washington taking over on offense with Josh Johnson who is the fourth quarterback the inside Mark Sanchez when Colt McCoy went down because they thought he had some playoff experience behind a young backup and then when he was injured they had to go out and get somebody else and Johnson had been in the system with Jay Gruden and Cincinnati and Tampa and has produced under the circumstances Byron Marshall splits out as a receiver bottom of your screen in the running back Thompson as the top of your screen interesting formation second at 11 and open downfield for a first out catch at the 43 is Josh dachshund dachshund coming out of that inside spot and you know one of the things that that Josh Johnson told us was as he's kind of going through this whole process and trying to show you know his skills to the rest of the NFL is his ability to prepare and execute in the offense I remember he's only been here a few weeks and running empty formations and that that shows you how far along he's come since that first week pick up a 20 it's Peterson had ridden with nowhere to go only on Josh Johnson when you look at his career 13 different NFL franchises have had him either in their camp or under contracts his third start since been signed by Washington he's even played for the Sacramento mountain lions of the UFL and under contract to the San Diego fleet of the aaf played for both John Bruton and Jay Gruden but just grateful never blamed anybody for being bounced around the league but has always kept his focus on trying to play in the league and survive and that's still his plan beyond this year pressured coming he steps up away Johnson to midfield Malcolm Jenkins brought him down that's the mobility that helps house Josh Johnson absolutely this was an issue last week for the Eagles defense against as Shaun Watson in the Texans they had him bottled up but couldn't get him to the ground exactly the same thing here it looks like they've got Josh Johnson sacked right there but he's able to break away and get a positive game so now it's third and 2 after he got 7 out of that it was Fletcher Cox and Michael Bennett for that Eagle defensive line they just keep coming at you from all over it could be Chris long or Brandon Graham Cody nada Johnson's in trouble not downhill lose yardage coming up from the defensive back spot Rasul Douglas already having a big game with an interception and a sack there yeah I think it was Michael Bennett on the inside let's see if Michael Bennett just gets right up the field immediately beats the down block a just an athletic move kind of pushes it out there's Brandon Graham up the field so I mean you had your two inside guys up the field that forced Josh Johnson to run the ball well that play was dead at the snap tres why is the only putter without a touch back scrolls has that fair catch at the 13 yard line the Eagle defense protecting a three nothing lead Foles and scrolls on offense in a moment well the defending Super Bowl champs need the wind to get in and Viking loss and the score bears lead Minnesota in Minnesota 7 nothing under 13 minutes to go before the half on that game Eagles with a three nothing lead here as they take over on offense from their own 18 yard line and the Rams at home with a 143 lead over the 49ers try to nail down the 2 seed that's important because then the Bears it would affect their situation they'd be stuck in that 3 seat spot final regularseason Sunday Smallwood the caring and straight ahead tough ROM picked up nine yards or we softballs we've seen him kind of settle down since that first intersection early not surprising because I was talking to Nick who said your mind starts wandering during the game you're thinking about a big play then you force him he said I learned visualization is great but not in football gets your juices going to over like his coach does he said Doug says be patient with the run for me it's a reminder to be patient with the play it doesn't mean I won't take a shot but I won't do anything cute I'm trying not to force it let the game part Smallwood gets the first I was a tough hit at the 25 yard line but backtoback runs going back to the reminder because we had more pass attempts than run attempts early but fools this week was talking to the Philadelphia media T and he said in that he found peace in that and calm in the midst of that the biggest game of you can play on the Super Ball but when the season started he kind of lost that it got caught up in thinking about all the other things then going to the bench and coming back he's kind of refocused but with a running game that will bail out any completion at the 34yard line and there's a great example what Laura talked about just being patient with the passing game the same way the duck Peterson is with the run game and you know one of the things that I've really enjoyed about our conversation was him staying in the moment and you pointed out that that's why that game last year in the Super Bowl he was able to perform the way he did he doesn't put too much pressure on himself he he reads reacts he takes what the defense gives him stays in that moment as well as anybody I've ever had the opportunity to discuss with second catch for gel Geoffrey jet perch does not have a catch yet Sproles on the line and a good tip with the 34 yard line looks a lot of Curt Menefee for a game break Curtain hello Chris Meyers well the Ravens are 5 and 1 since Lamar Jackson took over at quarterback he's got two rushing touchdowns in the first half against Cleveland today they're up 17 7 and as you know if they win the game they also win the AFC North terrific coaching job there by John Harbaugh Thank You Curt the Chiefs 14nothing lead over Oakland at home they nail down the number one seed in the AFC if they hang on in third and two the pitch two strolls works as well and gets the first down not running for a guy five foot six yeah third and two but watch how far he is pressed in the backfield I mean he's six yards deep at that time just gets around Preston Smith and able to get the yards for the first down when you look at the accomplishments of a guy who is the only player in NFL history 30 receiving touchdowns 20 rushing touchdowns a punt return and a kickoff return for a touchdown and still going strong for Philadelphia Falls Sean Jeffrey with a first down catch across midfield there's another Knights throw right there it's Pernell McPhee who's got pressure rate in Nick Foles in space and we remember the throw last week with Jadeveon Clowney coming right up the middle putting the big hit on him kind of similar to that but great location able to hang in there he talked about wolves being a selfproclaimed reactionary quarterback he also played some hoops in his day good basketball player he sees himself as a kind of a point guard and distributor he's already got into six different receivers today and like he tells us you they can dribble it up court you don't exactly know where you're gonna go but you'll hit the open guy or taking yourself and hear if you can get rid of it he does to Dallas Connor to make something out of nothing getting back near the original line of scrimmage Ryan Kerrigan did say that this week there was a high level of intensity in practice on this Redskin defense even though they know they have no shot at the playoffs yeah it's always confusing to me when when people on the outside ask you know what's your motivation you're on a football field playing in the NFL for your team and all your peers are gonna see that film at some point and you don't want to have the reputation as somebody that doesn't play hard every step so these Eagles need to be ready for the best at this Redskin defense can give Adam foals from a pocket dumps it off to Josh Adams working down the sideline he'll be short of the first down yeah every game means something there are just degrees of whether it's playoff worthy or job security worthy or paycheck worthy are getting a paycheck for being out there yet it's your job it's your job to go out there and perform and on that play right there again it's another great example of up Nick Hall staying in the moment and being smart with the football there was a oneonone down the field and we've heard that he likes to give more opportunity on the 50/50 ball and he didn't take that shot because there was something that he didn't like and he checked it down third and two redskins show extra pressure they only rushed for full steps up and gets the first down making the catch was Nelson a galore at the 35 yard line it really has gotten himself into a rhythm and it is really kind of a credit of what he learned in Chip Kelly's office because that was kind of a foundational component of taking what the defense is giving you there that Frank Wright you know last season talking to him and telling him listen you're not that Peyton Manning guy you're not a dissector of Defense's and and you know where the ball should go in attacking schemes you're a guy that drops back and finds the open guy and gets it to him and that was really beneficial for Nick to hear 13 straight completions on first downs foals will try to make it 14 straight and he's going to go down sack for the Redskins at the 40yard line he hesitated and then Sean Dion Hamilton the rookie from Alabama knocked him down it's another example of the coverage that the Redskins secondary is is playing with today and Josh Adams is in pass protection got to keep working on that you know your quarterbacks moving around so you got it just lock on to your guy and finish because right now this this secondary for the Redskins doing a nice job in coverage I mean the possession time is nearly 3 to 1 Eagles have half the ball over the Redskins it's only a three nothing game after a loss of 5 from the 40 of Washington Foles dumps it off to Smallwood and he fights to get down to the 33 yard line short of the first down but closer to field goal range and a more realistic third down possibility conversions Eagles have attempted 18 throws in this game and they've attempted 11 runs so the ratio favoring the pass but it's that kind of a game under five to play before half need to get to the 25 for a first down extra pressure dumps it on Smallwood with one he spends for a first down and the Eagle fans here at FedEx Field 11 inside the 25 on the Redskins just trust your guys around you to go out and make plays you're trying to get the ball downfield this is third and eight you can see right now they're gonna blitz oh it's in mantoman so you've got a lot of area when you drop that ball down to Wendell Smallwood trust that he's gonna make the run after the catch to get to the first and third catch of the game for Smallwood lifelong Eagle fan grew up admiring in Wilmington Delaware firing to Staley and Brian Westbrook horses position coach Staley rolls checks back in an alarm ocean rose yes it's at that's one a yard line make some foster brings them down as you pointed out in the Eagles right now dominating with the article time and time of position but it's only three to nothing and this is critical right now for this team to be able to get a touchdown right here and make this a two possession game Doug Peterson's offense has over a hundred eighty yards already total yards in this game for Jay Gruden his team has yet to reach 25 yards of total offense high snap handled Scrolls hasn't met right away and shoved back at the 20yard line now you never know what's gonna happen from play to play and when you're controlling the game like this with the stakes that are involved in what each season has been to these two teams the longer you allow a team like the Redskins to stay in this game you give them the opportunity to make one of those momentum swing change place and all of a sudden all that hard work you've put in kind of goes away so father Redskin defense is carrying them but Peterson who would love to he's got some trick plays up and sleeve we just don't know when we're gonna see him on third and five in field goal range Zach Ertz has yet to catch a pass he's been targeted once Falls dumps it off short and verts let's see where they spot it not enough for the first down this will be an interesting decision for Doug Peterson you talked about it on that last opportunity when they they kick the field goal instead get your points there now you've got your points but you haven't gotten anything with all the yards and all the time of possession looks like he's going to go right here if they've been good 59% of the time and again only the one other team has gone for it more than the Eagles on fourth down protecting a three nothing lead a fourth down decision it appears the Eagles aren't going for it piece a halftime report coming up the cheats with a twenty one nothing lead can nail down the top seed in the AFC the Ravens are leading the Browns by 10 they can lock up the AFC North the Steelers trail Cincinnati but the big picture here and so far so good for the defending Super Bowl champs because the Bears lead Minnesota 7 to nothing under 8 minutes to play before the half in that game and the Eagles with a three nothing advantage and going for it on fourth and short from the 15 of Washington and as you know an eagle win and a Viking loss and Philly's back in it great effort by zacchara's to put them in the position to make this decision to go forward on the floor Falls keeps it searches forward first ever you know not just the simple quarterback sneak style right you got trips out to the right emotion Nelson a galore back in you make the defense think a little bit and then a great surge by that offensive line of the Philadelphia Eagles clock running here each team with three timeouts smallwood the back sanguine Eagles male false start offense number 61 fiveyard penalty still first down Wisniewski who is in at the left guard spot for Isaac's a Malo but it looked like it wasn't a clean QB Center exchange either between Jason Kelsey and Nick Foles doesn't have a timeout I think Doug Peterson wants that just to discuss on first and 15 he had a big swing at this moment in the game Darrel from the standpoint that you just talked about you dominate against the Redskins and yet you just don't want to add three if you get seven it's a big mountain decline for this Redskin office ah Fetchit penalty inside a two minutes to avoid the tensecond runoff Doug Peterson used the timeout instead wants that to work with and the continuing domination and time of possession but that's only worth bragging about if you score at the end of it absolutely I mean if you're forced into a field goal here it's still a onepossession game even with a ball as long as they've had it on first and 15 scrolls gets inside the 15 inside the 10 and knocked down around late 7 yard line just coming at the Redskin defense with a number of different runs you've seen the power inside we've seen some stuff that gets on the edge very quickly and here we are on the edge again really nice job by Jason Peters with the field right there with Preston Smith 94 the defensive end lined up a cross room he knows if he goes inside he's not going to tackle Darren Sproles on the edge he was able to get up to that second level be more effective now this Drive already has taken more than 11 minutes this drive alone and the Eagles want to use up the clock and score and they're set to receive the second half kickoff folds inside handoff Smallwood and Smallwood's fighting not back as he got the first down but not the touchdown and a timeout Eagles 33 seconds Eagles with a three nothing advantage trying to get more and keep playoff hopes alive things are falling right for the Eagles the Bears with a 13 nothing lead missed extra point there over the Vikings in Minnesota if that were to hold and the Eagles were to hang out and win here last spot the NFC playoffs goes to Philadelphia they just showed it on the scoreboard here which is filled with Eagle fans along with Redskins fans what a bitch here went up for the defending Super Bowl champs and the other part of that that whole equation is right now that Chargers or their I'm sorry the Rams up 21 three on San Francisco so do the Chicago Bears make any types of adjustments I don't think so I think they're going to play that game to win one timeout left Eagles nobody in a handed two foals throws endzone catch she held on it's a touchdown outside Geoffrey great location on the throw by Nick Foles on the move wanting to go underneath and really good job defensively to get when del Smallwood so he goes to his next option Josh Norman's in good coverage and able to get it through there great job by all Shawn Jeffery at the point of the catch I mean Norman had has had his armor there he's only six feet Jeffery at six three and has the the reach with those arms what an excellent play looks to have a kind of great chemistry Jeffrey and folds the extra point from Elliot who's already hit a field goal today and now it's looking good for the defending chance ten nothing and the Bears continue to lead Minnesota by the score of 13 to nothing as they go late into the second quarter now that was a magical moment for the Eagles last year when wench was injured and foals took over this is more than just foals team there's a real comfort level with this Eagle team Doug Peterson talked about the veterans when they hit the crossroads of the season how they pulled together and are playing some of their best football yeah it's amazing how sometimes adversity really kind of forges that team together they got blown out by the Saints the next week against the Giants they're down 19 3 and at that point you know if you don't win that game it's over I mean you're not gonna have anything to play for so the veteran leadership kind of you know angered by their performance against the Saints but then against the Giants they'll all say that was the defining moment of this season so in backtoback weeks this team kind of came together they've gotten healthier as we said at the top everybody else in the NFC you don't want to see this team right now they're very confident and the little reminder about running the football you just saw that's their longest drive of the season in terms if you talk about time of possession they got the result the Eagles wanted with a touchdown and now kicking off and it'll be a touchback tomorrow the Red Box Bowl or I get a Michigan at 2:30 Eastern on Fox college football bowl games on fs1 the Utes these these youths from Utah take on Northwestern in the san diego county credit union holiday bowl that's at 6:30 Eastern streaming on the fox sports app Michigan State taking on Oregon in the Redbox Bowl on Fox and the domination Philadelphia paying off all three timeouts for just Johnson who's hit as he throws and it's incomplete the pressure bite Brandon Graham and they're gonna rule it they should rule it as an incompletion let's double check here Josh Johnson saying that his hand was going forward and it was yes but the Eagle defense the one constant as the Eagles are discussing the lien the ruling of C with Craig roster by rule the ball when you return to the spot of the fumble second down now winner they're calling that a fumble yeah sure look like we've seen complete arm was going forward inside two minutes it's gonna be a booth review of it and they should take a closer look at that yeah we talked about the margin of error for Jay Gruden and his team and again just plays like that you know second intent his whole lot better for this group then second in 17 or first at 17 I mean the Redskins have three rush yards in the first half of this game they've held the ball for less than six minutes and Josh Johnson has suffered an interception and the ruling on the field it looked like they initially said incomplete but then they said it was a fumble arm forward and if that ball is in his hand the whole together that comes forward it has not redirected the ball itself and the defender Graham does not get his hands on the ball with as our rules analyst Dean when do you know who did this for the NFL and does this for Fox Dean how do you see this hand coming forward with control starts the fourth passive motion to me it does look like he has control of the football the hand starts forward you can see it coming up here on this angle watch the hand does he have control of it right there forward passing motion starts to me this is an incomplete pass they'll reset the clock and go back to the previous five all right Thank You Dean that's what they should do let's listen the quarterback had control the ball as the ball is coming forward therefore is it incomplete pass timer please reset the game clock to 25 seconds every second now replay working as it should twentyfive seconds all three timeouts member Washington to start the second half will be kicking off to the Eagles that Bears score 13 nothing under three minutes to go before the half Rams are up 21 three at home against the 49ers to nail down the second seed in the NFC it's a delay at a crowd as Chris Thompson spins and it's knocked out short of a first down up around the 33 34 yard line quick timeout by Washington with 20 seconds remaining wanted they go back to what we touched on a key turning point and after that embarrassing loss that the Eagles had to the Saints of a gun Peterson said look I was angry the team was angry and go one way or the other our committee our players committee which has certain veterans on it such as Chris long a Carson Wentz and Malcolm Jenkins put it in their hands challenged them and they responded he said the defensive line obviously has been a constant other players had to step up but then coming in winning four of their last five and the only loss that overtime loss to Dallas has changed their season around and put him in position for the playoffs yeah not just angry embarrassed to and that's what you put out that day against that Saints team Eagles chump neutrals on the fraction defense number 55 despite where penalty results in a first down Brandon Graham who put the pressure on last time Josh Johnson a little leaguer this time up at the 39 yard line just two first downs for Washington in this first half compared to 14 by the Eagles Johnson's throne a Chris Thompson and he let him too much incomplete Johnson two out of nine and as I mentioned the running game Adrian Peterson has only had three attempts Peterson who surpassed the thousandyard mark played in all 16 games at age 33 was one of the reasons that they were so competitive last week against Tennessee was the success of the running game they could build off that happen add that today Dobson are but Thompson is tackled right away by Michael Bennett an excellent play and the clock running it looks like the Redskins will let the half run out and the Eagles the playoff possibility is coming closer into focus for Philadelphia look at the play of the first half presented by DIRECTV FedEx Field and the Eagles with a tendon thing leading about ready to receive the second half kickoff that touchdown drive right before the half their longest of the season a number of plays 19 and in time nearly 12 minutes Boston Scott to receive from Dustin Hopkins giggles with the league and the Bears are beating the Vikings 133 at the half which would work in their favor Philadelphia wind Viking loss and the Eagles are back in the playoff to try and go back to back for a Super Bowl title Darryl Johnston Chris Myers a 17 consecutive completions for Nick Foles Redskin defense has played pretty well Eagle defense has played better yeah Nick Foles has gotten into that rhythm that he's talked about and that's not good news for the Redskins but one of the things I thought that was important in our conversations this weekend and Laura mentioned this is the top Doug Peterson don't lose focus on what we need to do during the course of the game and that last drive was just phenomenal because they played really well but they didn't have a whole lot to show for it at that time and I think Doug Peterson patience with the run and I think he knows he's his defense against a Redskin offense that is limited he can play things a little bit more close to the vest they did go for it on a fourth down to continue that drive and converted here to Josh Adams who fights hard to get up across the 30yard line Horeb I asked doc Peterson dominated in yards who dominated in time why were Point so hard to come by he said we selfdestructed always saying we had that interception that turned over but we settled down and settled in we've got to now run the ball and execute in the red zone Jay Gruden said first downs have been terrible on both sides of the ball we got to get a drive together offensively and keep our defense fresh all right thank you holes 17 straight completions that's one completion away from the eagle single game record Donovan McNabb completed 18 straight with a first down rod up to the 39 yard line and that's what you want to be able to do with your run game you can be patient with it you can commit to it you can get stubborn with it however your coaches wanna to make that connection the big thing is being able to run the football effectively when the defense knows that's what you're going to do so that's what they're gonna try to do here in the second half how much success do they have in that run game and the Eagles who have the football nearly 25 minutes compared to six for the red skin so that Washington defense may be wearing down even with a halftime break Josh Adams is back in Foles 18 straight completions as Adams get the first down near midfield that's highs an eagle single game record let's get a game break with Carissa thanks so much Krystal while you guys were at half the Vikings trying to chip away at the Bears lead Dan Bailey hits this 45yard field goal to put the Vikings on the board down 10 at half you know the deal they need a win to get in we're watching it closely as are the Eagle fans at Eagle players here that have a chance to glance up at the scoreboard Rams with a 28 3 we'd nearing the half so they'll walk up the to see behind the number one seed New Orleans in the NFC what they'll small would into a crowd as the clock continues to run boss over in the AFC Kansas City at the half 21 3 you saw the Visa halftime report they hang on to win they get the top seed and the Patriots who won and are waiting get a first round bye they would be the second seed in the AFC chargers leading Denver 7 3 of the half Ravens up on the Browns 20 to 7 Bengals lead Pittsburgh 10 3 of the head and Seattle the five seen as a onepoint lead over the Cardinals Hector Zach Ertz and motion is what catch so far said I like that too still slightly down but the whistle blew before he got inside the 45 when you've got pressure it's always good to have somebody you can count on to get the ball too quickly and you're gonna watch the Blitz they're right fifty one's gonna come through clean and get a free run right at the quarterback and you've got a solution right there with Zach Ertz to get the ball to and falls with this completion a single game Eagle record consecutive completions of 19 straight over a two game mark McNab owns that at 24 consecutive Smallwood trying to get the first down jump backward it'll be third and short make that fourth down excuse me and the chunk ever looks like the Eagles are pointing as if they want to go for it work form in the first half they have a lot of plays when a first doubt is needed on fourth down it's one of the other elements that Eagle fans have talked about the success the last two games beating the Rams beating the Texans playoff teams was not only the play of the team but also Doug Peterson's approach more aggressive with his plate calls more consistent showing that again here this afternoon and it doesn't still more confidence than an eagle team but at least players have said that now this may change things oh boy penalty here looks like they took too long or did they get a timeout will a game late still four down so now was that Chuck did he just try to draw him off and say hey we'll set up our putter no not at all because the the the play was in motion you know kind of late when the delay game happened so that was that was bad communication bad execution by the offense Eagles miscue so they line up to punt with Johnston and Crowder back at the 10 yard line opening second hand drive stalls fair catch called for inside the 10 that's where Washington will take over on offense you look back over the years these two teams going at at Randall Cunningham a lot more Riggins among those greats to play the Vikings are losing at home at halftime trailing by 10 and the Eagles are winning 10 nothing here if they hold up Eagles are back into the postseason we'll watch this closely throughout the afternoon on Fox final regular season Sunday and the Eagles people were kicking dirt on them five or six weeks ago Adrian Peterson carries with our producer Fran Morrison director Brian lui Darrell Johnson Chris Myers our entire crew and good to be a part of a game on the final Sunday that the last spot in the NFC for a playoff position is up for grabs between the Vikings and Eagles and for the Redskins who look like they might run away in the NFC East after the tenweek mark dealing with injuries among other set backs just trying to finish at eight and eight Josh Johnson will keep and it'll be third down again up across the 15yard line Cory Graham brought him down looking for that crossing route and the intermediate level but defended well by the Eagles I agree with this the decision by Josh Johnson to pull that down try and get something positive with your legs can't have a turnover this deep in your own territory at this stage of the game he's only run three times today Darryl Adrian Peterson has four carries and they've yet to convert on a third down over three see the lopsided total yards fortunate to be in this game if they're thankfully for Washington their defenses hung tough Johnson there's a flag down incomplete it'll be fourth down he was trying to get the Jameson Crowder Redskin offense is out of sync and the Eagle defense is putting the heat on pull me offense goes Oh play sport down Eagles should get the ball back an excellent field position with scrolls standing inside the 35 of the Eagles waving everybody away it's a short kick that bounces and rolls down it's at the 32 Philadelphia where they will take over Eagles with the advantage over Washington getting closer to the playoffs Nick Foles said run it out of the tunnel with the link van and Eagles his greatest moment he still had a lot of them seven touchdown passes in a game went to the Pro Bowl in 2013 23 and 12 record as a starter including the postseason that notable wins Super Bowl MVP and which the Eagles not laughed at the Patriots and he's got 19 straight completions the NFL records already an eagle single game record NFL record is 25 straight in a single game Ryan Tannehill and Phillip Rivers did it this year for the Chargers more importantly wants to block this game up and get back to the postseason and he completes another one to the 39 yard line is sack hurts that was a great location on that pass Sean D on Hamilton thought he had the interception and Zach Kurtz is able to steal it from him watch it's gonna be thrown low and left here comes Shawn Dion Hamilton the right side he can't get there the career of Nick falls a lot of ups and downs thought he never thought he'd come back to Philadelphia and have the kind of moment that he had last year and has another chance this year with another run and realistic and speaking with him last night that he sees in the big picture that unlikely he'll be back with the Eagles next year Josh Adams fights to get to the 39 yard line I think the big thing is how open he was about losing the love of the game you know football is a very challenging sport you practice a lot and don't get a lot of game time and you know he talked about in 2015 of kind of walking away from the game his wife convinced him to give it one more shot he called Andy Reid he brought him in and really the rest is history but I mean that's how close he was at the end of the 2015 15 season to walking away from the game of football you asked him how close he said 100% close his wife Torrey they thought it over when he accepted the role of being a backup that helped and now has worked his way into a bigger role as he completes another one Golden Tate spitting and still going out of bounds for a first down see where they spot this it's going to be a first down either way looks like he crossed midfield this is an element to this offense it they you know really haven't been able to really get engaged by the Golden Tate if everything does work out the way the Eagles are hoping it does today and they get into the playoffs I just think that his role continues to expand I mean this becomes a very difficult offense to defend with a number of weapons they can put at you on the outside and that point guard mentality Foles talked about eight different receivers a flip to a calor the Redskins is hustled out of bounds around mid field and one said to Laura I think it's also some players get so frustrated when they're asked all the time about next year if it's retirement if it's about if another team and Knicks really staying focused saying I want to stay in the moment I'm staying in the present I will talk with my wife about why after the season but he also admitted to us that my body knows your heart knows you know I see the stadium when I'm driving by the house that my daughter has been raised and I'm taking stock to those moments and I do want to soak it in and slow it all down right back realistic though moving other than age 29 and right now he needs to snap the ball and he does just in time his 23rd straight completion and it goes to Jeffrey for a first down here's a guy already with an eagle record for 400 yard passing games and he's adding to a possible well to an eagle record of completions maybe an NFL record consecutive completions all Sean Jeffery coming across in motion trying to get loosened up from that defense and yeah he's he talked to us about rhythm and you know the important thing for me at the beginning of the game is trying to find that rhythm boy is he in a rhythm right now a gain of 19 knocked down at the 31 of Washington as the clock continues to run and when you look back he talked about some of the coaches along the way Chris long a teammate of his with the ramsett man you know through it all he stood strong yeah that was was Chris the top stretch right there and as you pointed out Chris you know Chris long was there so when he came in we asked him he said hey you were there were with Nick in 2015 how was he was he different he goes that's the great thing about Nick Foles he was upbeat he was positive we didn't know that he was struggling and was starting to lose the love of the game at that time he never let the teammates see them he called him relentlessly positive at least outwardly Foles flips the other one completes to Adams he's going to get to the 20yard line for another Eagle first down at another completion of the string continuing four folds and it's just methodical I mean to have a drive like they had to end the first half and then to come back out and have another great Drive like they're having here that's very impressive and you know we talked about rhythm we use that word very casually but you know this is something that he takes very very seriously and you can see the impact it has on this office and you know he and Doug Peterson would rather be throwing that ball downfield I mean he's he's the big play quarterback his chemistry without son Jeffery we've seen it today and yet he's patient as this completion times an NFL record 25 consecutive pass completions equals the 10 a hill rivers record for a 1 game mark as Tate hauled out in again just going through that progression and a good feel understanding your receivers running through windows and and that's another thing as pieces were added to this offense is the whole group getting to know each other in and out of the lineup because of injuries it's hard to build that chemistry that allows you to throw 20 straight complete 25 straight completions meanwhile moving closer to another Eagles score Smallwood just short of the first down there in the third quarter under 10 minutes to go in Minnesota the Bears with a 10point lead rivers credited were a number of coaches including Doug Peterson but Frank Reich the key who could be coach of the year for the Colts who were trying to get into the playoffs they played her tonight against Tennessee but he's the guy who tapped into what his strength was and he says may Knick more selfaware of what he does best doesn't have to overthink things on third and one forward for foals on a first down but it's the most important position on a team but it's played very differently we see that every Sunday you know across the league you know how differently the quarterback position is played by the system that's in place for each team and it was just really a question of Nick being able to tap into how he should be playing that in duck Petersen system and that system look at the domination ball control as Carson Wentz looks on and certainly has done his part as a teammate for foes according to Lehigh Valley Hospital by the way the name Carson since it's coming up on the first deer among the top five names for babies in and around that area of Pennsylvania first and goal Josh Adams get fired but that big friend gets near the 5yard line this chazer Everett making the stop it's like he's hurting a little bit so is the shades there Everett yeah DeShazer Everett has put a couple of big hits on guys during the course of the game coming up and runs support in that middle we will check on the injuries on the field certainly hope they're okay DeShazer Everett get it into the injury tent and interception in the first half of the game Jeremy Reeves the rookie from South Alabama comes in to replace him yeah and that's what the NFL is trying to do with all the rule changes and the emphasis on safety that was shoulder to shoulder but where you can still get some of those burners or just that impact those are two big guys physical guys meeting in the hole at the point of attack meanwhile the Eagles have chewed up the clock are knocking on the door with scrolls in the backfield second and goal big holes and it completes the target was a calor he said that one's on me and he finishes his string of 25 consecutive completions on this one just got it back behind you can see the background with the frustration he knew he had him open and just had it on that back shoulder almost like he tried to guide that what its gonna throw it a galore thinking it would I have to touchdown had he been able to haul it st. play a calor cats made couldn't hold on out of bounds incomplete he thought he crushed the goal on with a football what he's trying to explain there yeah this is gonna be interesting and it does he have the possession this is cool back to all those plays we talked about last season so control two feet football move the element of time night that looks like a touchdown let's well it kicked out afterwards going to the ground right going to the ground but with the goalline it comes in that's a goal different scenario not much of a debate ruled incompletion here comes a challenge I'd duck Peterson he saw the way I go Lord it and why not that's a third down play so that's fourth and goal as they'll take a closer look Philadelphia is challenging the ruling on the field of an incomplete had we'll take a closer look tackle or in the end zone touchdown or not a reversal on the call to catch he's got the two feet down so he's established possession all he has to do is break that plane and it's a touchdown so we're lining up for an extra point Falls to a galore second touchdown pass of this game for Nick Foles after Doug Peterson challenged they got it right on our rules analyst team blandina watching along with us back in Los Angeles agreed on the over term that it was a touchdown and the extra point is good to make it 17 nothing less than a minute and a half remaining in the third I mentioned Dean Blandino and you saw Dean a further clarification on the overturn and the touchdown please yeah good illustration of the catch we'll remember it's control both feet and having the ball long enough to perform an act common to the game so you can see control and both feet and then as soon as he reaches that ball out he's completed the catch now becomes a runner ball breaks the plane and we have a touchdown and if he doesn't get that second step down Dean or come or become that that act common to the game went out to the complete pass yeah yeah it's to have all three parts if he doesn't get all three it's incomplete thank you very much Dean if we don't talk to you I know you'll be watching have a happy new year certainly the Eagles were headed that way it's still 13 three bears over the Vikings under four minutes to play in the third quarter in that game in Minnesota and now a three score difference for Washington the team that has trouble scoring as Eagle fans was it about the twohour drive down the pike they have shown up here at FedEx Chris long an important part of this Eagles success story NFL Walter Payton Man of the Year nominee for the Eagles looking on trying to chase down Josh Johnson whose throw is high but hauled in across the 30 yard line by Michael Floyd now it's it's just really tough for the Redskins now that they've got to play the game a certain style and it's kind of funny you mentioned this at the top Chris it kind of got away from Adrian Peterson that running game came out more relying on Josh Johnson in the passing game kind of playing into that strength of the Philly defense with that pressure that they bring and that defensive line well the quarterback injuries certainly had an effect Chris Thompson was hit hard I had to talk to Bruce Alamut team president of this Washington Redskin team who said that Colt McCoy should recover from his injury for next season don't be so sure about Alex Smith after that devastating injury he went through on his return so they have some decisions to make as the son or Tony Bergstrom who came in with a knee injury excuse me right guard Tony Bergstrom is in pain I think a big one looking at the last two seasons the number of guys that went on IR do the Washington Redskins really take a look at what they're doing in the offseason how they're approaching things during the entire calendar year the amount of injuries that the Jay Gruden has had to deal with the last two years makes it very difficult to evaluate this team and just this year and it's been backtoback years of 20plus on on injured reserve and especially when you have more than the one or two of the same position line quarterback that that catches up the effect Bruce Allen was saying as Jay Gruden told us end of the year I'll I'll sit out with Daniel Snyder we'll go over the season game by game our future whatever the contract status is and we sound said it may take a few days considering the injuries Jay Gruden with a contract I said I assumed your back he said he never knows but Bruce Allen said you can assume Jay Gruden returns as the Redskins head coach to get seven wins out of this team with the injuries they've had it's an accomplishment evil crowd here at FedEx making noise on third down Josh Johnson has to get rid of it the pressure was on with 11 seconds remaining Hester one of the reserve linemen coming in on Jefferson and one of the things we've seen that's happened to Josh Johnson watch the rush lanes by the Eagle defense as they pressure the quarterback they kind of collapsed on top of him he can't step up he can't move forward and that's what you want to be able to do as a quarterback if you have to bail out the backside and then wrap around the advantage goes to the defense so not only a good pass rush by the Eagles but good rush lane integrity it's a fake plant in the past is completed for a first down JHS it hauls in the completion tres way on a fake punch and the Redskins will keep the football a little trickery to try and get closer to scoring at the end of three Eagles 17 nothing good design on the fake by Ben Kawika what you got motion right there that's a font a Maddox the starting safety get some attorneys back and then nice timing and a little speed out with the punter in the gunner tres white out to fortuitous career the punter when it comes to throwing duck Petersen said you know given the circumstances we got to be ready for anything think of it as a Washington special from their special teams and a first down Josh Assam tearing it wide open Jameson Crowder but the ball hung in the air that it was almost intercepted by Cory Graham hard to get a lot on that one as you're rolling out to your right and it floated a little bit give Cory Graham the opportunity to come in and make a play on the ball good job again extending by Josh Johnson he gets outside the pocket just can't get it tight enough to get down there and you can see the recovery by Cory Graham to make that deflection Vikings have tightened things up down just three now against the Bears in the second half we'll get an update show you how that happened in just a moment needles are doing their part they need the Vikings to lose they want to be back to the playoffs Johnson's pass almost intercepted again a little underthrown Malcolm Jenkins was back there Carissa has a game break Chris you just alluded to it now at Eagles fans want to see Kirk Cousins find Stefon Diggs for this twoyard score Vikings still trailing though 13 to 10 Chris thank you very much a threepoint difference they're still late in the third quarter in that game fourth quarter here Eagles because of some stumbles through the course of the season and they'll think of Tennessee and Carolinas and games that got away in the second half they're in this position but fighting to the finish if they get a win and that helped with a blanking loss in the tournament a third and tenth pressure coming Chris long and get completed for Crowder and it'll be fourth down punting unit out you don't want to leave any regrets out there we always talk about at the beginning of the season you're not going to win a championship in the month of September but you sure can lose one in those critical losses to Tennessee and Carolina really having an impact on the Eagles they found a way to win a couple of games early there to start the season the first two weeks but well they let a couple of them slip through their fingers and that's some dramatic wins beating the Rams and the Texans couple of playoff teams it bounced around the 25 and be down so the Eagles back on offense a quarter away from victory last time they had the football a galore put in the end zone Eagles trying to get in the playoffs as a wildcard last wildcard team to win the Super Bowl the Packers with Aaron Rodgers you can see the list of those teams that have historically the Giants behind Eli Manning going back to the Raiders and Broncos and we want to wish a happy healthy New Year to Matt Millen who has gone through heart surgery resting recovering will play with the Redskins course it was on that Raider team that we just mentioned that went on to women the Super Bowl is a wild card one of the good guys in football always representing himself in the game well and glad Matt that you're doing okay a lot of folks out there rooting for him Smallwood carries gets up across the 26 yard line over 300 total yards of offense for the Eagles and they're nearing the hundred yard rush mark yeah but this has been one of those games and when when duck Peterson is patient with a run it's not what everybody thinks it's not going to be a balanced attack it's gonna swing one way towards the pass and you go back to last week against the Houston Texans one of the great defenses with a tremendous pass whereas they threw it 49 times ran at 22 it's the complexion of the game but he talks about being efficient when he is and he says sometimes you'll get your you'll get too I gotta tell the guys are they gonna be pretty foals will keep and get sex Ryan Kerrigan that would be his 13th of the season and camera ghen a perfect segue he was one of those players Darrell when you asked him about DJ's where Andrew was critical that defensive coaching staff and maybe the the practice habits he said no I don't I don't think that's a problem on this defense DJ swear injure the former safety of this Redskin team released on Christmas Eve after previous warnings from the head coach about going outside the building to complain about the operation yeah you don't put the business inside the locker room outside to the press and he had been talked to about that by Jay Gruden earlier this season on a couple of occasions so I applaud him for doing that he had to the locker room is the most important part of your team except away out incomplete for now McPhee making the nice defensive play we've seen him get it over the top a couple of times this game on some of those screen passes but not up for now McPhee that time funding you that comes out so after a run a couple of pass attempts one that holes couldn't get away and then one that got knocked away and just to put a cap on swear injure reclaimed by the Cardinals I say because it was once with that team but there's a reason he's with his fifth team over five different years he has tended to his other coaches say drifted off on his own and doing his own thing on defense Crowder on the punt return and a good return across the 46 yard line developing story here as Nick Foles that last series when he was hit he's now headed to the locker room let's take a look at the time it didn't seem like much but they checked him on the sidelines and he's in pain yeah you can see right there as he's taken down right there that a little bit of a grimace and you wonder if that's just left over from the Jew Debian clowny hit from last week which was just brutal when he took that helmet right in the chest he came out for a play and came back to lead the Eagles to the victory over the Texas Johnson's throw is a target for a first down of the 41 of the Eagles Josh Jackson with the catch of course look at the grimace of pain as they check foals who again has gone to the locker room some Nate son felled the only other active quarterback for the Eagles flag in the air and Johnson on the ground Michael Bennett it's gonna be all sides I still can't believe you plays a game with those shoulder pads on offside defense number 77 it's a fiveyard penalty still first down I would put every pad you afford it me on my body for a game I mean that looks like something that my son used to wear when he was playing lacrosse but you just want to show off the guns weren't shelves today I'm in shells everyday don't worry about it it's got eight sacks this year bothered by a foot injury but toughed it out today for this eagle defense that has shut out the Redskins just over 12 minutes remaining Vikings still trail by three they're in the fourth quarter now against the Bears Johnson best scoring opportunity for Washington a first Thompson wasn't even looking well he actually that little collision right there was very fortunate for the Washington Redskins because Avante Maddox is breaking on that pass because it was a little bit of a miscommunication between Chris Thompson and Josh Johnson Johnson five out of 18 he suffered a first quarter interception just 44 yards through the air total offense for the Redskins 65 yards second and five the completions short of the first down is Chris Thompson Nate Sun felled getting loose over on the Eagle sideline originally drafted by the Redskins in 2016 got in not one play last week the Eagle back up with Carson Wentz inactive Johnson Jersey hole goes down at the 45 yard line Michael Bennett his arms were free he was able to get through and see if the shoulder pence let it slowed his breech down that makes him skinny in turn you know he doesn't get caught up again he's working with Chris long so you got you to speed rushers coming from that same side tough matchup for a guard you know usually the tackles are dealing with the guys that have the speed and athleticism of Michael Bennett all right no know what that's if that's a fly Eagle fly that's a wounded bird their first sack of the game for the Eagles and fourth and 12 now for Washington Johnson the balls out the Eagles a check over on downs regardless of who recovered Fletcher Cox with the heat on along with Chris long and the Redskin offense comes up empty once again Eagles with the football in the league we just talked about the speed on the left side of the deviance of line for the Eagles here's the power on the right side Fletcher Cox just picks up Kyle fuller and drives him back for the sack and only Erin Donald has pressure the quarterback more times this year than Fletcher Cox two of the best in the game Nate son felt comes in and I don't overreact but when Carson Wentz is an active at Nick Foles leaves injured for the moment and you're hoping to get back into the playoffs be watching that injury closely unfolds Adam's cherries and a good run to the 40 Laura I know Chris we were all watching that injury when the camera was on him and we were watching Nick walk into the tunnel I think everybody key myself was looking at that hand of his he was walking out fine but when he got into the tunnel which is private no one could see he stopped and almost leaned down to either catch his breath or was in pain which I wasn't sure about that until I just got the official report it's a chest injury his return is questionable I'll update it if he comes out or if I hear anything else all right thank you very much who was cut last September by the Redskins after one season with the team signed to the eagle practice squad and running the show as Josh ABS is running for a first down on the clock under 10 minutes to go here son fell 26 starts in college in Indiana set a school record there with 61 touchdown passes in his third year of the NFL got a lot of work in the preseason both with Washington and the Eagles but in the bigger story under 12 minutes to go in Minnesota the Bears with a threepoint lead on the football over the Vikings the Eagles on their way to wrapping this up for their ninth win but need that Viking loss to get the final playoff spot on the NFC Josh Adams big hole stays inbounds wisely after getting the first down of the 22 and when you've got your third quarterback on your roster coming in obviously the the second one activated today but he's number three coming into your season you need to lean on everybody else help out your new quarterback in this offensive line and the running game has really stepped up be patient with the run but be efficient with the run right now they're doing both of those and it's a great job because Washington knows in this situation that Philadelphia wants to run the football over a hundred twenty rush yards for Doug Peterson's team and Nick Foles remember we have that string of 25 consecutive completions to equal an NFL single game record and set the Eagle single game record small would knock down runaway at the 10minute mark fairs leading by three over the Vikings and the Eagles defense still wins games when you need them one as they're proving here of course it's a makeshift offense for Washington with all of their injuries but they've gotten their job done that was the the matchup that should have favored Philadelphia their defense against an offense that's been decimated by injuries they did their job today such thoughts taxes complete nelson a girl or he's head to the end zone and he is in for an eagle touchdown his second of the game Eagle fans who made the trip celebrating with the Eagle team and the Redskin defense has been worn down 22 yards check my a galore it into the end zone with the extra point it's not 24 nothing well we just talked about the running game helping out and watch the impact that has on these two linebackers right here they're gonna flow to try and protect the run they get caught in the wash you catch them in man coverage naosan a galore coming underneath and you lose your coverage good play design great play action off of those run plays that you'd called leading up to that the first career multi touchdown game for nelson tagalog which sit i'll Shawn Jeffery make big plays when Foles was in the game but this from Nate son Phil and the Eagles who have played more close games is it a dozen games decided by seven points or fewer that's the most in the in the NFL and this one they have well in hand didn't want to deal with a close one son felt wants the football these women that's rude that can we make a deal here and the kid says all right even though he's know that is tremendous that young man and the young man has a foals jersey arm wearing number nine first career touchdown pass for a sub felled who wants the football and thankfully an eagle fan cooperating with him I'll give you this one but you got to go over there and get me another win doing it back get me something I want I wanted Eagles football Byron Marshall knock down so first she gets a ball there you go after the the Sun felt football pass football excuse me the pass to a kawar was give it back to him so this is that good the Eagles are right you're down to your third string quarterback a backup running back it really wasn't in your plans coming into the season and you're running you're way over your division rival in the NFC East and leading your playoff hopes alive yeah it's what they were supposed to do they were supposed to take care of their business they've come out they've taken care of their business the big question is will the Chicago Bears be able to help them out and we've talked about this throughout the game this is a team that's playing well now the big question mark obviously the nick foles injury you know how does that play into next week if everything falls into place for the Philadelphia Eagles and with Carson Wentz and it's a package a I guess use and there's the youngster who got the football and it's great healthwise in the plants for the Eagles no matter what they do in the playoffs sub fed could be on the spot or reported a chest injury for foals who went to the locker room when you think about his history foals he had a shoulder injury in the preseason played the opener to go back in 2014 in a a fractured clavicle that cost him eight games in 2013 he suffered a hand injury in the concussion in 2013 had a hand injury in 2012 so Falls has had his share of injuries over his career that's his cotton and good enough for a first down Matt Flanagan a rookie from Pittsburgh six minutes to go the Bears have added to their lead now we'll get an update on that in a moment because it's no longer a one score game for the Vikings who if they lose they're out because the Eagles are winning this one you heard the crowd going crazy the Eagle fans here at FedEx Field they saw the score update on the Bears 19 to 10 at the moment did that guy have a turnover wait for the Eagles get an interception in the first quarter okay I guess that's part of the last year was the doc the underdog bast can the Redskins get on a scoreboard we brought down at the 37 but Fletcher Cox but again it's it's Michael Bennett playing that inside position so they're getting it matched up against a guard and it's just it's it's tough watch he's going to come inside on the pass rush now he's the one that creates the pressure that gets Josh Johnson out of the pocket and there's Fletcher Cox coming down the line to clean everything up we see Michael Bennett and Fletcher Cox Brandon Graham kind of controlled this game at the line of scrimmage he says the latest as the Bears have a ninepoint lead under eight minutes to go screen Chris Thompson and the leaf of the year to get that goes down at the 45 and it will bring up a fourth down one of the things that a lot of people have talked about you know about this defense and then making improvements and making strides the number of guys in on the tackle and a lot of great pursuit by the sequel's defense today and they've been outstanding as Doug Peters had pointed out to that the you know the last four or five games the take away ratio the turnovers whether it's been special teams the defense had an interception earlier they've done their part there's added a twopoint conversion so it's a 2110 Chicago lead over the Vikings 24 nothing Eagles here at FedEx near the first down marker and wrestled out of bounds Darvin kids e they rookies from Texas Southern and good enough for the first down just over three and a half so the Rams are locking up with a 45 17 advantage at home against the 49ers the 2 seed in the NFC the Chiefs 35 3 in the fourth or Oakland will get the 1 seed in the AFC with the Patriots and you know with the Patriots when they're a 2 seed and they get a first round by they're usually headed to the Super Bowl one way or another sideline and out of bounds is Michael Floyd Curt Menefee has an update curtain as you mentioned this is why Eagles fans are rejoicing to wreak coin with a little 4 yard score bears get the twopoint conversion and they open up the lead against the Vikings 21 10 Chris moose Laura have you mentioned this scenarios for the Eagles making the playoffs at all we'll get to that when we have time we've been enjoying the scene here at FedEx Field Doug Peterson tough to get back and repeat his team on the doorstep after people that written off the Eagles and they knew about it we touched on that Saints blowout and then trailing against the Giants he called it a galvanizing moment or it was one that he hoped would and they took it and ran how dangerous is this Eagle team heading into the playoffs assuming that the Vikings continue to lose and this holds up number one thing is is how as nick foles what is the health of nick foles other than that the one concern I would have is is really a consistent running game you know doug has talked about being patient with it can they be efficient in the playoff that's that's very important if you're going to make a push that's complete everything else is there they've got a good defense their defensive line you can see the pressure that they can generate now this is an offensive line that's been decimated by injuries how are they going to perform against the playoff teams I think for them the confidence is going out to the west coast in beating the Rams coming back to Philly and knocking off Houston in backtoback weeks that was extremely impressive and the veterans that went through it last year obviously with foals as you said there's a there's a confidence in him especially when they get into the postseason you've got guys like Zach Ertz that are reliable Alshon Jeffrey Aguilar's had a big game that defensive line that's come a big they've worked through injuries in the secondary another past defense they have been happy about that but it's been good enough and a team that's been through it before we showed you wildcard teams that have made Super Bowl runs that had success it's a whole new ballgame we to start the playoffs Eagles just hoping they're in it and that was almost intercepted and don't forget I mean the big thing is they've they're as healthy as they've been all year at this point and obviously it comes back to Nick Foles what is his situation if he's good to go this team is as healthy as they've been all season guys we're coming there's a couple more guys that could be back for next weekend you know I'm Mike Wallace you know the guys that weren't quite ready this week and that there's a number of those guys coming back that we're very close this week Eagles last year eliminated the Vikings in the NFC Championship game and in a way they'll be eliminating them again if they win in the Vikings lose to Chicago tell shots at a shot and the filming took your dance go Fletcher he's back over here got you now you're in between the speed Michael Bennett Chris long and you've got Fletcher Cox in the middle of that that that's that's tough on the right side of the Washington Redskins offensive line a group that's been then beat up all year by injuries and Josh Johnson he's I give him a lot of credit you know he's done a he's done a heck of a job coming up here under very difficult circumstances and performing very well to the point where Chris long said I don't really know why this guy's had to wait so long for this opportunity he had a lot of respect for how he's played under difficult circumstances down the stretch he hung in there that's a fourth sack in this half by the Eagle defense bonus coverage will take you out to the Bears and Vikings in Minnesota when this game wraps up at Eagle fans will be glued to that as will the ego organization they'd have dominated from the start low scoring opening quarter time of possession more than 40 minutes Eagles have had the football less than 17 for the Redskins of Doug Peterson the commitment of the run when he had to he had folds and his 25 consecutive completions and Eagle fans who have supported their team we're going to see them back in the postseason if the Bears hang on a 2110 Chicago advantage in Minnesota under seven minutes to play give you that bonus coverage when we wrap up here two minutes less the two minutes remain in the Redskins season but the Eagles will play on it so appears giggles underdogs against the Patriots the Philly special Nick Foles called it the signature touchdown and sackers the touchdown put up ahead to stay eagle defense held on that final patriot drive and they win their first Super Bowl title in a thrilling 41 33 game against the Patriots Patriots are in Eagles are on their way in but we'll have to do it as a wild card as the sixth seed and if it holds up and the Bears have the football back at an 11 point lead in Minnesota with six minutes left Eagles would play the Chicago Bears of the first round of the playoffs trait Burton the guy who threw the pass you thought by the Phillies special a member of the Chicago Bears and good enough for the first down as the clock will run last time there's the update under six minutes to go there at Minnesota last time the Eagles defense had a shutout 2014 was against the Giants this is another notch in the belt for this team and its fans how about broad pop or Andy Reid out there in Kansas City he's going to the playoffs he's got Doug Peterson possibly gonna be there Matt nag he's gonna be there the ante read tree is looking pretty good here the last couple of years it looked awful for the Eagles after the blowout loss to New Orleans but then beating the Giants feeding the Redskins that overtime loss at Dallas but then beating the Rams in Houston and coming here and flexing their muscles whether it was when sore foals a veteran team back in the playoffs with a win here and less than five minutes to go in Minnesota again bonus coverage coming up there but the Eagles play on and we certainly will keep a close watch on that health quarterback Nick Foles that will be the number one factor moving forward because as Doug Peterson told us yesterday we are playing our best football this season right now eight sub felt coming in relief throwing a touchdown pass 24 nothing as the clock ticks and the Bears have added a field goal they lead now 24 ten in Minnesota with less than four and a half to play that bonus coverage is coming up at Daryl and I will have more from FedEx Field on the Eagles victory in just a moment we're glad you're watching the NFL on Fox you",

  "transcript": "skins and eagles they've been division rivals dating back to nineteen it always has an edge to it doesn't it and right now it's all about who's gonna stay in the with the NFC playoff picture kids were sitting pretty just a few weeks ago atop the NFC East now it's crunch time trip here for the reigning Super Bowl champs of course Dallas the impressive win over the Saints the Rams with controlled homefield advantage for now and things have really changed with this NFC East because of what the Cowboys have done tonight's result critical for these two skins can't afford three straight losses Eagles can't afford the drop two games back of the division lead the Redskins won the toss they defer the Eagles will receive alltime meeting between these two on Monday Night Football and the Eagles have won four straight Monday night errs against Washington Dustin Hopkins has 42 touchbacks this year on his 53 kickoff says Corey Clement let's see if he gets a chance so here comes carson wentz he says time to stop talking about last year and focusing on these next five this is a different scene different year a different team feel free to have your own doubts whatever we want but we know we're capable now it's just time to try and go shop some dude we're gonna play a couple of NFC u s opponents here and see what we're made of at a great visit with him the other day talking about the comeback win the second half against the Giants who says it speaks volumes about the confidence they feel right now yeah he feels like that second half was really ignited him to get on the run here he's gonna start off with a completion to his favorite target in Zach Ertz surprise surprise these two though they have chemistry they understand each other that's his target it's important for the Eagles to start fast nine of their 11 games they have not scored in the first quarter they've been aware of that and they know that they got to get to off to a good start working running back Josh Adams in the backfield with Wentz the rookie is the local kid is born in North Philly played at Central Bucks high school two rookie out of Notre Dame now wince told us he said listen we still believe we're resilient and we have confidence yeah you know he hasn't looked like he did last year as MVP candidate but last week he found that rhythm in the second half against the Giants and he's hoping he can build on that second five as he gives to Adams just a yard the third and four I told you Adams local kids a rookie free agent has emerged at the top running back to the dealing with injuries at running back as well as waived in early September that was on the practice squad and then activated week three and onward he's gotten better yeah he's taking advantage of his opportunities last couple weeks he's really got in the mix here he's a high runner he runs high but he's more inside zone he can hit the hole one cut he's kind of a Adrian Peterson that style run and that's how he wants to attack he can get up on these linebackers sits back into the backfield on third and four as fighting for the extra yardage was al shot Jeffrey you know that's what else Shawn Jeffrey can do guys he's not a blazer down the field but the Tufts physical catches coming across the middle he can do this for you all day long this along with the 50/50 balls is how they have to get out Shawn Jeffery involved in this offense and Josh Norman just he's a tackle that was the problem last week they didn't tackle well going against the Cowboys we saw Amari Cooper take the slant and go 80 plus yards for a touchdown they have got to tackle once they complete these passes plus our offense number 62 fiveyard penalty remains first down versus the Eagles have the bookend tackles Johnson and Peters and in the skilled positions hurts the main target of this office then they apply our Golden Tate tre just before the deadline with the Lions see that little symbol there service will be wearing the monday night Mike tonight look forward to hearing sack hurts throughout the game and Golden Tate he's walked lined up right here he's got to get going they make the trade who's really good running after catch but he hasn't found his way since he's been over here with the Eagles only 11 catches in the last three games with the Eagles first and 15 after the penalty as West continues to extend the beautiful touch passes the ball loose and then goes out of bounds Golden Tate in stride it goes for 22 yards it was Zach Brown who forced it out at the end there yeah they're fake of a jet sweep time is really and of course is trying to keep it alive it's telling golden keep running keep running shows you though I mean you know in that second half against the Giants we saw vintage Carson wins and I think he's got some confidence as he enters tonight that is caught on the slant to Earth's this is the matchup that we're going to be hanging in on Hertz against the safety DJ's we're injured yeah that's a tough challenge for swear and room he's gonna have to come down yo I wouldn't get a swear injure a lot you playoff coverage like that it's gonna be really difficult because this runpass option it's quick wrapped in the chemistry that these two have carson wentz and Zach Ertz I think you really got to get on their face you got to challenge him at the line of scrimmage second and four seventh play of this opening drive Adams as he sniffles his way beyond bricks Stroman her 11 yards well this is what you're going to see out of Josh Adams he wants to come downhill and he has the speed to bounce it outside he's a bigger back but he does have an elusive miss getting outside outside on the edges is where he will attack this Washington defense you want to make 54 Mason foster and number 53 Zac Brown you want to make them run you know what earlier tonight you talked about the struggles with Philadelphia this year they've been playing from behind this is an opportunity to have a really good cash it in opening drive they've been scoreless in the first quarter in the last five games trying to stop that as the whistle comes in and you see them pointing to the Pearl Harbor was the world down by contact the second that was down by contact after eight yards there is Doug Peterson year number three and that's the right attack that he has Doug Peterson this style offense I mean Adams is in between the tackles runner the problem with that is you look across the way pain Jonathan Allen there big thick gapping defense alignment so you're not gonna run it inside so if he's going to give it in there and he has to been cut to the outside like we've seen on these last two runs that's the formula for this Eagles offense the Bama boys Payne and Allen inside for Washington second into Paul comes out again as he was wrestled down by Marone you see mineski there he's the defensive coordinator usually has that smedium shirt on it looks like you can still play and Doug Peterson that's gonna be the battle of how you change it up and one of the things I look for mineski to do tonight is bring pressure inside in between the tackles potentially right over top of the ball because if you come on the outside it doesn't really affect Carson because he can get the ball out quick bringing it inside really affects him he has trouble with that certain one lemon he is met and then gets an extra push and goes ahead for the first down was big Jason Peters with 328 pounds giving him some help there in Clement he just dancing around you got to hit it starting one stop dancing and put it in there fortunately for him Peter's the pick fella just gives them a nice push in the back but you know these backs are still young they're finding their way in this system they have brought some juice to them it's important to have that running game going for the Eagles and down here by the goal line is where I think they should give al Shawn Jeffery a ball throw it up to him he's 64 give them up 50/50 ball let it make a play against Josh Goldman at some point bottom of your screen there this Jeffrey instead they're gonna run it and Adams will get to the 6 yard line and she is taken down by swear injure you know the running game is so important for Doug Peterson it's a rhythm based offense not that they want to do a ton of it but it sets up everything else they want to do in this offense the run pass options the playaction those are the big plays because they don't have that big threat over top that can stretch the field so what does it setup here on 2nd and goal I think it's got some play action potentials so core Zach Ertz you know Golden Tate being in the slot he's got big physical hands he's a guy to keep an eye on as they want to try to get him going here's West to the end zone for the touchdown by Golden Tate his first touchdown as an eagle you know just that's the thing that makes carson wentz who he is he's calm in the pocket but he's got the ability to extend the play and just enough for athletic ability to find gold and tape in the back of the endzone we thought this young Watson was Houdini Carson when she got looking at him to test remember we said they have been scoreless in the first quarter her last five games what a change on a 12 play drive that went nearly seven and a half minutes this is what happened before tonight's national anthem is there was a moment of silence for President George HW Bush who died at age 94 on Friday today the 41st president deeply passionate sports fan left his beloved Texas for the final time heading to Washington DC Alliance State at the US Capitol rotunda before his funeral services on Wednesday President Bush loved his Houston sports teams served our country 20 youngest Navy pilots in history is only 19 years old and he was flying those combat missions in World War two here comes Colt McCoy a proud Texan and he knows this is his chance this league is all about opportunity I've been on the bench for a long time feel comfortable in this system and I trust them I'm gonna let the ball fly it's football we just got to go strap it up and play so the starter Alex Smith suffers the broken leg on November 18th in steps both McCoy ninth year in the league played against Dallas last week through three picks was sacked three times in that loss we tried to check down to the veteran Adrian Peterson and a flag is down we got Tony curenci heading up this crew holding offense number 71 10yard penalty and repeat first down you know Colt McCoy takes over he's a real solid backup I think a lot of Redskins fans thought when Alex Smith went down that they were out of it that's not the case he's been in this offensive system of Jay Gruden's for the last five years he's confident in it I experienced it playing against him in 2014 you know when he started and just put on a clinic and so he's embracing this moment he feels like he's rejuvenated his career and I tell you what every backup quarterback they dreamed having a chance of going in there with playoff implications on the line you're not gonna forget that 2014 Monday night or anytime soon oh yeah Peterson Michael Bennett getting into the backfield but in saying all that it's tough to come on the road you know you have penalties early you cannot do that that is not the formula for this offense you know this is a tough environment to play in there are passionate crowd they're intense here in Philly you know they got reputation back in the day they booed Santa Claus you know look well they booed 82 a pretty good exactly second and 22 heading in the wrong direction as Chris Thompson we'll get the carry here and he is taken down hard at the 20 after a gain of seven Thompson back from injury himself has missed six games this year with broken ribs and that should give Colt McCoy a lot of confidence didn't Chris Thompson I mean he had a phenomenal year last year as that scatback you know and he's quick as a receiver that's the best thing he does on the backfield but he also can run those drawls and get you back on chap trap Jameson Crowder in the slot and Chris Thompson was going to be key factors for Colt McCoy in this offense the Rutland salmon now when he's getting wild for a third and 15 in the guards from the Washington Redskins have got to protect 13:15 Thompson again as it is hardhitting to start things off with his Philly defense that was Fletcher Cox and Malcolm Jenkins colliding on Thomson that's not to start you want for Washington you know you look at these guys and they cannot have penalties it's gonna crush them Darren Sproles who's been dealing with a hamstring injury hadn't practiced since November 7 came back to practice this week but not a game action since week number one got injured against Atlanta and his press way on the plank here Scrolls from the 12 and as he has met at about the 16 so Carson and company ready to get back out there after he went five of five and had the touchdown pass on his first drive ESPN's Monday Night Football is brought to you by GMC live and like a pro Lincoln Financial Field for Monday Night Football critical game between the Eagles and the skins come down the homestretch of this season playoff position second drive for the Eagles after Golden Tate had the touchdown reception Wentz was flawless to open things up Josh Adams and it works we talked about this being a rhythm based offense getting the running game going in and it being effective then opens up the playaction carson wentz standing place shoes in his legs finding this guy Golden Tate Lane Johnson understands that when Carson Wentz gets on the edge just keep blocking he's a playmaker and you'll find guys good connection went outside the pocket on that first drive of whence to tape that's where he got the two receptions for 25 yards and the touchdown second and four that's incomplete as he was looking for a rookie site in Dallas Goddard as for the veteran side ends Eckert's is wearing the monday night Mike that's how we do it that's how we do it that's trust you know and that's how those guys do it you see the right back next to each other when San Earth's a very close relationship third and four with Darren Sproles in the game as the running back as roles is plugged up right away by Mason foster knitting up that run and making the tackle at the line of scrimmage and that's what Mason foster wants to do he wants to come down here he doesn't want to go sideline to sideline he's a big big two gap linebacker nice fielder to hold it everybody yeah and if you're Philadelphia you've got to throw the ball there I mean you got the early lead keep the pedal down don't let up here in the first quarter third and four I would not run the ball between the tackles with Sproles I get him out in space and get my passing game going so the Aussie Cameron Johnston on to punt Stroman feels it and was able to keep his balance but not hit to the edge good coverage by Paul 49yard followed with no return who should trailer debut at halftime playaction McCoy and wide open and complete to toxin that's what they have to do job they got to get the playaction going they don't really have a wide receiver one dachshund is brought in here first round pick they've got attacked these defensive backs for Philadelphia they're beat up and Colt McCoy he feels comfortable in that you know being in the pocket attacking Douglas on the outside these corners they have not held up throughout the last three or four weeks 32 yard catch for the birthday boy today is Josh dachshunds 26th birthday there's the pitch to Thompson he's chucked down at the line of scrimmage by Rasul Douglas mentioned that it was dachshunds birthday you know our guys are always digging for the great family photos alright guys they said we came up with one we found a birthday photo for dachshund as to this either spring as time goes nowhere as a loss of one in fact as Douglas comes up with the play let's get played by Douglas getting out there and playing a little bit of press and getting aggressive the trip Williams the left tackle he's an athletic guy he's trying to get out there and kick it out but Douglas jumped on it putting the Redskins in third and long that's a challenge for Jim Schwartz when you do that with a backup quarterback and keep this crowd involved having success early the Eagles third down and 11 McCoy unable to connect with Crowder and Aflac comes in what / adjacent graduates to the penalty flag pass interference defense number 34 you the manic first down on third and 11 well then they're gonna motion Crowder inside but see how far these guys are playing off certain Tim but they get to a bunch and then they keep backing up he gets the leverage because of the stem until release you got to come up and challenge those guys you can't give them free releases and allow them to capture the outside Jeremy sprinkle who motions back into the backfield kick 250 pounds I then and say well run it with Peterson and the 33 year old Adrian Peterson goes for five as another flag comes in from current age group Parenti who officiated Super Bowl 41 book legal uses the hands hands to the face defense number 53 5 yard penalty first down about you remember book that full victory on that day let's look at the lineups for Washington remember both starting guards the beginning of season out full valve and share if that is a concern then Jordan reads such a weapon yeah Jordan reads the guy leading the team in catches he has unique quickness in and out of his cut for a big physical guy not only him but dachshunds got a step up he's got to make the plays on the outside when it's seen a high coverage there's Peterson I'm able to get past Nathan Gary Gary who's only made three career starts prior to tonight you know they do this run pass option play there which what they're mixing in a little bit with Alec Smith but it really doesn't fit what Adrian does well I mean Adrian's kind of dots the eye in the back kind of one cut and hits it and he is explosive and that is age he can still go he's a straight line speak guys tough to tackle but you saw in that last one it just doesn't find those holes in that IPO game pulsar offense fiveyard penalty remains second down 10 Eagles defense mode it's all about what's up front well no doubt about it that's what their money is test with return again Cox Graham Michael Bennett long those guys they protect the back end their linebackers have been struggling in coverage and we talked about it at nauseam on the back end they played the class who get off the top five corners they got number six hurt they're at a disadvantage on the back end it's up for the front for tonight to get to the quarterback and make life tough for kolten before yeah they get these wide nine techniques it makes life miserable for the tight ends and the tackles they get wide and they pin their ears back second and 14 able escape parks and then goes down as charging up was Jenkins and you bring up that defensive line test inside Fletcher Cox Michael Bennett just coming inside Fletcher Cox is not a flashing rustling he's going to use a lot of power just press and just fighting through but he's going to collapse the pocket and when he does that now Michael Bennett and Chris long come in from the outside they do a very nice job of working off of each other Cox Bennett and also Chris long and of one Redskins offense hasn't scored a first quarter touchdown now five news here tonight in Philly mild weather to this time of year Monday Night Football with the Eagles leading seven nothing against the division rival skins and facing a third and 20s Colt McCoy as he checks down at Chris Thompson and another flag is down this back at the 30 yard line illegal block in the back offense number 71 10yard penalty and repeat they're down just can't have it though you're just trying to get a quick screen out there to Thompson it's lowrisk get six eight yards give yourself a chance for a field goal instead you have a penalty there because your tackles trying to come out and make the block you have to know the situation well number 71 Trent Williams has been banged up and his athletic ability is limited so I got to think that's hampering him from getting outside making those blocks he's the best left tackle in the game when healthy but even he can't get out there when he's hurting but in that moment just take the yards it's more important than getting that block cuz you're in field goal range I'm third and thirty as he just goes underneath to Crowder and makes his way back to the 26 yard line a code by Jenkins and see a little limp out of Colt McCoy now Mark Sanchez was signed as the backup to McCoy this was moments ago as you see his leg hitting the left knee of Jenkins reached down that shin area yeah that can't feel good test no not with all that momentum so Hopkins comes on for the 44 yard attempt he's bothered this year by a groin injury I was a couple weeks ago visit with him last night feeling much better and Washington gets on the board with a field goal from Hopkins tonight on ESPN at 8:00 Eastern it is the 84th annual Heisman Trophy presentation from New York of course finalists all had outstanding seasons to Otunga viola the Alabama quarterback who got injured in the SEC title game I want Murray from Oklahoma to be playing against each other net Capital One Orange Bowl in the cfd semifinal and dwayne Haskins from Ohio State by the way jaylen hurts what a class act backup quarterback at Alabama that's incredible you know I called my kids and told him about that storage awesome for all young athletes out there sticking it out handle it the way he did there's Zach hurts and he's chasing history first Jason would die standing next to me hundred and tenth receptions in 2012 that is the record for a tight end a whole lot of barbecue sauce that you poured on that season there with but Zach Ertz he likes the Philly cheese whiz and he's closing in on that record sitting there at eighty six receptions right now he is on pace to make history this year something tells me that record is gonna get broken winner as Winston a good job just to secure that ball and that's the chemistry right now I love this kid I hope he breaks every one of my records that I have I mean he is just special guy I will say though you know it gets pretty cold up here records are meant to be broken and that's the case in Zach Kurt's I've watched him a lot you know the greatest compliment I can say is my last couple years when I would study and I was very particular who I would study he was one of the guys I looked at because I loved how he loved the football was a student in the game he plays over 95% of the plays he's really improved as a blocker you were studying the young guys now shadow his little stutter step and then taken down by strowman Lisa hey Tess will the Washington training staff has been working on Colt McCoy's right ankle since he came off the field no official word on his status but Mark Sanchez is now up and warming up how about that Mark Sanchez medicine here to Philly a sign Sanchez he is familiarity an overlap with the coaching staff in Washington at Kavanaugh an offensive coordinator as the Jets quarterback coach when Sanchez played in New York I was one of the citing factors so Sanchez warming up on the Redskins sideline as it's a third and six here for West pocket collapsing and he goes down as a flag is down at the 36 pain and brown collapsing on Wentz holding defense number 36 they are kind of automatic first now boys trying to play Zach Ertz mantoman he's jumping inside like that you see the stem of Earth's and then he gets back on top of him it's a good route and swearin just having a hard time he's playing off of him I think with the urge you got to get right up on the line of scrimmage you got to be physical with them disrupt him early because tight ends that don't have that speed and forces the quarterback to get off of him Mike also penalty for Washington play action on first down West with a strike and yet another catch hurts 20yard reception what's good call but Doug Peterson he's gonna take both tight ends and put him on a play action I mean let's first I didn't take it you see the movement he goes in and out and back in and then back out and he finds that area big radius catch rate is there that Carson can lean on him do it a number different ways we seen him do the run passing we'd seen him being split out wide he's the traditional tight in he's the tight in off the ball high football IQ Zach Ertz scrolls trying to wiggle for it mixes waves in the 43 Lisa anything else with Mikoyan Sanchez you can offer yeah it's called the Colt McCoy just went back to the locker room Washington is saying it's a lower right lower leg injury his return is questionable but I saw him when he got up and tried to throw tried to backpedal said to the training staff I can't that's when he headed back you can see the noticeable went there is Mark Sanchez loosening up so number five overall pick all the way back in 2009 out of USC seven West beyond Agra war as Murrow was in coverage and when swishes he had that one back test that's the thing I've been waiting to see more from this Philadelphia Eagle offense everyone wants to talk about what's different last and last year to this year for me it's throwing the football down the field getting a galore and Geoffrey more involved Redskins play mantoman never a little pick round and parcel in just a little bit off on his deep ball something to watch for Josh Norman has been following Al Shean gypsy a lot tonight he's matched up in instant once again to bottom of the screen there is seven pressure gets it complete as he finds Matthews and a flag is down at the 33 it was McPhee coming in hard on whence pass interference offense number 80 10yard penalty a repeat they're down they're gonna call that on Matthews he's coming in there and they're playing mantoman and so in that when you do that it's a good stem inside then you got to capture the outside you once you get to the top of it and be careful extending that arm you know Moreau falls down like that they're gonna call it every single time might have been a nice sale job Bob Monroe we die I don't know if he pushed in that hard yeah but once you capture I'm with you but once you capture that outside shoulder right just get the little flipper and break out you got him feet you got the leverage you want is that how you got away with the pass interference absolutely 1:17 whence drives the ball incomplete as it was a little too high for a galore Moreau with coverage again so now if you're Jay Gruden look Mark Sanchez has been there less than two weeks right so the PlayBook that G's sake a cheesecake menu that you have that things out the window you got to regroup and you got to simplify the plan because he's been there less than two weeks and this is where the challenge of being the head coach and in the play collar you have to understand you know what he does well and Jay Gruden said that we wanted to give him reps during this time to is the backup quarterback so he feels comfortable Johnson with a knuckleballer as Harris will secure inside the 10 and that means Mark Sanchez is going to come in and play quarterback with a lower leg injury and here comes Mark Sanchez who they signed on November 19th Mark Sanchez his last game action was here week 17 of 2016 at the Eagles with the Cowboys he's back neechan Peterson is going to help look at the 33 Peterson your touchdown and with that comes history for ad day 106 career rushing touchdowns now where I talked about he's going to be a one cut system it's inside zone he makes that one cut his lineman gets the box on the second level and he's gone he still has that speed those guys he's wired differently big long Strider he's done it for a long time and you know what Mark Sanchez as best friends gonna be the rest of this game is that running game in Canadian Peterson after all those years all the runs all the records that is a career long for Adrian Peterson a dream Peterson never had a 90yard run in his great career at Oklahoma nor in the NFL and then moments ago here at 33 years old with Mark Sanchez coming in to play quarterback on the first play there he goes he's gonna get a lot more carries tonight I mean you know what an addition he's been to this offense you know and they made this guy Hall of Famer go through a workout back early in the year and he is not disappointed glory planet on the return as he bounces and then gets a little extra yards I want to tell you about the history for Peterson because I've mentioned 106 career rushing touchdowns down so now he gets to sit with this group of alltime rushing gods and of course number one and rushing touchdowns but he just tied in round by the way all five of those men sitting up there first ballot Hall of Famers I think agent Peterson is gonna add to that list test 106 career rushing touchdowns and what a way to tie Jim Brown with a 90 yarder Wes was trying to find Earth's in stride yeahyou we talked about earlier he's missed a couple of these throws that was a run pass option off of that and listen we're talking about urge he gets hurts on Ryan Kerrigan oneonone on Ryan Kerrigan that may be another one that goes to the house it was like we saw Peterson you can't miss on those throws but wait if we think about what's the difference with Carson Wentz isn't it that the ability to hit Aguila on that go route down the sideline they're billeted here urged he's got to be able to do that he did it last year not doing it this year Adams trying to fold and find something instead he's written down by Preston Smith I think when you're coming off an injury like that book you know it becomes challenging because your first live reps is in real games right so you got to step into those throws and all your rehab is about you know having that stability in the knee and getting confidence with that and he talked about he really felt like he improved his arm strength his leg strength but then he's got to have that ability I get the limp of Colt McCoy Redskins starting quarterback and headed off after being hit in the right lower leg third down and nine and there he connects with Jeffery for a first down you know in Josh Norman has been matched up quite a few times tonight against Alshon Jeffrey Norman is a better off corner he doesn't want to get up and play physical press mantoman Alshon Jeffrey nice release and he beats Josh Norman Lika from I would come back to this matchup often if I were the Philadelphia Eagles and he's got inside leverage on Jeffrey Wright Jeffrey's not a speed player so just play that inside hit do not allow him to then come back inside it's all about technique for Josh Norman when he's pressing him like that with that inside leverage at 63 nearly 220 pounds works out pretty well doesn't it here's Wentz yes again downfield and once again and it's a Chuck play as that goes for 39 yards well it's a playaction and good job by Clement to pick up this place right there by brown and then wince getting outside the pocket that's what he's done we talked about last year you know he was an MVP candidate it was plays like this the accuracy to hit a girl or on the playaction when the play breaks down extending it it's just really uncanny to find a guy that size to be able to move like that and throw with that accuracy on the run that's what makes Carson Wentz special pretty special era Sears written down at the 20yard line that time by McPhee Lisa what can you tell us about that scene we just saw yeah test what you saw just a few moments ago was Colt McCoy coming out of the xray room here at Lincoln Financial Field and what you saw is what I saw he looked like he was in a considerable amount of pain noticing considerably when I have an official word on his status I will let you know thank you Lisa Nicole talked about the opportunity this stage of his career five years in this system nine year gets a chance with Smith injure now the left with Mark Sanchez at quarterback second and seven as working his way inside the Potters curse Hertz has just got such good feel is to block it and then he gets a play that she's good bootleg kick him on the edge and he's gets it Anderson the big ability to sell it he blocks it 1,001 1,002 and then lets him go and it's a feel thing you can't really teach that of how long you got to hold those blocks on those bootlegs but you know the best tight ends they understand it and Zach Kurtz does it better than anyone got five receptions by the way Ryan Anderson still down at the end of that play talked about the relationship weren't going to the postseason and they were they were going on the playoff run and I just admire him and for him that he's communicated that over the years of how much he appreciates me and studying my tape and you know I wanted to give him that jersey and you weren't one of these guys that did the Jersey swap thing that's the only time you've done it and it's the final jersey of your career yeah you know I never was one of those that kind of went back and forth with the Jersey swap you know I kind of got in the locker room soon after the game and that was the only one I did so Zach Kurt's got my last Jersey Jersey so he's on pace to beat your alltime record in a single season here we go first and goal incomplete as he was trying to connect with Matthews you know test we asked him what you know where that jersey was Jesse I'm talking about it you know he told us he said hey it's in my closet I said you know what happened you went and won a Super Bowl so that Jersey just got thrown away you know that Jersey got a friend that thing with what are we looking here on second and gold book you know test for me if I'm the Redskins I'm gonna bring pressure up in the a gobs to make Carson Wentz uncomfortable look at the top of the screen you got an inverted stack with Aguilar and Jeffrey find anything that time there was a wall in front of them and then Kerrigan coming from behind that's a loss of one so the third and goal you know and for the for the Eagles I mean they started out with that great first drive on both sides the touchdown and they got a stop on the three and out and then they got back there and they really slowed down they didn't they ran it on third and four dropped the shotgun snap they had some bad penalties in allowed that 9 yard run you need to score here or those boo birds will be coming out in a hurry working the tight ends at the top of the screen got both of them up top and Zach Kurt's going in motion that's a Matt checking mantoman coverage well sorry offense number 86 fiveyard penalty remains third down Zach just got aggressive there he was coming off that motion a lot of times are you coming off motion you know it's mantoman coverage you want to get running you want to use the motion to your advantage and outs he left way too early CIT Redskins played Zach Ertz and Alshon Jeffery at the bottom of the screen together Jeffery has two touches on third down here's a third and goal West just short was a galore your duck Peterson's gone pulled on fourth down more than anybody and then FL he's been aggressive since he's got here in 2016 I expect him to do the same right now yeah he didn't even look at the ticker he's look at this place she you see the Eagles numbers on fourth down since 2006 as I mentioned Doug Peterson that has been his signature interesting note wid they take Zach Ertz out of the game on this crucial fourth down we get the timeout used here now this game so critical you sit there and you think about where the skins were a couple of weeks ago and now the cowboys and what they've been doing defensively in the upset of the Saints and there are the tau boys at seven and five skins thought that six wins Plateau and the Eagles the comeback victory against the Giants and then the road ahead and you see where the opportunity lies with Philadelphia yeah be Philadelphia look at every make it win tonight and then next week they got Dallas and Dallas is redhot you know you look at how that defense is playing with those three young linebackers with Jaylon Smith and Van garresh they're getting healthy you know suspect Shawn Lee to get back tire and Smith Cowboys are rolling but the Eagles in a lot of ways and they can kind of flip the script with a win tonight and then next week against the Cowboys now the fourth and goal no Zach Ertz on the field it's Adams and he has taken down by Brown a tackle for loss on fourth and goal merav skis defense shuts them down you know tests sometimes you can get creative offensively but you got it blocked a guy you got a blood attack Brown coming off the short edge pretty easy tackle formative a sack ground with the big play nowhere to go the big moment for the Redskins as they have a threepoint lead keeping the Eagles from scoring their thanks to hit number 53 Zac Brown and right now give this Eagles defense you got to be ready to stop the run Peterson barely getting out of the end zone Brandon Graham let's take a look at Zac Brown Tony and this was the crucial warm down the Eagles don't even block him you got to think that there was a missed assignment or the running back Adams he's got it bounce it outside I know Doug Peterson is very creative but he's not that created to leave Zac Brown unplugged on a future for found the bug and there's nothing special about that call I mean I go forward in four things short no scheme up the play I'm okay with running the ball he's got to get on the perimeter the best thing about Washington defense is those front three yeah inside and they try to run right in the heart of it welcome back to the late Mark Sanchez as the ball is barely cresting out from beyond the goal line and this crowd here in Philly is roaring Sanchez not even close so Sanchez first pass attempt by the way with that pass attempt Sanchez now the second player to throw a pass for now three NFC East teams stun it with the Eagles Cowboys and now skims Rodney Peete the other and for Mark Sanchez it's run the football obviously when they're in backed up like this it's quick game bootlegs getting them outside the pocket and no but fumbles right here think about this last week the only new 15 plays so how many could he know this week 3035 the PlayBook is limited with Mark Sanchez and you got to think that if you're Jim Schwartz you know that you want to make sure you bring a lot of pressure and make him make quick decision on the play clock running down with that pressure situation utilizing the timeout the nice points of view is brought to you by CDW you know one of the things that makes parson winch incredible is his ability I don't need to drop that but since Tim plays and scramble and be Houdini and find gold and tape in the end zone last year his ability to do this and get the football down the field that's been the big difference flash in addition with this equals office if he can get it back this year there's still an opportunity for this team to make the postseason what an opportunity for once to get the ball right back with great field position his defense can come up with a stop here and now it's time for this front for the Eagles to heat it up they're built on defense up for Fletcher Cox Michael get it Chris long let's heat em up Sanchez going to keep it simple here with Davis who cuts back to the inside and reaches out to give them some breathing room to punch away now the Eagles just got to understand where they're at in the field and where they're at in this game we're gonna get the ball in good field position here before the half capitalize on it you know don't be concerned if you're gonna go for it and not take the points be aggressive with that approach press way is top 10 in the league in that average and see if you can turn one over here and drive it downfield schools going 46 to PMS and crosses midfield and dances his way that sideline 14 yard return it's just a great time of year the lights out you got Christmas carolers tears come on or for wit watching vince'll on holiday movies like wedding crashers Oh reciting Four Christmases last night at dinner that's right gonna keep this thing PG my favorite stuff after the goalline stand they get the ball back here before the twominute warning as they go with the straight of Clement blockers and crunchies in his direction goes to the outside and goes ahead for 11 yards and that's the aggressive play call you want from gut Petersen understand it's mantoman coverage get him running your receivers running crossing routes and then come back with a screen pass and the best thing about it getting their most athletic lineman out in space their Center Jason Kelsey with a big block Jupiter Sanchez at quarterback under that exclusive trailer Marvel Studios Captain Marvel also coming your way to the outside sex hate another black is down this at the 40yard line personal foul roughing the passer defense hundred thirtyseven his 15yard penalty will be added to the end of the play and an automatic first down that's tagged on strowman the rookie out of Virginia Tech yeah and Peter's trying to come back and get him he just got it the ball is out can't hit him in the back there Stroman that's the Redskins I just want to see them play with a little bit more detail in critical times in the game they have plays like that where they don't get a block God goes run unblocked inside the gap or on the edge there the penalty in Allegan how it's served right up for Philadelphia already inside the 15 here minute 54 before the half Scrolls in the backfield with Wes selfinflicted wounds you just have too many of them not watching defense and here is close look at Kelsey working down building schools spins his way into the end zone well earned by Jason Kelsey the center and welcome back Darren Sproles 14yard score you know test Darren Sproles is going to get a lot of the credit and deservedly so because when he comes back he brings juice but watch the center number 62 ko see first he pulls and then he gets up in the line backer Mason Foster and he rides him for about 12 jobs and his prose does the rest and then finds more work this is textbook and effort but it's it's how he does it I mean it goes around the guard he's like he's pulling he's not just going up field Kelsie's athletic getting to the second level schools does the rest remember he's a former power running back at University of Cincinnati was a walkon he still had that hard work ethic to this day firstteam allpro a year ago and paving the way for Darren Sproles and that's the creativity we talked about with this Eagles office you don't want to slam it up against the inside guys of deer on pain and Jonathan Allen allow your Center who's about to and 85 pounds and a great day to get outside and foes coming back from injury to find him to me nice execution nice play called by Doug Peterson Eagles retake the lead the goalline stand Washington offense goes nowhere forcing them to punt from the end zone field position penalty and then scrolls because he has been absent from this offense since week one but returned to practice this week stealing with a hamstring practices November 7th reminder that and now for Washington the challenge of playing quarterback and only been there two weeks only the communication now you're in a twominute potential situation and the signals getting in and out of the huddle if you do go out hurry up but not these surprised and they do that a little bit try to get a first down or two before you go into that because you got to communicate all that he's lucky to know what the play is yeah now that give the signals on the road with this pass rush that's a lot to ask quarterback that's been there less than two weeks McCoy leads the game injured Mark Sanchez the quarterback getting hits on the slant to Thaksin now you get into your twominute mode after the big catch Jim Schwartz played a little mantoman coverage on the outside surprised by that I make Mark Sanchez have to go the distance on me play zone keep it underneath and make him beat you Val hasn't thrown a touchdown pass in over three years week 12 2015 the last time Sanchez you while the heroes of last year's Super Bowl all but clinching the game with his strip sack of Tom Brady back then Graham just comes up and underneath he is going against Trent Williams he goes to the bully plays that inside and then comes back and when those off it's 11 linemen they get on different levels meaning they're not on the same side and then that cannot pass that off when the defensive and Brandon Graham comes back underneath filial used a timeout here with a minute 9 remaining you know if you're the Washington Redskin you counter caught in a conundrum you have really your third quarterback now in Mark Sanchez but in order to take advantage of this ego defense you want to attack this secondary they play last week without the top five corners and number six got hurt during the game so the weakness of this defense is on the back end so Mark Sanchez is gonna have to throw the football down the field wit whether it's mantoman or zone in my opinion move the ball we're gonna get an update as to the health of Colt McCoy at the half we just saw Jay Gruden get his call sheet then he had another piece of paper that's probably plays that he saw that said Mark Sanchez said these are the ones that I want to run these what I feel comfortable going so he goes from that big laminated menu you're talking about to probably at the index card way it has been looted second and 17 and this time as he goes to Jameson Crowder who well on that industry list is this guy who missed the last seven weeks with a sprained ankle and another timeout will be utilized by the Eagles here I hope to get another crack at it and third down coming up it'll be third in the seventh in a minute 11 remaining here in this first half first half that saw Philadelphia come down strike first with Golden Tate and Washington had the 90 car run by Petry and Peterson they had a 107 lead and Sproles moments ago with the touchdown irani and how aggressive do you get if you Jay Gruden it's 1410 Union third quarter back you got to feel pretty good about how you played you get really aggressive here what do you want a safe play punting and allow your defense to play to try to get in the half we're down in seven Sanchez as he goes to ruin with that body going back and leaning for it is right at that line to me Sullivan and Jenkins who are trying to keep up at Washington and Washington will use a timeout here well that was really good game manage budget by John Jay Gruden right there what happened was he gave a high percentage throws third and seven he wants to capitalize certainly he's trying to get the first down but the one thing he was doing was it's high percentage so you can catch it if you don't get the first you punt with Philadelphia having no more timeouts but shirt runs they have to go a long way you get the first down now you have two timeouts and you called it right away giving his team a chance now with DePaul at the 45 yard line and another timeout in his back pocket and notice where the throws are going all the throws are across the middle of the field for Mark Sanchez right in front of annoyed doesn't have to read and make the long rolls nice design there by Jay Putin also 32 year old who has signed on November 19th and needed somebody to back up court McCoy and here is Sanchez steps up in the pocket and gets a complete again as a Crowder 11 yards there and now Washington is in business now here is Sanchez work in the twominute offense his last touchdown pass inside the first half twominute warning came in week six of 2012 2012 Sanchez little chapeau Paulson out of bounds goes Crowder for five more yards so Sanchez has them on the go and Sanchez doing a good job here he's stepping up inside the pocket he understands where he's gonna do crossing routes boarding that rush textbook and now he doesn't need to do too much right you you would obviously like to have a touchdown in this area but don't try to come in and be a hero here don't force the ball don't take sacks just keep managing it just like he's going yeah just step in and go six of seven first 62 yards and put your team in position here for 34 seconds to go I'd be time for the egos to heat him up he looks a little too comfortable back there second and five he's going to take a shot to the endzone the outstretched arms of dachshund yeah Datsun oneonone on the outside off coverage there and try to close on it link it on the outside before he goes to that outside he gets on the edge Sanchez just overthrew it a little bit like putting this tacit that wide receiver just stack it up there dachshund before you capitalize on it now it wouldn't be some project the Eagles maybe but a little pressure try to knock the radians out a field goal range here thirtyfive tried to quickly get it out Malley escapes Wallace and it is complete Michael Floyd came in and broke up what could have been an interception as Nigel Bradham was quick to get on Sanchez at the end of that we just can't do that they're actually trying to fake the little quick rocket screen and try to steal one up the scene there and just once he extended he got lucky I think intercepted but Floyd almost had it you know it's kind of what happens guy would like when you don't play a lot your internal clock does it run fast enough it doesn't speed up and I think Marx and she has got caught there Hopkins hit from 44 earlier this from 47 good job by Mark Sanchez to put them in position and Hopkins poses it to a onepoint game now the NFC playoff picture obviously we're focused in on the NFC East here the Cowboys and what that defense has been able to do huge win against the Saints and then Seattle don't look now but there's Seattle coming on strong had a big Road win and Tomales an Francisco yesterday and we're gonna have a critical game with Seattle and Minnesota next week on Monday Night Football Vikes went east to Foxborough they now sit at six five and one in Seattle in position to really do something down the stretch here of course the Chiefs await in a couple weeks but 49ers and Cardinals struggling this year and then that big game and the NFC playoff picture with the Vikings next week yeah that's gonna be old school football I mean Seattle's running the ball better than anybody in the National Football League and guess what kind of defense they didn't play well last night Minnesota up and you know against going against New England they struggled a little bit but the last four or five weeks that Mike Zimmer defense for Minnesota has been topnotch oh and congratulations to Tom Brady on 1,000 career rushing yards it's amazing what can be done over a nineteenyear expand and we'll get you that update as to what's going on with Colt McCoy this guy here Carson Wentz 159 passing yards in the first half had the touchdown passed a Golden Tate to start our scoring tonight and what more could you want I mean NSE East rivals onepoint game playoff hopes are on the line you take a knee here we're gonna go in at 1413 touchdown for Washington was the 90 yarder by Adrian Peterson the oldest player NFL history with a 90 plus yard touchdown run also the first player with a 90yard rush against the Eagles in history the Redskins are going to get the ball to start the second half Zach Ertz is chasing witness history as we're gonna join Suzy Kolber for the genesis halftime show starting right now the night of the record you speak of is your alltime mark of a hundred and ten catches in a single season for a tight ends he is actually just two catches now away from breaking a single season Eagles record of 19 catches was Brian Westbrook who set that in 2007 check in with Lisa well it's horrible news for Colt McCoy results of those xrays showed a fractured right fibula his season is now over so disappointing for him because when we met with him last night at the team hotel he actually got kind of emotional talking about how much he was looking forward to this opportunity he said he waited for so long and was so excited about the chance to show that he could still play in this league and now that chance has been taken away from him I asked Jay Gruden about he said just heartbreaking he said we worked so hard with both Alex nip and Colt McCoy Boca those guys go down he said we still gotta play but it's devastating Lisa you captured that well he was getting emotional last night talking about you know nine years in the league had the opportunity early on in his NFL career with the Browns 13 starts there and then five years now in the system with Jay Prue they have a very close relationship and he felt confident to step up in this moment down the stretch with the playoff picture shaping up and replacing Alex Smith and now we get word of the fractured leg and as a backup quarterback that's the only thing you hope for he said he had been on a team this good in his career know they were six and four going into it he had a chance and his heart breaking for him he's a true Pro they Sanchez Peterson and Trust reversed course and finally is taken down by till another injury news by the way Jonathan Cooper former teammate of yours with who was playing left guard without already out the starting left guard he is out injured as well in gaad's one more thing on Colt McCoy think about this when he had hurt his ankle he actually came back and played a couple more plays and just shows you how he tried to fight through to be out down the team on the field for his team and this is what Washington wanted to avoid for Mark Sanchez third and 11 coming out and a half it's not the start got to protect it and then allow these do not as receivers are doing with the run out to catch third and 11 for Sanchez Sanchez nearly tripped up gets it down field and on the sidelines looking to find dachshund as they're talking this over there st. incomplete Lag is also down back at the 31yard line you see dices world incomplete an eligible member of the offense downfield part of the past number 69 is penalty be declined results of the play will be fourth down that's what happens when the quarterback extends sometimes as such was the case there and by the way this Redskins offense now they struggle on these first drives of second halves haven't scored a touchdown in the first drive of second half now in the last 24 games that is the longest streak in the NFL and Sproles is back deep for the Eagles he falls for the fair catch at about the 24 Zach Ertz glad to have him wearing that Monday night Mike tonight big bucks ah put a stamp on this game you know just recognizing good block love your brother talk to Carson earlier about trust it's really stepping up as a leader to for this football team as the other young leader when says he quickly gets it to Apple or who tried to turn the corner as taken down by the veteran judge Norman you know Norman's always willing to talk a little bit number where we had Monday Night Football down there in New Orleans Norman was benched for a series in that game week five reportedly was wearing headphones while Jay Gruden was speaking to the team at halftime don't want to do that one and I think more than anything else it's just he hasn't played as well as they expected him to this year you know he's getting up playing press mantoman he's got to challenge these guys in this defense second five now look at that edge well with good convoy of blockers including Kelsey and say omalo just run the wide zone they're gonna get them on the edge here and blocking this and when they do that it just they don't want to run on the inside with a strength of this Washington defense so kidding on the pointman tour making these guys but inside line the sidelines is important for this really offense nice block by the rookie tight end Goddard and they don't even block the middle linebacker Mason Foster because they're saying our back can get to the corner before Foster can just taking advantage of foster not being an elite speed guy and if he does run there comes the RPO in behind the boys there's one son first down easy pitch and catch the golden tape her tape had the touchdown earlier tonight this goes for 13 yards went so relaxed well he's gonna really get on the edge there with his mobility got it with another big block on Carrigan he's very accurate outside of the pocket that's one of the things he does and I think he doesn't want to take those hits and running the football that's a priority for Doug Peterson in Carson Wentz but this is what he does best is extending these plays and then playing quarterback from outside the pocket now you got urge going on brown on the outside we've been highlighting matchup against linebackers and then speeds ahead and is wrestled down for 10 yards there and that was against Zac Brown and add to his total well that's just pitching catch I mean you know he's got the bib on when he's goes there he's slobbering on that one Zac Brown that's a matchup Zac's a good linebacker inside but putting him out in space making him cover hurts split out and just look how much versatility Zach Ertz has being inside it's a traditional tight in and then doing it on the edge as a receiver able to fill that ball off the ground and tackle for a loss was Adams you had that relationship with Tony Romo the quarterback tight end relationship and you can see what's brand and you know to go through life and as a football player and having that quarterback and what happens is you shared stories you taxed hey what do you think about that look that coverage when you work at your craft and that's what these two are doing second 14 crossing over as a galore solicit into more with Zach Ertz well I think when you think about that with him he's just incredible player and how he does it because he's so unique cars cars Aaron calling out to Carson there's out in nine shaking three is tape fold and tape dragging Dick's with them down to the 5yard line you know the risk is pretty little pressure they're trying to force the issue playing a little oneonone on the outside you got the rookie Stroman mantoman against eight he misses the tackle and now taint who's a physical runner loves to run after the catch he's he'll eat at debt and he can get his done especially when he gets oneonone in the open field first and goal Golden Tate finding himself here and that he goes uniform after coming over with the trade with the Lions for a thirdround pick first and goal by Josh Norman and still on his feet returned from the end zone for Josh Norman his third pick of the year big moment just when they needed it wets peck dog no Carson Wentz just got picked off by the runnerup of Dancing with the Stars big moment / Josh Norman he went dancing didn't he yeah well it does cook mantoman coverage he jumps underneath it the ball should have gone outside with the cover one the whole player Mason foster gets to Josh Norman credit playing underneath seeing the ball make a difference making the play in the red zone with that hurt said interception Josh Norman he does have a unique ball skills that's what type of player he is he's antsy he's aggressive and you shell there you really jump that one underneath fourth red zone turnover this season for the Eagles keeping it simple now first Sanchez as the ghost of Jordan Reed yeah you just gotta love Josh Norman hanging in there he started the season not even being there best corner that was Quinn Dunbar he took that over but Norman has kind of hung in there and got better and better and he's doing things that he may not be comfortable with he's an off corner he comes to watch the quarterback and play in that zone they're asking him to put a little bit more mantoman press physical nice job there on Jeffery now this is getting even worse for the Redskins is 20 bergstrom it was the starting right guard who's filling in for Brandon Sheriff the twotime Pro Bowler who's on IR with a torn PEC he is being attended to by the medical staff now keep in mind Jonathan Cooper left the game injured as well that's the other guard who was a backup to a foul the starter never decimated on the interior that offensive line watch big 66 Hunter coming down on the back of his leg hook you might have to strap it up you'd be a good white zone right push down to skinny now they can't afford go Peterson done a jump cut and then surging ahead for three yards and right to that step but if you're Washington yes a lot of people are injured but this is how you have to play this game coming down the stretch run the football with agent Peterson shortening game keep the clock moving because right now you're the disadvantage mark said she has only knows a handful of plays so you're gonna have to make sure that he's comfortable in the place that you're calling and shorten the game and play to your defense Harris Daniel Snyder owner of the Redskins Bruce Allen the team president they watch on with notes Sanchez playing quarterback now pretty did it as Jameson Crowder is tackled by LeBlanc he talked about the limited exposure to playbook get an execution in practice time how about that that was just like the Bad News Bears there he's going to flip it I don't know what was going on hey he's fortunate just to get away with that I don't think your time to emotion for Crowder obviously I think the only guy that could give the better analysis would be the belt men across the street who saw you yesterday when you got to Philadelphia what'd that guy say to you it took he screamed and I said hey wit and I thought think I had a Cowboys fan up here or something he said you suck welcome to Philly you suck second and 15 well pulsar offense number 76 five yard penalty remains second down you know though tests and you come in here as a young player on the road I mean it starts on the bus ride you know eggs are getting hitting the hood the bus you look out the window there's a 90 year old grandma white hair she's giving the double birds the fans are screaming at you but uh I tell you what I most bellman in Philly wit now yeah go watch yourself in this town these fans love me compared to what's going on in Twitter right now and Philly fans hate me they've hated me for a long time second 220 Sanchez once again just goes underneath to read of course you had some moments here that got their attention like this back in 2007 helmet comes off wit you keep your balance I don't just get me out there and scat right pump three seven zero love that call my favorite playoff the Y option here's what I'd love to know how'd you happen come off so easy those except that they got bad boy third and 13 Vito's fans look at her stop against Mark Sanchez and the skins mr. 408 again with Thompson the bank deal just goes for six there and it's just smart by the ego defense you got upper end Davis what imagine you had a quarterback that doesn't know all the offense is starting long you drop back play coverage what a football underneath and now if you're Carson Wentz in this Eagle office you got to get someone you can't let the Redskins hang around and they're decimated with injury and on that third quarterback Reston's fifth time third and ten are longer and they're old from five tonight when you're making me laugh at the end of that classic play here in Philly I miss it this may be one like Wilma chango's opponent ones leg on Saturday night on the passes for guard and look at you there blood coming out of those tough guy 82 ESPN's Monday Night Football is brought to you by Walmart light of Christmas at Walmart a beautiful night here with our aerial coverage brought to you by Goodyear mild temperatures in Philly early December 1413 lead for the Eagles here in the third here's the running back to his board at North Philly chops as he's able to get to the outside the rookie out of Notre Dame who's been coming on as the years move along 18 euros well good good patience on this when his tight ends gonna come back across and make that block and it allows that to happen and then he gets on the outside look you know there's a bull chance playing against his third string quarterback and Sanchez beat up off into line his selfinflicted wounds of what hurt him there with it getting stuffed in the fourth and 1 and then the interception one of the wrong guy down in the red zone they got to get to drive back going with playaction and control on the line of scrimmage play action for wets NASA said complete Josh Adams we told you he's a local guy he's born premature six weeks premature premature moved out to the suburbs at age four to Warrington and hernia surgery dealt with asthma as a child this is a guy who used to do cartwheels they said when he was called to answer a question in class great personality and then started Central Bucks South High School it's about 30 miles away from here at Lincoln Financial Field had great year at Notre Dame and then there was a foot fracture that was found in the predraft medicals and then stock tumble went undrafted and now he's been good undrafted free agent rookie for the Eagles as they doubled the strain of product weaving his way past one two three yards there watch Jason Kelsey on this screen pass though he's going to be the sinner and he's going to get out on this screen pass after they go like they're gonna run the bootleg to a galore come back out and Kelsey gettin in space making the Pitt block on the edge lineman that can run that's the key to your screen game let's hooks up again with Burt's Kelcey we talked about him he's been a key factor tonight on the screenplay earlier getting on Foster's staying on blocks you know how hard that is to be climb and not knowing where the ball hits and then running the draw pulling around athletic sinner where to find guys that can climb up on that second level and have the athleticism so good we'll make those blocks and then go on to where lime green plumbers constantly the outrageous scenes in the Super Bowl parade from Jason Kelsey and he's one of the smaller sinners in the league only about 285 guys I think we got to consider that when whit goes in the camp wouldn't go check out that cost how about and that'll do of the chains setup the fact that he was going after the singleseason Eagles record and now at 92 receptions there it is the alltime singleseason mark in Philadelphia Eagles history 92 catches this year for Zach Ertz you know we talk a lot about Kelsey Gronkowski I think it's time to put her in that same conversation among the best ideas the National Football League Wes incomplete that time I was looking for a very goodlooking tight end prospect in the rookie Goddard and then of course the next conversation becomes the alltime singleseason record by a tight end jason has that of a hundred ten benches but the time I mean a month to play for Zach Ertz sitting at 92 now but the barbecue sauce that you put on that 2012 season so the Cheez Whiz is popular with the Philly cheesesteaks here was Zach Ertz scrolls it was split and sprint and get himself to the 26 before Brown and Moreau were able to find him no arch is gonna break that record now his focus now is on getting his team in the postseason and he needs to do is just one possession here he's got to keep making those plays you saw him come out on that previous play and Goddard falls down running the same route and take a quick injury timeout here baby Murrow was the injured Redskins player Sybil to walk off the field taking a look at him here's what happened at the end of that players just use act Brown coming in Tess we call that friendly fire when you know God hits you like that so Danny Johnson the rookie of the Southern will step in and lock down that corner spot to the near side here on third and five for the Eagles Scrolls in the backfield with Wentz time to find out shot Jeffrey for a first down and Washington they gotta pick that up I mean it's the playing zone coverage so they pass it off and Zac Brown and foster there the linebackers they're gonna pick it up it's right there it's the drag route that's a critical third down can hold him to three just got to make that play but wit it's a weakness of this Washington Redskins defense the middle linebackers Brown and foster they have limited athletic ability and limit awareness and pass coverage and it showed them all three of Jeffrey's coach listen from the third downs to convert them to a fresh set of downs Adams's reverses course and then they're able to come up and find him that was brett strowman can they solve some of these red zone struggles tonight Peterson falls it in here final seconds ticking down in this third quarter tenth play of this Drive for filler as we hit double zeros look at the margin when we start the fourth bills this coming weekend how about that army team this year nine and two College GameDay recent guys will be at Army Navy oh he's one of the best shows of the year Clement is leaving his way of 14 yards start this fourth quarter here in Philly for NFC playoff position it's just another screen passing at Lane Johnson and Jason Kelsey I'll put the linebackers rating space for him and get in the first down and now they need to finish we're in the red zone they've been brutal than the red zone tonight with how they played the turnover and getting stopped on the fourth and one they need to capitalize here first and goal and they found a little separation on those pesky washington team whence looks left on the sweat into the enzone Jordan Matthews framed up against the rookie DeeDee Johnson and he got the best of them well what they do is they get a pic route so a galore is gonna go up in Matthew just gonna come right underneath it and when you do that good job by a galore understanding Matthews with the patient's an accurate throw like Carson wins you keep that offense on the field with it already being a sevenpoint margin are going to choose to go for two here try to make this thing a ninepoint game whence spread right and reaching down and corralling it and going in is tape that's what entir I mean he is so good at those situations making tough catches at the critical time and making a twopossession game now there's the leadership of the Redskins owner Daniel Snyder team president Bruce Allen their team trailing by nine here in the fourth quarter they've got a lot to deal with recently major news on Sunday November 25th San Francisco 49ers released the off trouble linebacker Rubin Foster that was the day after his recent arrest at their team hotel and tampon one count of misdemeanor domestic violence battery last Tuesday the Redskins then claimed Foster they were the only NFL team to put in a waiver claim now NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell placed foster on his exempt list meaning he cannot practice for play while under investigation our production team was able to speak to the Washington Redskins president Bruce Allen who you just saw there and we talked in very directly about that claim of Foster Sanchez goes the Floyd and considering that conversation let's bring in Lisa who has more tests while our question was why take the risk on a player who has so much baggage and Bruce Allen said that the team they really did their own investigating into the alleged incident that Bruce Alvin he has a lot of contacts down in Tampa remember he was a GM there from 2004 to 2008 he said after Washington gathered its own information they felt comfortable that they had heard a side of the foster story that is different I asked Aaron can whatever great play he might bring to your team outweigh to that year he said we'll have to see what happens well I want to bring booger and Jason into this conversation here so the Redskins willing to take a chance on Reuben Foster should they have causes and you know young players just have to understand there's no tolerance for putting your hands on a woman period now Jason you've been very open through the years and I'm a winner of the NFL man of the year for what you have done in your life and there are a few men as well human I've ever known in my life who are more impact and life disrupted by the impact of domestic violence in your childhood so we appreciate that I know it comes from a very highly educated place on the subject matter also comes with a lot of emotion from you Boog I completely agree with you with they're under no circumstances should you ever put your hand on a woman whatsoever and I think the NFL needs a more stringent policy make the punishment whoa make it something that if it does come up that the NFL will punish you so bad that you don't want to be involved in it anymore I think that's the only way you're gonna be able to get rid of this so Nathan Gary the interception of Mark Sanchez and Philadelphia I'm looking to put this game away my cleats you know guys you see that right there at the cleats just falling up from our story you know what we were talking about earlier I mean there are a lot of guys and then I felt that are doing a lot of good I was in that locker room for 15 years just coming off of it and I should go on to notice but guys have to understand the platform the responsibility in society so after the interception by Nathan Gary I'll start off at the 35 yard line here and a play flicker to do so and it goes incomplete as they had coverage on Jeffrey you know we had that discussion about Reuben foster obviously in the wake of the news surrounding Kareem hunt and book you brought up the NFL and you know under fire at times with the handling of domestic violence but let's advance it to what can be done to help curb the fundamental problem with of domestic violence involving NFL players well I think you know there's a NFL takes a lot of criticism but I do know that they're working to educate to provide aroundtheclock services for these guys to to understand that you know what whatever you experience in your life you now have a chance to change that in that you know I think guys have to understand that you know what we're seeing around the league that there's no tolerance for it there cannot be it has to be unwavering and I just think it sent the wrong message when the Redskins claimed Rueben foster because you know and I said I understand that it's ongoing but you know this isn't his first time with this happening you know we talk about domestic violence in the NFL like it's an NFL problem it's not it's a societal problem and if the NFL really wants to do away with it in their league they're gonna have to figure out a way to make the punishment a lot tougher that way the rescues or any other team won't feel comfortable and take wrists and because they feel comfortable that they know what happened in the situation down in Tampa that they're willing to do that and take that risk because of that comfort ability of maybe getting a player on the back end that's the only way you're gonna get rid of it but it's not just in that fail problem guys it's a societal problem and I think Roger the deal and every one of three at 3:45 Park Avenue have to make the policy and their punishment a lot tougher well said gentlemen it is an incomplete pass on third down so on comes Jake Elliott only five nine but he's got textbook technique and he's been so repeatable for the Eagles this a 46yard attempt the turtle who turns into a quick grade 25 to 13 filler the Salters the Eagles started this fourth quarter which is two point lead and now the touchdown from Matthews the field goal from Elliot and in control there well is something that happened last night with the Steelers and the Chargers that big comeback so this is how the AFC playoff picture looks right now that Chargers teams sitting there at nine and three in striking distance of the Chiefs and consider the remaining schedule and they're playing with such confidence with Philip Rivers the guys and now there it is in week 15 at the Chiefs the Bengals team that's been struggling a bit tough game against the Ravens and Broncos with that defense that's been coming on in week 17 who knows so the Chargers the team that or they should be paying attention to and Philip Rivers another veteran quarterback plans him that his best football his slate was career comes out he falls back on it you know as it pertains to the charges guys I think they're one of the more complete teams in the National Football League offensively we're rivers and Gordon and Alan defensively boast of coming back getting healthy last night against the steel if they had a punt return for a touchdown so we were all enamored by patch of mahomes and we talked about Tom Brady wide as his kilt one of the more complete teams in the National Football League out of Los Angeles charges at 73 yarder by King was sensational that punt return that year reference Alan had 148 yards receiving that was a thrilling comeback win yeah down 16 at the half at Pittsburgh looks like sports gonna bring a look fresh to Sanchez recognized a call timeout Mark Sanchez will use the timeout trailing by 12 here just under 11 minutes to play for just joining us obviously you know what half of Alex Smith couple weeks ago the broken leg and then Colt McCoy suffers a fractured fibula in our first half so Mark Sanchez who was signed on November 19th pressed into action you know and Mark came to Dallas after Tony got hurt and was the backup for dak Prescott in 2016 and so I watched him come in here to learn that playbook on no kind of short week he never got thrown in there but he's a veteran player and he's been thrown to the fire you know and so he's had some adversity and right now you know this Redskins football team they need him to make a play problem is they don't have a big weapon on the outside so groaning Davis Jordan Rini they're gonna have to carry him across the middle and get a few first downs Davis bottom in your screen read split number three receiver fair as that's where he looked but he threw it to the inside on second and fourteen trying to get it to Jordan Reed and just to cover two sorts of linebacker and that's just where they don't have that chemistry yet Reid broke out Sanchez expecting him to turn inside and it's you know it's quick throws when they're in those plays and now now you're sitting in there in third law and that just goes back to an experience that what's Kelsey doing up in the stands is everywhere third down a year up by 11 as a defensive lineman guys this is my dream right here so if you're Cox you're wrong you're Graham this is what you dream about right now about Graham nine technique in the four point stance but they go the other way and quickly get it out to read who throws it back on the lateral Chris Thompson just tripped up though that time as Douglas smartly stayed at home that's where you got a do go I mean Jay Gruden's trying to pull them all out and how deep into bag is he going with it on surprise Douglas just throw the quick screen no Jordan reads the emergency quarterback with the floor to play little quarterback tell you what Trent Williams almost got that block he would have been gone this was tripped up nickels 15 Eastern Suzy in the game we'll have Monday night countdown at 6:00 Eastern from out in Seattle Mike's loss to the Patriots yesterday and there is Seattle at 7 and 5 Josh Adams going to test that left side not finding much there except for Preston Smith waiting on them you know but one thing they found with Josh Adams is a guy that can be a physical runner inside we forget last year LeGarrette Blount Jay Ajayi guys that they had that they could run their football and when you talked about it earlier they want to get the RPO game the stretch game to play action well the only way to play action word guys if you can run the football and so Adams gives them that added element that they were missing earlier in the season was the jaw he got hurt trying out for the season an ACL tear he's week five that happened and I'm so steppedup second date whence comes near side and tape stays his way and dances just beyond haha putting dicks size things up with the Eagles I get the 12 point lead here next week the game against Dallas yeah I mean look Dallas is really hot but they go and win tonight they got a chance against Dallas to get themselves back into it so we just talked about the Vikings Seahawks game next week that's all gonna impact the Eagles wild heart card or potentially than winning the division so they can still control it it's just what's the formula what's different than last year tonight at times they've done it but too many selfinflicted wounds at critical times they're down in one as once it got a pass up but what exact earths and whence connecting it looks pretty easy doesn't you know talking to Doug Peterson before the game the one thing he said it was that these two weeks are going to kind of make a break their season tonight and then next week at Dallas you see went on a little roll out a little picker out there Aguila set to pick close to winters favorite guy in the world Zach Ertz and then that's stealing right there but that's the formula for the Eagles team allowed Carson Wentz to manipulate the pocket get outside but they're gonna have to get somebody else involved besides a Kurds with Adams flag rains in as he crosses midfield holding defense number 93 this fiveyear penalty will be added to the end of the play first now you know bug you said that about Zach Ertz and just every great tight end will have somebody on the outside well you cannot be a good tight end I experienced it with out a top wide receiver on the outside and you think about the other guys of you know Kelsey and and who he has an Tyree kill and you think of Gronkowski and Julian Edelman and so for Travis Kelce I think that's why they brought Golden Tate here to try and do it by committee and tonight it's really kind of his golden Tate's comingout party here in Philadelphia he's been targeted six times has had six receptions the touchdown 279 yards of offense and it's gonna add to it a bit here and that's how they want to use him the quick gaming little quick screens intermediate routes and then you Jeffrey for those big throws because he's that kind of the 50/50 target that's who they want to go to on the outside and then a galore is in the slide he's got good speed coming into his own here the last couple years you know I just think they have to stretch to feel open they offense up a little bit more Carson Wentz is not running as much this year and I understand it and probably rightfully so because of the knee so what are they gonna have to do it it's not the manufacture offense pulling the football down their fuel I don't think you can deep and dump your way to the playoffs in this division here's Adams against a little hesitation been engaging and getting inside the 30 and another first down for Philadelphia the money we had that 90yard touchdown run by Adrian Peterson earlier today and maybe there was some hope for the Redskins but since then they've had 25 plays for only 82 yards and meanwhile the Eagles offense little by little finding momentum especially here in this fourth quarter they've had 41 plays since that big run by Peterson for three hundred or two yards as a head for three that time little something extra to Mason Foster and Zac Earth's and now you know God we talk a lot about this egos team and where they're going what about the other side in the Redskin you know Jay Gruden he's had a couple of years when the players his primary players have been injured this year they've been decimated the offensive line now two quarterbacks I just wonder and I hope they give Jay Gruden enough time we can get a healthy roster to see really what this fool roster can be for him because right now it's not looking good and the injuries are playing a huge he fought it all the injuries and it is a tidal wave of injuries for Washington this season Smallwood comes in as the running back on second and seven as they show Jeff motion and come back and try to set up the tight end screen and Dallas Goddard for rookie on a South Dakota State and think about that boat to your point one playoff appearance in five years right for Jay Gruden and then on the on the flip side of it Mike McCarthy gets fired yesterday and he took him nine post seasons in 11 seasons so I mean that just tells you just how different organizations go about it I was so surprised to see Mike McCarthy get let go but what did you think of the timing of a Super Bowl winning coach being fired in season I didn't like it you know I mean he's done so much it's his second losing season so far you know in 12 years it's incredible what he's done winning a Super Bowl title 37 we're just gonna burn it look what was you're taking one that went down in Green Bay well it says here's the thing I'll say there's never wrong time to do the right thing and I think it was the right time to fire Mike McCarthy if you look at the relationship between he and Aaron Rodgers let's just go back to the Buffalo game after the game when they won where Aaron Rodgers questions that play called it but who's calling the plays who's in charge of the offense is Mike McCarthy so that's an offense and that's a relationship that has been toxic and so in my opinion the Packers made the right decision it's never a wrong time guys to do the right thing it was time for Mike McCarthy to go you gotta give him a chance to finish out the year I mean for what he's brought to that organization 24yard attempt from Elliot goes through and now it's 28 to 13 but here but here's the thing I would say wit if you know what the inevitability is going to be at the end why would you allow him to hang around and that's why I think it was the right time you know for him if you're Mike McArthur you probably got to get another job there are a lot of young quarterbacks out there that can use a veteran coach and some of the tunas that he gave Aaron Rodgers so I agree maybe it's a bad timing situation but if you know it's coming go ahead and get rid of you know that's interesting point you bring out that you think we're gonna have that you know McCarthy gets another job I don't know that this is a great year to be on the open market with coaches means some of these precocious coordinators are they quite seasoned enough yet year some of the names out there I mean Chris Rashard defense Gordon Eric Cowboys all of a sudden looking like somebody people may be interested and yet the defensive coordinators getting into I think offensive coaches it's just it's such an important role you know that that's where this kind of leaks going and some of that's college guys but Christmas short if anybody watched that game on Thursday night going against that powerful Saints offense he's a name that's gonna get a lot of attention he's got that heat Carroll pedigree was with Seattle Marinelli turned things over to him month plus ago in terms of the defensive play calling and that defense has been masterful that is the defense that Philadelphia will see next week there's been other names their job de Filippo is a coordinator who's had some promise in the course of the past year that people have been talking about then some of the college coaches and that's where the game is really been going to somebody to college offenses and highoctane stuff we've been seeing and test out throw another name by police what about Jim Caldwell a guy who was pretty successful he's an offensive guy and so I think as we move toward the offensive market and guys like Lincoln Riley and Davis shot all these guys names are going to come up I think it's important to make sure you just get the right guy and so for the Packers they've made a decision and now they can start their process along with the Cleveland Browns speaking and getting on the open market the Redskins are gonna have to figure things out at quarterback Sanchez is the lone man standing right now and he was just signed a few weeks ago as he was trying to connect with Chris Thompson so Alex Smith gets injured back on November 18th and this was the group that worked out the free agents that they were taken a look at they went with Sanchez because there was you know some overlap with the coaching staff guys who are with the Jets when Sanchez were there memory was the number 5 overall pick back to 2009 thought that he'd be familiar a bit with the basic construct of the offense McCoy Colt McCoy played against Dallas started tonight but he fractured his right leg tonight circumstances that we saw in the first half and you got it I mean you're looking at that list I mean it's hard to think one of those guys and then come in and help you you know get into the postseason so I mean that's the whole dilemma going back to training camp of you know I mean do you keep three quarterbacks when you're doing that and you know how all that plays out that used to be a big deal now you're not seeing as much but who would expect that these injuries I just feel bad for Colt McCoy and you know Jay Gruden's going to regroup as we said he's dealt with the injured bug a lot and gotta figure ways out ways to make it easy for a quarterback 37 Sancho's takes a deep drop event and guides ahead for the first down you know one thing on the veteran quarterback since they are still in the playoff hunt you know maybe that entices one of these retired guys potentially to come out and say hey you know I want to give it a shot and yeah maybe not behind this offensive line with both guards being hurt at the beginning of this season and then two more tonight yeah it has worked the offensive line tonight yeah number 91 Fletcher Cox and start their feast right now like this is a defensive line with dream your 15 points it's the fourth quarter how many sacks do I have let me see if I can add to that tonight all we're thinking about right now is sacks hey I loved when we visited with Fletcher Cox the other day because obviously what you were going up against him for years is it he's just he's so nice now but then he gets out on that field I don't mean flips that switch he did the switch you know that press gotten him went to school together you know he just start talking all the time you know I don't know he just went on another level I mean this guy's just something else I was so surprised cuz I heard he's all his nice guys a heck of a football player and he would not stop talking my fault submit trashed oh yeah yeah he was he was not gonna be my heart no offense number 76 5 yard penalty remains second down that would have to be in the SP payperview if we did the Monday night way Fletcher Cox he's a heck of a player though Eagles team captain got that big six year extension a few years at fourth most guaranteed money for a defensive player in the league Fletcher Cox and test think about this he feels like he's underrated because when we talk about the best defensive tackles in the game we stop and start with Aaron Donna he doesn't get mentioned he's up he doesn't get mentioned he's up there in the same category he's a top five defensive tackle the National Football League when you look at guys like Donald K Wan short but let's compare their and Donald and Donald a speed guy he gets off the air and he hits the gap quick he's about 6 1 about toward 80pound you compare deflection Cox is 6 for 3 10 he's Country Strong he pushes the pocket and he plays with power to different players but they're both top 5 defensive tackles in football I got to tell you Fletch I'm telling you tonight baby you're right up there in the same category as mr. Aaron down on Caitlin short and key no athletes hey vogue I want to have a quick errand Donna love conversation with you here after this third and 13 because what I'm seeing out of him right now is just on a different plane right now it flag comes in 16 and a half sex I know that we have a year offense fiveyard penalty remains third down we have a year with so many incredible MVP candidates everywhere you look on offense the quarterbacks curly everything was seen but this year that Aaron Donnell is having and what he's doing to disrupt opposing offenses with the 16 and a half sacks the four first fumbles he is everywhere all the time in the in the backfield and he's doing that as an interior defensive lineman on a team that may be the number one seed in the NFC he's getting exactly he's getting doubleteamed 70% of time tests and so I think when you start talking about the MVP he's definitely the Defensive Player of the Year and it's it's multiple fouls on the play against the offense holding offense number 71 this has been declined illegal use of the hands hands in the face offense number 79 this has been declined result to the play creates fourth down it's very rare that we stretched the conversation of AP to that place of a defensive player you think back to you know like an Allen page in the early 70s obviously Warren stand where in 86 is all time but let's see how the stretch run of this season goes and if Aaron Donald keeps up this pace because he is sublimely talented his ways on to punks and Scrolls back to the turn my Eagles fans have been wrong throughout this fourth quarter total replay is brought to you by DXL I was ready to play the second half for them the Eagles to run the pick route Agra Lord sets it Matthews has the patience to come under it and the pick route happens naturally and wins accurate throw in the red zone learn from it earlier when he missed on it Josh Norman intercepted him and he responded like a veteran once it's going over 300 yards got to a couple of touchdowns the Eagles are going to be coasting their way to a six and six mark with that showdown coming up in Dallas may have protected him well he has dropped back 39 times tonight and they haven't allowed a sack it's Clinton dicks with the tackle of Adams you know a lot of people talk about what's the winning formula and for the Eagles what's different this is that formula for them this is exactly it when the time of possession be good early and then stop they're off it's a running an attack with your defensive line they're number one in the league in rush defense they're in a lot of times last year so that's the formula for this Eagles football team well let me add to the formula how about stay healthy because Jason Peters the ninetime Pro Bowler is now limping off the field he's been dealing with injuries this year and it was this game in fact the Monday Night Football game at home over Washington that win when he was injured last year as you look at the top of your screen there he got caught up with Jason Kelsey remember he had the ACL in the MCL he was carted off the field was an emotional scene in the Monday nighter against Washington last year here and he's got to be frustrating for him here's a guy who was a tidy in at college test and now he's a Hall of Fame tackle and the injury bug is just starting to bite him at the end of his career you can tell the frustration I'm looking at his face right now just so frustrating for him and the torn biceps this year you can see the frustration as he limps off here as we are working our way towards the twominute warning and so critical to their success you know I believe they'll see on the Washington side and Trent Williams we have the best left tackle in football when he healthy right now Jason Peters in my opinion was that for a long long time and he'll be a halloffamer just wishing well to add interviews career to morning when we started this fourth quarter it was just a onepoint margin with the Eagles and stretched this thing out 28 to 13 good night out of Carson West over 300 yards passing two touchdowns targeted Zach Ertz 10 times tonight nine receptions for 83 yards central piece that guy's offense Doug Peterson the Super Bowl championship winning head coach who so many doubted than he hemmed the book has met more fearless how an underdog becomes a champion came out this year is and a good run and I think that's what you know when you Berger was referencing on when they win a Super Bowl then everybody starts doing all these other thing they get pulled in different directions this team hasn't won two games in a row all year four five and six now they have it in front of them got the Redskins tonight win that one now they're gonna have plate go down and play the Cowboys who are rolling they're hot so they got to regroup and that's the formula for them Carson Wentz is getting comfortable he's in command yet it wasn't perfect if the defense can come on they got a real shot at this thing but Doug Peterson finally rallying his team back in and saying hey it's time to hunker down if you want to compete in this division EIT Jeff for a book review there because Peterson was so impressed that you actually read his book this offseason yeah you know he's a humble guy I did read his book I think he's a he's a sharp guy I like how he approached it you know as a young coach he wasn't ready early on he learned her in the Andy read and it was a unique opportunity for him and a lot of people did question it and it hasn't been perfect for him early and I tell you what though he had a heck of a Superbowl on that run with that football team and his backup quarterback and he is a fearless coach you know and I think that's the biggest issue you know when you win the Super Bowl you have 53 guys that you bring together as a team and then you split apart and now we become individuals again and the toughest part for that coach is to get those individuals to buy back in as a team really good win the night for the Eagles now can they be consistent can they go to Dallas and be consistent with the healthy Carson wins against the hot Cowboys defense that Rob marinelli and Christmas chart have playing well that'll be the key can they win two in a row with in the tough part there is do they have a corner that can stop Amari Cooper um because he is tough who saw it last Thursday what did he did against the Redskins and this beat up secondary Jim Schwartz gonna have to help him because that Prescott in Amari Cooper have things clicking chin Schwartz his third year is Philly's defensive coordinator and his so banged up in that defensive backfield it's a good win in a classic division rivalry and now they have won two straight as the Redskins were held to just 36 yards in the second half here tonight when Washington lost cool McCoy with a fractured fibula Mark Sanchez had a step in Adrian Peterson made history now 106 career rushing touchdowns had the nine yarder but it was all about once and Earth's and that Eagles defense as they moved their mark now to six and six 28:13 our final next week we're going to be in Seattle we got Russell Wilson and the Seahawks against Kirk Cousins and the Vikings in another pivotal NFC matchup we better stay tuned for the GMC postgame report on SportsCenter for Jason Witten Berger McFarland and Lisa Salters I'm Joe tessitura enjoy the rest of your night including time with SVP to preview what is coming up on SportsCenter take it away Scotty that's thanks the Eagles take

today music power going quit ahead beginning to show a little bit of the a little more than a yard at LSU 13 yard line no prevent with the football right in my tree number 91 is on the left two wide receivers twins up on the right side Keith wouldn't Parker Brown the quarterback off to and Harvey's over the special they crying for the first down and he stopped somewhere three outside the tiger ii

extended the Notre Dame is still almost the yard short of a first down they need to go to the 11th the wall as f 212 requested that particular clean extension now let's do Hannah's most the veins 7 nothing was too funny for the goal in the first quarter here at Tiger Stadium and the are a half the ball on a crucial situation warm town a yard to go of the LSU 12 yard line highly father Canela do a lot of the hurt they re gone they set up in a frog wishbone with geek webs of the light here is the track to the right side first down for those remain as Andy huff carries on a quick dive play down to about the pants just outside the 10 yard line and many of the tiger fourth wall men including linebacker Lloyd spy make the Sun but it was simply a dive or flam's way straight ahead by fullback Andy Huff and no Sylvain has new life and four downs to make 10 yards and the score unless you had seven of eight cool receivers left and right here's fouled off the gulia and he charges into left

the goal line they had a chance to make a first down of course they were unable to destroy the Tigers have taken over one two players not try to get a little room if they could pop somebody through for seven yards down the hole otherwise definitely have defended but the defense of a magnificent job to the head of a big goal line stairs because no today in this pond saw a heavier football team but the Tigers utilized their quickness and their emotions stop the Irish at the goal line took the football over now move it out to the floor and now have a third down and seven situation in total offense in the first quarter LSU have 94 yards Notre Dame 61 LSU have 89 yards from the air and local vein none the Irish 61 yards on the ground on 17 plays in the first one and LSU got 8 yards on the 11th rushing play three first downs apiece it's LSU 7 notes si will be kicking he's standing just inside the end line the point of a down the 4 yard line Mike rowdy a single receiver expecting a short kick it's about a 36 yard average that si is closing right now it kicks the low line drive Kranti receives the LSU 22 and the rolling back down the field to the track of 37 and his bump literally off his feet there by Lloyd chi'lan of Bhoja city's 38 yards on sj6 a low liner first down for Notre Dame at the tiger 37 movin killin 51 on his jersey is from Bossier City and the E is the man who steps

rolls out of bounds at the Tiger 19 on the far side of the playing field and so quickly Notre Dame goes to the air and brings up a reception from the 718 yards on the completion to Gatewood and now Keith would've caught his 27th and now has over 260 yards 360 yards in the year and he ran straight ahead for and he ran straight ahead for about a yard second down and nine again Ronnie yes a planet for the cycle and he is a man who has been all over this defensive activity for LSU in the game so far note remain at the tiger 18 yard line with second down and nine to go the Tigers ahead 7 nothing Brown rolling off to the left prices open field plus the 15 he's down to the 11 and is rocked up at about 10 or 11 yard line by Capone and a man who is yet to get up boy try the ball is going to be placed at the tiger 10yard line one yard short of a first down as Browns wanted to throw but couldn't get the pass away and elected to run Mary is in that line back to LSU Marcus said widely to the right covered by Nagle Heat were on the Left covered by Casanova hands off Gossage number as well and duty the right side of the mind doesn't make the first down it's gone back Fire Lord Brian Norma Hodgins at the 10yard line and so again local vain faces fourth down and a yard to go and the tiger defensive team is making his stuff on play to hit run by Notre Dame when the yardage gets to be very important down deep LSU is the backs of the public I'm the game of fill hopefully 7nothing off and the yard and time is ball by him early it appears that Hartley wants to talk to the team and get the DS asked the crowd to be quiet a little bit so the Notre Dame team can hear it signals Notre Dame everything laid did not chaste for a timeout on the play fourth down and one yard to go at the LSU 10 Notre Dame after recovering an LSU fumble at the saiga 36 earlier and then in control the ball game but was stopped at the goal line and now has official situations again fourth and one at the LSU 10 Brown back to the right side will keep the ball the teeth the yard line on a keeper played to the right side the blocker that's relevant but just wasn't quite quick enough to get away with all Hodgins who's got the gap a Monday and makes the tackle the wallet book at the LSU 13 there's a loss of three all Alliance is in at quarterback for LSU and a second unit offensive team all the way through first attend LSU the Tigers have been very thin he down deep but there's a timeout on the field time out of the field here at Tiger Stadium with the store LSU 7th so far they've nothing they fans when

of the team on the field techniques aids in his foot in the for LSU and left psychoses suite at left guard Jimmy up into Center Logan chillin right guard Russell hell's Randy Russell at right tackle and the right hand is a man will pick up in just a minute here's the handoff to the tailback and trips and the hurdles up over the left side of the line for about two yards Jimmy LeDoux is in that split back shift Cavanaugh is the site in thankless is the fullback Stanton who just got a call as a sail back and the quarterback for LSU tall Lions first unit the pesky feet still on the field for Notre Dame they put the balls at 16 it's going to be second down and 7 throw at you Tigers their own territory and holding a 70 lead Stanton out of the eye gets the hand off and makes the depth around the left side the twins is there there's no gain these Street tried to block offenses but it would snow available back to the 14 as where he's drawn it third down and nine the LSU Tigers Bacchus their 14 yard line in settings a major part of this quarter with 11:35 to go in it and the part of the first quarter in their own territory after fumbling at their own 36 ears Lions behind killin takes the ball rolls out to the right gives off the van and an attack against the grain really by safety bad mic product go wide to the right Danna saw the camp open up on the left as the Irish were charging to the outside to stop the play and so dammit bothered a light enough to move ahead to the 28 yard line and pick up an LSU first down and give the Tigers some breathing room again the Irish set up a for 43 defense and rotate in the 2a for deep secondary with two linebackers and the others up on the line of scrimmage again bland grunts the option left gives off the banquet there's a good running average and he picks up about 2 or 3 yards on the play Cadiz and Mark and Patton stop in for Notre Dame at the 32 second down and six ago Benglis averaging 8 yards to carry a couple of real fine games NatWest with blistering speed but has great maneuverability and agility to get through small gaps in the defensive line second down and six tell us unit 32 again Lions at quarterback hands off the dampen and he rips it up over the left side of the line out to about the 35 and if not down there by Mikey nishan candidate for all America out of Nova's a first down a little more than to the gold grill as you on the hash mark from the far side here in the second quarter LSU is facing a small breeze that's blowing into the stadium from the southwest ten minutes to go in the first half Mizzou sent wide leases right he is from sulfur and Gerald Kelly from the state of Mississippi is to the left here's Lance back to throw being cheap won't get it away down he goes that is 26 and Swinson is the man who's charging back there to make the tackle and Lance could not get the pants delivered to Kegley apparently as he was looking back to him and all of a sudden from his back comes Fred Swenson to makes a big tackle for noted a wolf down 11 from the 26 and a half or seven Ron ESP is in to punt my karate is a single safety 10yard sleep in those four dangerous Ori again a low line drive spiral bobby backs up the ticket at his twenty nine the do over one team but close enough enough for Sonny to be tackled at his 33 this salmon who's injured on the play and Chen Cavanaugh Russell held announce quickly under a 25 yard kick and the return is good for about four yards our timeout is called near on the exchange that the football as Notre Dame will take over first and ten at the Irish 33 the timeout on the fields of scores LSU seven notes of ames nothing remember fans no matter what time of the year it is it's the right time to give you a cars cooling system the guaranteed protection of Texaco antifreeze coolant in summer it protects against boiling away in winter against Frieza and all year round it protects against corrosion rust and clogging so don't put off putting in technical antifreeze coolant or they guaranteed if used according to your car manufacturer's instructions you'll find it at your local technical retailer nine minutes and eight seconds left to go in the first half LSU is part of Notre Dame by a score of seven to nothing coming on a 36yard test from brick Jones Andy Hamilton to drive with 77 yards the Tigers took it in five plays two big plays of course the dishes of the 36 yard scoring play was a 36 yard pass from Hamilton from Joe's to Hamilton also Notre Dame has the football first and 10 at their own 33 yard line 67,000 five other people are more FGM their way into this huge Stadium here in Baton Rouge tonight for this great contest eight foot off of the Artic troubled wide to the right I'll let you in a sevenman line against the wishbone see this brown at quarterback for Notre Dame goes back Rahway give Sebelius wood has it at the Lannister ha she has had some great experience against the defensing the wishbone cheese and it has not been the wishbone has not been a particularly productive offensive formation against the LSU defense the unit second down Sam Notre Dame in a 33 yard line and setting up a double flops to the right lone remaining back his handy Huff full back flip round at quarterback then saw goes back pays off to his right running passing completes the Parker at the 41 yard line and covering on the play the Tigers Tommy Casanova and Frank receive and Barca was going down to the turf as he made the reception at the 41 third ensues interesting to parents here in scoring Notre Dame has not allowed any point in the third and fourth quarters opponent LSU story have been and its greatest in the third quarter all totaled up and all of the time and although this productive in the book water third down and two huh off to the right blow up down back behind the line of scrimmage but breaks away and finally gets past pepper rutlander who eventually makes the tackle somewhere around the 43 yard line Andy Huff carries a tackle application not quite a first down homey a number 95 guerrilla units plopped down and just teaches to go and the Irish want another measurement beam is left on the field a short distance and is now being extended and not quite a first down again Notre Dame faces a critical decision though it should not be a great one at this point of the football field and at this point in the game LSU holds the seven nothing lead for seven and a half minutes to go in the first half and the irish am plops down and just a couple of inches to go for a first down at their own 43 and apparently the irish will kick that would be the percentage that will be called for in the game are a strength protects an eighth in one season but trailing LSU 7 to nothing last week Tulane greenies next up on the LSU schedule next week and a lot of the properties of this game are similar to those of the Allies a Tulane end of the game game five steps Adani the punter and he books it LeDoux backing up on the ball may not feel that the ball bounces at the tool the one is going to roll dad at the zoo yard Keith wood and all floors are down deep under there to sip on the ball after a 55 yard effort by brand party and so the Tigers will have the ball at their two first down and 10 yards to go it was in the game last year at South Bend that the Irish used the kicking game that he fellas you bottled up most of these late stages of the games and eventually the kicking game was the difference Tigers with Jones Shorey and tech late and the Kentrell in the backfield Joe Barrett Center handoff goes to Cantrell he's backed up by John mazurka that's about the 6 yard line on an attempt straight ahead 7 minutes remaining the first time the ball is at the LSU 7 yard line and it is going to be second down and about five and a half to six yards to go for a first day my car lineup and the facing of five fans front set up by Notre Dame's everybody on their marks and here's a hand off the Cantrell and he sprouted them by mazurka and company at the line of scrimmage an offense that left tackle they are going to say his fallen advant have carried him up to the eight yard line Erik Patton in for a part of the tackle and the Tigers are still trying to go inside the festive West fans for no pervane that would be the area covered by wall makowsky they're fed by many people that Pataki will be a very important man on allstar teams that year and also on collections postseason two wide receivers left third down and about for Jones off the cancer out katie's has him in line at about the 11 yard line a Cantrell was trying to get to the outside left and so the Tigers will have Ronnie si and Logan killing coming in job Aaron Jones come out it will be a punting situation tell us you just outside in the tent Tigers have not had good field position since their first possession which they took from their own 23 on in for a floor they've been backed up our offense notre dame's staying right with his game plan and with one deep receiver Crotty they have a rush on the kicker on and the fair catch signal called Mike Ronnie he fumbled the ball we go through it joseline pleases hazard at the tiger 45 yard line rowdy made a fair catch signal and had to run up on the ball which came up short to the LSU porridge Ronnie fumbled the ball and finally it was the beauty of Kent pleases to make the recovery and now they say officially the LSU 46 yard line movin Hillis with the man making a good charge of the ball trying for a production for elegies and again timeout as with the place of the football the tiger 46 Notre Dame in possession and as we summon it don't remain that an LSU territory ever since Jones fumbled the ball going back for a pass and his 36 and the Irish pulls the ball down the goal line did not score and later gave up the ball at the 10 yard line type out of the deal urology with the floor the Tiger 7 fighting RH stomach the Constitution you gasoline frost Texaco have just the right gas remains all their gasoline they have one of the most advanced editing packages and any gasoline you can buy on the market today they're especially designed for both center performance and for cleaner air so when you need gasoline no matter what kind of car you drive trust the people to Texaco they make great gasoline and one is just right for you five minutes and 20 seconds left to go on the first half of a shoe in front of Notre Dame by a score of seven to nothing let me count the number 80 is in his foot and promoter Dame and he's wide to the right on the wishbones here's the reverse play with bouncing coming wide to the left he's pointing up to Melanie he's at the 40 the foot he fired the 3225 he's at the LSU 15 he's out of bounds at the Tiger 12 yard line rice out of bounds by Joe Winkler Tommy Casanova and the tiger is injured on the plate Johnny word has the turns ankle and hobbled off the field on the near side out of the wishbone with a flanker to the right a split ends of the right actually Townsend just into the game to the wide side of the field Julian took the handoff from the quarterback rolled out to the right and handed on the reverse back to Thompson off to the near side and he bullets down to the tank at 12 and again the Irish of threatenings Browns quarterback rolling out to the rain will run a pass he alone makes the Piron inside the pen he's at the seventh down he goes at the LSU 7 yard line in the show that makes the tackle before the next point at pause 10 second for station identification this is the LSU football Network and this is wwl in New Orleans radio 87 with Studios the worldfamous French Quarter again the Irish are knocking on the door second down in about six the ball at the LSU seventh and Notre Dame is taking one of his time out on the ground Notre Dame is six up 108 yards so far in the air completed two or three passes for 26 yards on the ground LSU has gained only 29 while through the air they've completed three of four passes for total of 89 yards panting hi mother catching all three of them but the Tigers have been backed up throughout the entire second quarter been applauded a firstborn of a disco in their first possession that's what we stand now the defense has been just tremendous although they did get kind of stung on the last play of a 34 yard gain on the reverse for 33 left to go in the first half LSU on defense back to the wall again they've got to play super defensive warp the Irish previous possession Notre Dame has gotten down to the LSU one the LSU 13 the 43 and now the seven Jim Gainey is coming in for LSU a defensive end he's been injured a couple of games an outstanding sophomore from Hammonds and Jack himit is remaining in the game a defensive right end he's a junior for Baton Rouge weighs 195 and he's in in place of the number one unit John Wood has entered an ankle or a knee and as being attended to on the near side second down and five at the LSU seven notes of aim again threatening with a double slot to the left hands off to Andy Huff and he pull it's to the left right hand left guard down to the five in China love Fosse with company meats in there gained a few skipped come\u00f6 spin on the tackle it's third down and three at the LSU five and began the going gets a little sticky down deep Notre Dame has controlled all departments of this football game since the recovery of a fumble at the tiger 36 back in the middle of the first quarter after the LSU score of the Tigers lead seven nothing back there for a scene that one of the safety props for LSU third down at the Tiger five free to go for a first down here Tufts playing his left ankle he's into about the free maybe the two and a half North Sheffield stops him f23 so now in a small town and the yards to go again deep in LSU territory one time the Irish had sauce and a couple of inches and love the name again will call for timeout Brown wants to consult the folks mark again one time in the game the Tigers held each is away from their goal line again with a fourth down and one at the LSU ten conscience bill found for a three yard long and now again the Irish have fourth down and one to go at the LSU three this time here comes Johnny woods back in the game for LSU and so flip Brown sophomore quarterback is having a discussion on the far side of the field with the Irish coaching staff while this cheerio is talking things over with the time stamp on the near side both a strategy is being developed now and no surname has an important decision to make here trailing 20 the seventh with 336 to go in the first half about whether to go for the 1 yard the touchdown or for three points and here comes flip ground back in the game can't help but speculate if Notre Dame doesn't make it how many people maybe second guessing Cartesian for not taking the threepoint he's supposed to have a real good field goal kicker so fourth down and one yard to go apparently the re will be trying for the first down or the touchdown Gallagher's in at fullback or wingback and Huff ascended fullback and Julius and failback they're setting up a strong high to the right and Jimmy art Lee is charging LSU with a timeout and Luis Castillo and foot brown go to the respected coaching staff again to toss things over LSU leading seven nothing and the maneuvering is now getting very intensive offensively and defensively Notre Dame with the fourth down and one at the OSU three the Tigers have sucked serve the re deep in their own territory extremely deep on similar situations on fourth down play Larry Parker will come in at wing back for Notre Dame bill Gallagher normally a fullback goes out and so Julia huh and Parker will be behind cliff Brown the quarterback for Notre Dame LSU has its number one defensive unit on the field and let's see what the Tigers can do defensively as the Irish come up with their offensive set a very tight draw knife to the right ground the quarterback walked down and one to go rolls off to the right looking for a receiver Justin in the info Parker and movin up by linebacker live fries on the fifth time in the first half the Tigers go back CRH on warfare and as LSU football listen Sam at the tiger 3 well against it at the Tiger defense forgets this magnificent play you can't expect any better than that Notre Dame is an excellent field position throughout the course of the evening and wipes out deep inside the private Riga to stop them elegy will try to be straightforward in the situation with Jones at quarterback he hands off the Cantrell Cantrell where is out over left tackle for about five yard and the stop hard at about the 8 yard line Rick : number 38 is the man of along with Mike Ditka 79 second down and five to go the Tigers after eight ahead of Notre Dame's seven nothing this game is developing into another one of those real football epic here's Andy Hamilton to the right and off goes to shore he sure he is wrecked up at the 10 yard line for the play he was wired to the right and sure he went over the right side of the mine Erik Hatton and zika's collaborate on the tackle shouldertoshoulder at the pan third down and three LSU at its 10yard line ahead of Notre Dame by a score of 7 nothing this is the last game of the year for Notre Dame LSU has tough Tulane remaining next week burt jumps behind Jack Jill bear Hamilton set to the right back field strong last here's Jones hitting the ball rolling out to the left side he's crawling out to about the 12 and that's as far as he can go tough to block big man like Fred Flintstone and drag marks weighing 235 apiece and 20 comes up for a part of the tackle and they're placing the ball between the 11 well about the 11 yard line it falls down and Ronnie ssay will be in to punt for LSU kicking average into the game a little short of 36 yards and again Notre Dame sets up a single safety Mike Ronnie and the Irish if things go well for them here will have great field position again here's a kick going to cron a fair catch that's the tiger 46 and so from that point for the second side on as many putts receptions the re set up shop at the bag of 46 33 yards for SC on the kick and we may have an infraction while Pataki is being called from the sidelines to make the decisions man with the white cap Jimmy aren't laid notre dame going to the air so far unsuccessfully from the LSU 46 yard line John stank coming in with some defensive suggestions for the Tigers team and Frank was seen a presort comes out upended 32 to go in the first half LSU 7 votes remain nothing Brown has a frog set to the right Keith what sets up on the left he and Queenie are reversing position and they're little confused out there third down and 10 here surround going back in the market deep pocket to throw Justin up the middle intercepted by the phone at the Tiger 43 territory to the 40 bill going down to the 32 yard line and has rushed up there by John Hendricks the health of a 32 a fullback in high school at Patras Catholic high intercept Browns fan fortythree like a big bull now the feos of Anoka veins dirty food twentyfive guards on the interception return down to the RH 32 and so let's see if the Tigers can printed around leaning those remain 7nothing Jones in a passing condition on the field takes the ball goes back to throw and the ball past time kisses complete the Hanigan at the 15 down the field and the SHA break inside the safety man Mike Ronnie almost went on the ground at the 15yard line with one hand on the stamp turn it on in the endzone for the tankers friggin touchdown in the past Hamilton has the boat for a possible man he's having perhaps his greatest side of the year he Mikaelson will try the

surprising particularly the Irish football team as Jones the Hamilton has worked well for two touchdowns so far in the game tell us you really charged up particularly after stopping Notre Dame's offensive team four times on 4th down deep inside LSU territories first down the re brown rolling back draw play gifts to Julius here he comes to five yards rough feel the left guard there filled by

Baton Rouge Louisiana with LSU in front of Notre Dame by a score of 14 to nothing we see some tremendous defense on the part of the Tigers tonight and the passing of Bert Jones has been exemplary he did make one mistake the pummelled on the 36 yard line that kept the Tigers back deep in their own territory throughout the better part of the half but once they got good field position after Warren Capone's interception at the Notre Dame 32 the tires the Tigers took only two runs one play to get it in and that was a 32 yard pass to Hamilton Hamilton has both touchdowns tonight the 36 yard pass from Jones in the first quarter the 32 yard from his cousins in the second quarter Jay Michaelson has been successful on both extra point attempt so at halftime it's LSU 14 Notre Dame's nothing we'll

eight times for third with 19 yards in passing Jones is four for five lines not completed the past Pamela has fought all four of the completions for 121 yards and two touchdowns Gatewood has caught two for a total of 32 yards talk alone for eight yards so the Tigers lead the scoreboard and they'd close as far as statistics is concerned game just about the down is how it was bigge prior to the kickoff tonight that Notre Dame is very difficult to run the football against of course the Tigers as far as field position of are concerned is very that very poor field position because they've been backed up inside there the playing field have been a part of evening and of course the lake tremendous defense chef motivated for putting points on the board they've gotten deep into LSU territory on numerous occasions but the defense is funny though Notre Dame catfish was coming back out onto the play field of the 44 gate flipped over 85 Pataki and here come the Tigers right now we'll do this at the LSU football Network get set for the second half kickoff Notre Dame when they thought at the beginning of the football game so the option for the second half rests with LSU and they want the

Michigan will be in the Rose offered in Oklahoma and the sugar Penn State in Texas and the cops Bowl first down and tend to go for LSU at the tiger 41 to the right Kegley and Hamilton sent very widely quarterback as Jones he hands off the jory and he paddles his way up for about three yards Astro Bluebonnet ball at Houston New Year's Eve Colorado and Houston Gator Bowl North Carolina and Georgia

and he was piece of the 50 yard breaks a tackle su comes the nearside in the 45 and shifts out of bounds at the Notre Dame 44 yard line by late chased out by Ralph Stefani acts but Bert Jones was not all that fleet of foot runs for the first sound as the Irish defense caught itself covering well deep and crashing down on the LSU passing market and Jones just eluded all of the defenders picks up a first down as the notes of a 44 yard line 40 nothing LSU a hand and looking good tag late to the left Hamilton to the right along the sideline Jones off of the tailback and that's Cantrell bumping ahead at the 41 he has the gain of free and Wolfpack off he crashes in on him and close him down easily help from Mike Cadiz and Jim mazurka second down at the 41 seven yards to go from the Irish 41 yard line and we'll see what the Irish do with the Tigers here in the third corners and coach Parseghian of Notre Dame is the presenter of a great reputation with the words in the dressing room at

nothing lead Darnay gets the snap the Tigers with the big right kick is going to be short off to the right he was Harris family behind the line and the pitches marked out at the LSU 25yard line so there is a kicks of 20 yards linked and the Tigers come up with better than expected field position LSU ahead by 14 to nothing eight minutes and nine seconds to go in quarter number three and the timeout has been called timeout in the game here at Tiger Stadium with the score the LSU Tigers 14 the Notre Dame Fighting Irish nothing they'd ever notice how your car seems to catch a cold in the winter or act like it's about to have a heat stroke in the summer Mexico's Hamilton superpremium oil temperature motor oil can cure a lot of your cars temperature problems if you want to lubricate and protect your car's engine to keep it from catching a cold or having a heat stroke trust Texaco Havoline super premium all temperature motor oil eight minutes and nine seconds left to go in the third quarter the Tigers have the football four to ten at their own 25 yard line after stopping no no babe they'll go from their own 26 out of the LSU 45 20 yard kick in for the Tigers the Running Room to get their offense under way and it'll be berth Jones back in at quarterback for the Tigers here this evening maybe game very timely enough but what you'll repeat in Park for you season ticket sales

game on January the 3rd it's a gorgeous place and you want to be instead courtside when the basketball feast begins with Maravich palaces that he'll have a good effort for his team this year now here's the handoff from Jones to Bandhan and he tries the left side picks up freshly nothing brake marks trailed him down Wallace near the northeast floor of the playing field on the inbound line from the far side 755 to go in quarter number three in this game and LSU holds a 14 to nothing lead recapping first half statistics on the ground LSU had 38 yards Notre Dame at 108 in the air the Tigers 121 and Notre Dame 40 so about an even game in total offense Jones is back to throw a long pass out here and the kid was trying to elude Ellis both men are very fast and Hamilton was making a cut to the outside but the flight of the ball took a couple of three seconds and so they cut to the outside in Joan's estimation was not the way he had thought that Hamilton would move we have a discussion on the play and LSU now is picking up a 15yard penalty or half the distance penalty back to the 12 that's a little more than halfway gentlemen or a personal foul offensive holding against LSU and so second down back to the 12 and now the LSU Tigers have second down and 23 yards to go for a first down oddly enough that's the first family in this ball game Hamilton has set to the right side and LeDoux is along the sidelines left and Jones fakes the pass hands off the famine breaks his ankle and it's chased down outside the 20 by the last man who had a contact with him and that was number 81 Jim O'Malley right inside linebacker and they're placing the ball at the 21 yard line third down and 14 to go for the LSU Tigers half their 21 7 minutes left to go in the third quarter LSU ahead 14 to nothing here at Tiger Stadium Jelena's neck Saturday 7:30 Hamilton to the right side and Joan's on third and 13 is to pass screen pass incomplete to that and he didn't want it Rick Coleman was bearing

backing up through 7 2 punch digging average in the first half 37 yard for sa low snap from center he gets a wobbler away chronic called for a fair catch at his 44 yard line and he goes down to his knees first sound and tend to call for the Irish again with good field position at the Notre Dame 44 yard line a 35yard kick and again timeout has been called time out of this game at Tiger Stadium and here's the score LSU 14 Notre Dame nothing they'd ever think your car has might you know your turn a corner or little bump in it squeaks it's not Mike it's worse it's excessive friction this friction can learn your car to get rid of the squeaks visit the Texaco service station and ask them our faculty job not back won't leak out or dry out trust Texaco SmartPak to drive the squeaks out

124 yards on the ground Notre Dame is rushed for 137 yards and they accepted on three of ten passes what they were 30 yards but the scores the thing in the pack acidifier a score of two touchdowns and two extra points to nothing as the tempo of the game is set around two primarily defense at the present time neither team bench the thoughts of the third quarter they're gonna manage much of an

Extension and Notre Dame has picked up another first down this time again ten yards down the field and the Irish are coming up with some real touchy situations here on measurements but they have enjoyed and they've been moving from their own end of the playing field on this Drive nothing fancy about the Notre Dame attack they go to the air the most short down and outers that have a hit it is virtually impossible to stop Brown and the Irish from the LSU 36 flip it back to pass left one way down the field to are for Parker to the end zone Parker however has Kovac sent his defender Johnny

the they were disabled to put eight points on the board I'm a liberal do tonight Fagin seemingly on their way to winning number seven of the year vigor office has been tappable to that but with blanks in the Florida game in the middle of the playing season probably the most efficient night offensively the Tigers have have had up to this point and defensively the LSU effort tonight has no doubt been of the year against the top trade opposition and the Tigers have contained the Irish and have passed the big plays when the clutches demanded a second down and ten here's the run to the last by the quarterback Paul lands he's at the 30 bucks out of bounds at the 27 yard line first out of LSU maybe and Mark and Fridays that go for Notre Dame the Tigers ball Alliance running the football he's the

half yards out long I to the right here's a runs of the left on the counter and Lance can't get rid of the body is looking for a B and the D might have been covered by Coleman and globe alignment leading the way the funky echo Lions and the Packers have call for timeout land loses yardage back to the 13 yard line 25 seconds for playing time too many what before the game this year the Irish have scored 8.2 that was against Purdue when the re pulled it out in the late stages of the game after recovering a boilermaker fumble deep in Purdue's territory the final score that game second of the year from Oak Lane was 8 to 7 so again the Irish have eight points on the scoreboard but LSU fighting targets from the Biotest we have 21 a few people Colorado best of the Tigers 31:21 and then the Tigers beat Texas A&amp;M these layouts George would not be priced Florida easily Greek flag Kentucky's then lost a close game Ole Miss of the Jackson and one of the years great gain loss to Alabama 14 to 7 and then best Indies laban to be state last week third down and goal to go from the Notre Dame 13 for LSU ahead 21 to 8 and 25 seconds left to play the quarterback will epad he has the ball rolls back off to the right will throw get the down better handled it up is the floor I like you ahead of a doctor and we'll hold no surveys being bested easily by LSU here tonight for LSU pudding no survey in peace well the package goes 50 yards add a flame and with only 20 seconds left to go in a ballgame they put 7 more on the port they're not on top front of Notre Dame by a score of 28 to 8 and of course this speed crowd here is just aesthetic just aesthetic there's a tiger ban notice them many of the students have come out of the stands they've jumped over the fence install here at Bagatelle recently and I copy it followed the fear that isn't the coach to define to keep him away from the field well the excitement is the thing the brains supreme right now and the Tigers have their fans ready to charge on the field Notre Dame is being beaten by LSU 28 to 8 and here is a kick by Michelson down the field that has taken at the 24 yard line that's Gallagher coming back out to the 45 and to the 46 yard line 13 seconds left to play in the game Wallace way back at the our age 45 yardline those who vain babbling brook behind but too far away to catch up it's when attacker night now I should came up with the big spirits of big scenes at the opening Gong and they've been going ever since illegal motion against Notre Dame long pass by a new quarterback in the game it's incomplete Epstein Berg is the quarterback number 11 that come on the floor long incomplete Notre Dame in motion illegally 8 seconds left to play in the game it doesn't matter we have many thousands of people ready to charge on the field the police are saying the best they can but they'll not contain this crowd not often do LSU cloud bars on the playing field but this will be one 5 yards Henley against the Irish back to their for me for legal motion 28 slate is the shore and a fighting night and an exciting year of college football for LSU steamboat again way down the field town we'd at the booty and one second remains to be played so the crowd comes on the playing field and we may not have enough beauty to play another play we have about 15,000 people on the field and I think probably they'll just call it off from here one second remains on the scoreboard clock and the officials are going to say it's no good this game is over and there's too many people on the playing field the FICA players and the Notre Dame players are intermingled of on the fan the way the Venus is a big success the client agrees from 20 eat sweets over the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Irish a disappointed group from South Bend are making their way back to their dressing room under the and at the southeast corner of the three most cold the Tigers Sun Bowl invitation has been accepted and LSU will play against Iowa State in the Sentinel of El Paso Texas the afternoon of Saturday December 18th the irish record eight and soon and that's all for Notre Dame for 1971 and LSU is now 7 and 3 with archrival Tulane remaining to be played next week on the same field it's been a big night the coach the Clinton and the LSU Tigers a disappointing run for no surveys walter hill has the final words in a minute again the final score here at Tiger Stadium on the campus of LSU the LSU Tigers 28 the Notre Dame Fighting Irish eight well it's all over and this has to go down is one of our shoes greatest victories this is the game people have been waiting for for more than five years and the fourth the football team is waiting for just last year they self they played what enough to grown up in South Bend but they didn't they lost it three to nothing the dedicated themselves this year during a football game at a great least worth I know on Thursday I had a chance to talk at Lake Fulani yesterday he told me ball they said we want this in more than any other football game we've ever had here in Tiger Stadium well they will not make got it and they scored in every corner of the ball game just as he did last week against Mississippi State this tiger touchdown came in the first quarter on a 36yard test from Brett Jones sandy Hamilton in the second quarter a 32 yard pass from virtue and Sandy Hamilton connected in the third quarter a five yard run by Bert Jones and in the fourth a 13yard pass from Portland's to Andy Hamilton Hamilton was just amazing out here this evening we don't keep individual statistics but he has to have had more than 140 yards in past receptions tonight in the air the Tigers completed 8 of 10 for a total of 156 yards on the ground the Tigers rushed for total 143 yards no today meanwhile rushed for 168 yards with Brown completed 13 of 31 passes for one other than 51 yard in first downs the Tigers got 14 what a name cut 16 as far as mistakes are confirmed the Tigers lost two fumbles but the tiger defense was certainly to the occasion tonight stopping Notre Dame in the first quarter at their own oneyard line well with the deceptive three times that combine the Tigers converted two of those into touchdowns they lost the fumble so it was not a good night for Notre Dame at all once again though the Tigers win it by a score of 28 to 8 they play Tulane here at Tiger Stadium next Saturday night kickoff will be at 7:30 the regular time and then on December the 18th they will journey to El Paso Texas to play in the Sun Bowl against Iowa State a winner although it's almost a fifth before nothing today the students have just about this mantle the North Pole they've got one of the arms down one of the uprights is down and they've Ricky on the other one there's a huge mass of humanity on the playing field at the present time they fill it out onto the playing field with only one second remaining division decided to go ahead and call it over so it was a great victory for LSU tonight defeating Notre Dame here the second time this played and unfortunately than Irish Kentucky back on the tiger schedule any time in the near future but it was a great game for LSU of if you wind up next week against Tulane they're wound up if there are successful to go school and they wound up with an eighth win and three losses we said before they will play on the Sun Bowl on December the 18th against Iowa State so once again the final score LSU 28 Notre Dame 8 or John Ferguson this is walter hill saying good night the dragon",

hasn't turned the ball over once typical Ohio State performance to the 36 yard line is Bamford when John Brock Eden Larry Butler put him down as the up entity the second down seven as we told you during the year Ohio State fumble the ball away only five times and nine two and a half of us remaining in the third period 17 to 13 Ohio State leading turn keeps may have been a mess up on the handoff timing destroyed they've tipped and tackled him and Dennis Moore on a 33 yard line of Stanford Ohio State has a third down and four as Stanford moved one of its defensive tackles over there he knows of the offensive Center you can never tell whether a quarterback is automatically or not we just assumed turn tried to got a little mixed up in the backfield third and four then running the keeper goes again he starts that slider that's off the old split key that slide down the line of scrimmage only they option on the tackle if he stays out turn cuts inside and you see his cutting ability that's the secret of that option quarterback is the ability to turn and cut upfield as quickly as kern does if you come in and take him in he's going to pitch out for the trailing at fatboyron first down Ohio State now state now is on the stanford 28 Bell Ohio State as we go everybody this year in the third period they're getting a real battle from Stanford and the field goal in this quarter and that's it a minute 20 remaining in the third parallel Pastis up to the right rocking in like a wild buffalo charging he bears very well doesn't he Kyle it really does and Dennis more they outside linebacker in forest Anson was in good position just doe rocking man's ability to give him a limp leg go right over it second down five Ohio State on the stand for 23 they all Hayden looks like a man through the glass attached underneath number 78 is just over the Stanford 20 we're in the last 30 seconds of the third period third down and a yard the dog here comes turnout Mesa Jeske replaces him turn got a big hand he's played another brilliant rose ball games go to the outstanding player of this game of the sophomore two years ago they're closed rich scalpels I think the reason Kern came out of a ball game either his hand re even guys maybe even got his foot stepped on on that last play were handed off to Hayden either that or got his thumb jammed look lucky not seriously bothered he's maybe one client let's turn going back here now fourth down and about two or three inches to go Stanford 19 and they asked her to cry the quiet down and that's the end of the quarter the end of the third quarter in the 1971 Rose Bowl game with a score oh hi Oh state seventeen Stanford thirteen if you could put a plastic shield on your face you'd have protection from Nicks and cuts but

in a tight ballgame here they're your first downs 19 to 11 this is Curt Goudy and Kyle wrote and we're starting the fourth quarter each team had a field goal in the third period laughs state has run up 372 yards on the ground we 127 for Stanford fourth and inches on a Stanford 19 Oh John Crocodylus top it's one of the few times he's been stopped all year that great quick off the mark power he had and what are their 21st now USC Arkansas Oregon Washington UCLA now Plunkett sets him down and he spread offense for the two receivers out we're gonna go to the sideline out of bounds there's the meal Washington Kim Anderson forced him out that's the fifth ball that Washington was caught Bob Morris clap for ha ha they've been able to hit him only once second down four to go Stanford on their 26 they're trailing 1713 we just got in the fourth period the slant pattern that's the plate for a first down did Jamil watched him again in front of him Anderson welcome now 14 out of 23 bucket very wary of the red dogs by Ohio State that time it was Jack Tatum coming in from his left very sure to have the quick the quick passage to take very little time to get off and then for Stanford our 36 Lassiter's with late wife Linda the outside man now on East 38th and he's into the Ohio State bench Chad Williams and Jim still wagon ran him out of bounds I think he thought better the bench then Tatum Tatum was right on his trail to blaming second down and eight the Gulf with a Stanford India quarterback draw the big strong quarterback rips away and pulls to the 48 210 pounds went to the final to the north California wrestling tournament in high school hey you see doc item 63 dropping back John sandy 55 coming through here comes Plunkett attention ball number three you can open field runner first down for Stanford on their own 48 yard line and yard run by Jim Plunkett time again and a 50 fatah ha Lambie Fatah catches his second ball of the game and he's out on the 42 wasn't working no sideline that have been many times they've not put two men on the taha that time since the ball was going to drop over and help out Taha goes out to Mia Washington replaces him that leaves Lassiter and Washington in is the wide outside wide men and here the first down measurement what he Hays talking to one of the officials where they have the best look in the house Sanford has a first down on the Ohio State 42 they've driven from their own 20 the score 17 to 13 in favor of Ohio State thirteen minutes and 47 seconds remaining out of the slot right just over the 40 Jackie Brown they haven't been able to run much against this Ohio State team Doug Adams got underneath him they clunk it just trying to give them enough running to make them honest make them respect the running game Stanford not in a fight for the number one position in the country but knows it could really wrap up a great season with a win here today in an upset over Ohio State knocking down eight Howard to bring the caja dammit aha is tricky after he kept to the ball you can see Vitara all alone now and what really put him all alone was fact that bucket move shocked way up into that little slot position the air comes Statham who had had to cover shot way monka trying to get Ohio State to cover one on one rather than double cover Fattah ha that attack allowed shad Williams first down Stanford on the Ohio State 31 quite a drive Stanford putting on now and as the passing of Jim Plunkett by Stan white the linebacker at the Ohio State 28 Jacque Lee and Jackie Brown will be back next year the Stanford running backs the heart of a Tahoes back in now replacing Daniel Washington second down 7 12 and a half minutes to play in the game or housemate leading 17 to 13 Stanford on the March Ohio State 28 trying to set up a faster Lassiter earlier in the game Eric Frost took that Roberto was Fatah ha and ran 40 yards with it they were going to reverse it to him again but I am sure but Taha was going to try and pass the Lassiter who was down there in the end zone alas sir was open for a few steps deep and of course Lata had no chance at all at no time to even get the ball up Detroit wire here about the stars on the helmets over for outstanding performances when they grade the defensive and offensive films every time a player gets a good grade on the game film they receive a star on their helmet third down now Plunkett looking he's good on a broken play fires on the run the more this catch by Babur bucket having to break his pattern now fires to the corner and there is a diving catch by Bob more for breaking his pattern now looking for an opening bucket loose throws the ball number 19 Don lamb cook trailing this for is good of receiving tied in and you ever want to look at today buckets big play a broken pattern he's so strong they can throw on a run and deep on a broken pattern first and goal look at trying to dive when he's hit on a yard line they try to dive over Jack Tatum Doug Adams many Mara 11 minutes to play in the game Stanford can take the lead if they drive in there on the Ohio State oneyard line and as you look at the field you'll see the paint on the grass it's on the inside of the goal line you'll see the thin stripe that is the goal I like the white paint all right a second down a yard to go for a Stanford touchdown pluck it again he's got laughs with the one is big and strong on that quarterback sneak running up against a tough line lettner got underneath him by Doug Adams third down a yard to go for what could be a go ahead Stanford touchdown every team

gets in that position it's just like anybody else playing in their backyard playing football it's oneonone and you just make the moves you think you have to make excellent after he catches the ball the offside is declined by Stanford against Ohio State with a first down for Stanford on the Ohio State 14 Jamil Washington replaced a jack Lassiter well they weren't getting that ball of a taha until about five or six minutes ago now he's got four balls in the game Stanford on the Ohio State 14 a first down Stanford's ahead 22 17 they run it to the 10 and that's Jackie Brown will score two touchdown might make one point Ohio State has changes defensive alignment they've now been in a fourman line in other words they've moved Jim still wagon off the nose of John sandy the center moved him over in front of a guard and that time they'd moved him over in front of Dan Lightfoot Lightfoot making an excellent block taking still wagon to the inside Lasser to the right they're in a slot second down six on the 10 bucket fires into the end zone no good by boy the tide in that time was covered well by Kim Anderson Dolby third down and six for Stanford on the Ohio State ten Ohio State's still driving in on Plunkett George Hazen all that time putting pressure on him fighting off his blockers getting into the area what could've hit 244 yard 17 out of 28 and they spread ease passing around swing pattern and they caught the safety blitz there you say sensabaugh number three coming in left the opening harmony that's where since the ball would be and he read it perfectly I always see Fattah look at the great outside fakie game there's a very sensible safety read dog Plunkett picked it up perfectly the fake on Harry Howard sorry let's get good Rosewall the score stanford 27 final state 17 now we return you to our studios for this message Marlboro country a good smoke at the end of a working days you've been moving hard since sunup in dusty bathe the cattle stop their move things begin to settle down seems like town a million away forty miles arriving do the ndouble working today his fellow back shadows run catch the big red settle son the evening of come to where the flavor is come to Marlboro country you know before these two teams took the field where they opening kickoff Ohio State knew that Texas was defeated so they were going maybe for the number one now Nebraska laying out there in Miami in the Orange Bowl and when it's all over they could be the undefeated team along with Arizona State which by playing in the West mostly in Saturday night does not get the recognition of and then ask the ranking another deep kick by Horowitz I run this one out that's what they like to do anytime you keep a team are running a kickback over it's 20 you've done your job on the kickoff and be on the 13 yard line the Bob Hope Desert Classic will be coming up Saturday and Sunday February 13th and 14th on NBC we have 8 minutes and 14 seconds left and Stanford had the ball only her Ohio State's head of all only 55 seconds in this period Stanford's used ball control but with a pass instead of the run Rex Curnow goes to the air and it's no good to Jan white in power with a running attack and not a good passing team when you're behind like this it's gonna be tough for Ohio State it really is that ball control type of offense it becomes really a measurable handicap if that clock doesn't have enough time left on it eight minutes a little over eight minutes eight minutes 10 seconds Mesa Joshi is in quarterback he's a better long floor that turned the lane is also in second and ten Ohio State on here 13 they throw and that one then complete that pass it again dan white Poseidon came right back to him Benny Barnes doing excellent job on covering I think you've played defensive secondary Philly came to Ohio State and there's Rex Kern back in the Ohio State backfield 27 to 17 Stanford ahead ten point on her dog they're ahead by 10 now roll out with burn gonna get that first down and he brings it up to age 25 Rex burn gets it turn now is 125 yards rushing in this game from the quarterback position there's an example of the problem gap with a running quarterback turn having to come off the field again shaking up a bit on the play have to be awfully sturdy to hold up under that type of beating that you take when you keep that ball on the option they're attending him Mesa Josh key puts him down on its first down Ohio State under 25 he's under the gun and he is pulled down on his 23 getting in there chewing was Dave Tipton the thunderchicken up front for Stanford the loss of two for Ohio State they have a second down and 12 and the clock ticking away against Ohio State we're approaching seven minutes remaining in this game they undefeated untied ohio state buckeyes our trailing before and inspired stanford team he's hit as they released the ball but completes at the jan white at the 32 yard line that was a great throw by Mesa jostling because he was really Belet as he let the ball go Jan white looked like he was down on his knee maybe he got up in time normally that was so quick and macey gauss key going back here's what happens to you after you let that ball go on the Ohio State 32 third down and three the house state has to keep possession 33 and that's all they're short of a first down John Brockington who follows in a long line of great Ohio State fullback last 8 always seems to have full backs and tackles Jim Otis Bob Ferguson Bob white and that snow and out John bakudan fourth down in the yard to go for Ohio State trailing 27 to 17 under six minutes remaining they're in the Rose Bowl the lights are on they're going for it Oh half too they don't get it there's stuff at the 34yard line Geoff's semen in there the middle linebacker and Stanford stops Ohio State on the Ohio straight 34 timeout the Stanford takes over action will continue here at the Rose Bowl the score Stanford 27 oh hi oh States 17 hi I invited Robert for dinner oh how nice he's kind of special mom special and I only have cold cuts well why don't I just go and get some Kentucky Fried Chicken oh good told you my mom

Colonel's hey I didn't know we were having Kentucky Fried Chicken Oh Colonel can I have another piece of your chicken please there's your time 541 to go Stanford's ball on the Ohio State 34 first down Stanford leading 27 to 17 Jackie Brown yessum drive on that one didn't he like he exploded in luckner hit him around the ankles the knocking loose Bob more the tied in what a game he's played into the first half he were voting for the most valuable player of this game I imagine you'd vote for Rex Kern right now I think the title swung over to Jim Plunkett passed for 250 yards with an eighteen or twenty nine second down three and Hilary Shockley is to the Ohio State 24 Jim still wagon and Stan White on him third down in the short yard to go stampers had the ball about 80% of the time in the fourth quarter first down for Shockley to the 19 of Ohio State mycsustan bar the safety man made the stop on him tremendous job of blocking in the middle again John sandy blocking on Jim still wagon both outstanding performers they'll both be pretty sore tomorrow morning just a constant hitting colleague Stanford on the Ohio State 19 leading 2717 four minutes to play there it is after the kaha the 15 and he stops short of the first down at the lean land Eva Taha out on a flat and catching those balls here late in the game that's five for him now he not only won with about eight or nine minutes to go on a 12 yard line of Ohio State that will be second down and two Lassiter comes in the meal Washington out as the outside receiver that was playing ball control not only with their running but a passing game well stay here an into something that time Jackie Brown stopped cold on the Ohio State 13 by Hazen all the left tackle you want to thank very much lately shman the chairman of the football committee of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses the Ohio State coach Woody Hayes any staff especially Lou McCullough who for the great aid to us their number one assistant the athletic director ed Weaver the sports information director Wilbur snip third down free to go for Stanford quarterback ROG implicit fumbled the ball hasn't we got something going here with a forward lateral which I think they have ruled flag down that's right black latterly ball forward Steve Jeff is on the tariff injured dan white recover the fumble and trying to ladder laughs he pitched it forward number 79 jump is up he's alright he goes out that's an illegal forward pass miss buck the signal being given the penalized to the 13 yard line his first time for a IO State they have possession with 2 minutes of 36 seconds remaining no curtains talking about the job that John sandy was able to do holding off Jim still wagon Denis Sheehan who has replaced Sandy in there has been doing a tremendous job to that met a chance to point in his name out since he got into the ball game it's agofsky the Janne wife wife is a 25 and in the 28 yard line of Ohio State Jack Schultz number 44 hit him first they've already announced in the press box that Jim Plunkett receives the Helms award the most valuable player of this 1971 Rose ball game so that caps off a phenomenal career for Jim Plunkett voted this year the outstanding college player in America he won so many awards that we couldn't put all the credits up on the screen for him today the awards he's won and he winds up a Stanford career that probably is the most brilliant individual career and history of Stanford football get it with a clutch performance today first down I think Kyle the outstanding thing of this game is Ohio State had just murdered everybody in the second half and yes Stanford out Plato out state in a second half today this has been pretty much an entire Pacific eight conference affair all of the Pacific eight coaches who were in the area I think Amen to lend assistance to John Ralston if there's anything they could do to help out state under 28 stanford leading 27 or 17 mace radowsky throwing deep beautiful that flag is down there's a flag down man white making a spectacular grab while waiting for this ruling we can watch the Jan white glowing downfield lady pass receiver for Ohio State covered by Betty Barnes and there's a great twisting catch but it'll be fall back against Ohio State they've dropped that flag deep in the secondary I wonder if it's offensive pass interference mostly I think it is often see pass interference as you follow the receiver on the route we threw the flag offensive pass interference against Ohio State push the ball back on the Ohio State 14 they lose the down is second down and 24 yards to go for Ohio State Mesa be lobbing a deep again head over the head number 82 Jankowski Jim Kaufman covering him a minute 57 will be switching right after the final gun here to the Orange Bowl for Nebraska Louisiana State well you won't see the pandemonium that'll break loose by stamping as this will turn out to be perhaps the greatest victory of Stanford's football history you killed your team the Stanford team this year when they have the big one they had to win they want it you get they lost three games with the donkey pass and I think they've called that to Zelena completed a 29 yard line of Ohio State Stanford defeated Arkansas there we also want to thank the Stanford coach John Ralston and his staff Johnny Ralston of the age of 43 about to score the biggest victory of his career the athletic director Chuck Taylor sports information director Bob Murphy third down 11 for Ohio State Nate sadowski's pass just misses Dan White who was open at the

  "transcript": "everybody I'm Larry veal welcome to ESPN classics presentation of college football bowl games we now present highlights from the 1971 Rose Bowl between Stanford and Ohio State behind Heisman Trophy winner Jim Plunkett Stanford would defeat the Buckeyes 27:17 win the first of two straight Rose Bowls after that at 1:00 Eastern Time Florida takes on Notre Dame in the 1992 Sugar Bowl and thank you for watching ESPN Classic it's only a few minutes by western jet commuter to Los Angeles but this has been a trip three years in the making Stanford realizing a goal that began in 1968 when Jim Plunkett first started quarterbacking the Indians head coach John Ralston and his mates gaining the Pasadena bid for the first time since the 1951 team it'll take more than a tribal war dance by Prince Lightfoot to turn back Ohio State today as Steve Horowitz kicked off to Ohio State the Buckeyes knew the Notre Dame had upset Texas in the Cotton Bowl the nation's number one ranking was within grass only Stanford remained as an obstacle 10 plays into the game the Buckeyes get their first pay stub at Stanford defense fronted by the famed Thunder chickens a major factor in the tribe's Pasadena trip after John Brockington fails on 3rd and one quarterback Rex Kern meets the same fate as Greg Sampson stops turn on fourth down at the Indian 41 the tribe takes over Plunkett going to the tick bag on the first play which surprise starter Eric cross at frankerz Dennison to rock the Buckeyes back on their heels the first time Stanford gets the ball cross running a reverse and goes 41 yard first antenna Theo hi Oh state eighteen is Plunkett poses first Rose Bowl paths touched down to Bob Moore but the Buckeyes get a big break and Stanford cheers turned to groans as the officials call it back a penalty nullifying the TD fighting off such adversity Plunkett takes matters into his own hands his quarterback draw penetrates the Buckeye interior for 13 yards and added to it an Ohio State penalty the Indians are inside the 5yard each comes tough in here as our field cameras shows Jackie Brown stopped for no gain but if you can't run it through then he says Brown run it around them and with the help of a Dan Lightfoot Block Brown finds the Buckeye endzone we'll watch again as the Buckeyes yield only their fifth touchdown on the ground all season it took Stanford only five plays to go 59 yards and they're ahead of the Buckeyes before the game is five minutes old Horowitz adds the extra point in Ohio State mode they've got a battle on their hand but Stanford defensive pressure is too much for the Buckeyes again Ron Rachel stopping Leo Hayden for a loss of four and the Indians take over at their 48 Plunkett to the air again an Ohio State learns firsthand why the Stanford quarterback is the Heisman Trophy winner first the pass to Bob Moore for 17 then to de miel Washington 411 and that's the Jackie Brown but Buckeye safety man Jack Tatum is ready attacks and Brown fumbles Hillary Shockley saves it for Stanford though and the Indians have it at the Ohio State 19 after three pathways back to the ground Jim Merrill for the Buckeye thirteen Plunket under pressure the buckeyes calling on 17 starters and 29 seniors off the Rose ball team of 1969 the one that beat OJ Simpson in the Southern California Trojans sophomores then but seasoned veterans now Plunkett taking aim on Randy pitamaha in the end zone just out of reach but a field goal is within reach of Horowitz a 37yard bullseye and Stanford has attended nothing lead eight minutes into the game the first time this season the Buckeyes had trailed by that margin and they don't take it lightly curtain pitches on a reverse to Bruce Jenkins key who gets up a head of steam for 37 yards before Dave Tipton with one of his 15 Rose Bowl tackles stops Jankowski at the Stanford 28 why was Rex Kern rated the number one quarterback in Ohio state history watch colonel running twisting only thing but fumbling as tipton again breaks up the play the ball outofbounds in buckeye possession moments later on the third try again Stanford's goal line defense Brockington smashes through for the touchdown at ground level the TD from the Stanford end zone is brockington the alltime Buckeye ground gainer puts Ohio State on the scoreboard Fred SRAM converts to make a ten to seven and what guys think the trip West was worthwhile after all Stanford leading by three points and back to the attack Plunkett growing to brown but the tribe has to give up the ball Curren makes it hurt the game's top ground gainer rattling off another 32 yards down to the Stanford 23 Kurt Goudy and taro are going to the second period now Ohio State has the ball on a Stanford eight yard line with a third and six at Ohio State I played in the first seven or eight minutes of the game has come back they have run 26 plays to Stanford for 15 and they're starting to assert their ball control game now 29 seniors here today for Ohio State 13 of them started as sophomores two years ago an unbelievable sophomore class we had six of those thirteen sophomores have made allamerican they have too many better sophomore classes they had here two years ago our graduating seniors third down and six Rex Kern a quarterback out of the wishbone T turn pitching the GAO boys and their following time on the officials they may want a measurement but a tough decision for the Stanford defensive unit they can't afford to let turn cut that ball back up inside because the visibility to run as we've already seen in this ball game and then when they force him he makes the pitch job is that outstanding running from a number of his backs Hayden's Brockington Galvez whomever might be in the trailing position Ohio State now and the Stanford three inches to go digging in with that goal line defense let's turn the leading ball carrier in the game the quarterback asked the crowd to quiet down there on the regular tee this means the belly series gonna run now rocky no maybe the yard and a half line John Brockington ice quick getting off that mark is Niko Ellie's one of those we mentioned he has that type of power not only to right up the middle or off tackle as we've seen but also outside also goes for Hayden do very unusual backs both goodsized boys brought against to 1618 208 pounds my name is Faris Rojas mate first and goal on the Stanford two yard line I'll stay started just drive on their 45 they browned out with a meat grinding off its nine plays there they're back to their old game staying on the ground I started out by throwing the ball it is number 53 Brian Donovan blocking right in front another good block from Dave Cheney you see Brockington diving over 55 yards in 10 plays for Ohio State we're now dominating campa\u00f1a will hold let's RAM will attempt Manas took this gun so action will continue here at the Rose Bowl the score now is Ohio State 14 Stanford Ohio State stand white will kick off notice he's going to boot from the fire hash marks he has that toe tied up looks like he hit that thing real hard he would puncture the ball with that front cleat background dem marrow and Jim Coughlin Eric crosses not backward he's their best kick returner jackiebrown we are deep in hands on it attend the 11 cross was upfield the wonder he wasn't back there in the goal line he was up there to get a reverse 20 yards upfield in the short lineup and show y'all how state is dominating now they've run over twice as many plays as Stanford Ohio State goes on the defense Stanford will put the ball in play down there 11 yard line go far Jim Plunkett is 4 out of 8 for 44 yards they haven't done much in the ground except for one run by air across a 43yard gonna reverse out of a split backfield Plunkett his receiver about Fatah ha fell down on the 16 he still made the grab in front of Jack Tatum ran Deva Taha who leads Stanford and pass receiving caught 48 he's got you've ever seen Jerry Levias play who's the plainest immunity Milton hunter is very much like him he's small but he has great movie explodes off the line and stop and then change direction second down five to go damper died her 16 the draw play to stop cold in the 15yard line that Jordan Hayes and all number 70 the sophomore they have to sophomore tackles up front Ohio State now it's third down and five what could have to figure something out welcome 18 touchdown passes this year completed 53% holds the alltime MCE a passing record and career total yardage record over 7,500 yards and passing 7800 yards for total often see all time good protection for him that pass has completed while he laid that man right in there Don lamb Connie look at number 68 Jim still wagon that's the protection Curt was talking about they're putting two men on him John sandy and either guard Harold Smith on the right or Lightfoot on the right leather and Smith on the left they can watch more going out number 19 Don lamb for trying to defend against it that's what you look for in a tight end like more he can outwrestled it for that ball big and strong first down Stanford on the road 24 they're going to the passing game again great protection the Pass look out go play Shepard by Jack Tatum who timed his break was dashing in there lifted out of bound Plunket apparently lost sight of him for a moment he could have thrown the ball a little sooner gave Kate him time to move into position you'll always see Kate him on the open side of the field de Bebek the end 83 on the open side and the linebackers stand wide on the wide side of the field they have the greatest pursuit of speed Tatum the Ohio State as an offensive star and has never played a play on offense second down ten for Stanford under 24 they're trailing 14 defend the Cata flips is on and complete they were blitzing the safety man Simpson ball Mike sense of awe came deep in a flips after it and we thought that Ohio State will start to put some Blitzers on but they're still protecting you saw you saw her quickly Plunkett threw it he saw the there's number three Mike since the ball came off a broken ankle early in the season led the team in interceptions with seven there he is on a blitz Plunkett picked it up but Shockley the fullback didn't third and ten now Jim Plunkett a six out of 12 on the Stanford 24 reset the backfield

colleagues at Lebanon its team doctors agree there's no known drug which helps a player to perform better despite a lot of rumors you heard about naturally these doctors warned against the use of illegal drugs by all young people that drug scene isn't smart or cool it's dangerous and destructive get a high on sports not on drugs coming wide at the 40 gam caste the and they're using him coming around today as twice he's got the ball off the end position and Bernie Barnes made the stop on him Dennis Moore playing that very smartly they linebacker right side for Stanford coming back forcing Jankowski second down six To Go Ohio State under 44 they were stunned early in this game they were behind 10 to nothing just like they were here two years ago against USC but now they rally to go ahead the pitch out rich gavel is dropped by Jack Schultz who's a great rugby player stanford has the best rugby team in america in college it's a club team their tilts said I used to hear all the yelling over there in Pasadena at New Year's Day I didn't know what it was about now find out he lives just a few blocks reared from this Rose Bowl stadium on the 47 yard line of Ohio State a third

short by a half yard now will they gamble with a 14 to 10 lead and a powerful ground at that Jeff seaman the middle linebacker and Jack Schultz the safety man stop let's turn let's turn his carrot of all eight times he is a leading ball carrier in this game he gained 66 yard Woody Hayes pointing on turn looking to woody like what he wants a measurement it looks like it's about 4 to 6 inches away from that first down marker the timeout they want that's their second timeout that they've been char there a college team allowed four and a half 952 to go and a half and actually will continue here at the Rose Bowl the score Ohio State 14 Stanford 10 and now we return you to our studios for this message a hundred and fifty years ago frontiersman traded with the Indians on this land and

down a foot to go Ohio State will gamble at the 50yard line they're leading 14 to 10 and they have it John Crockett and goes for the Stanford 46 he was knocked down by Jeff seaman Stanford's middle linebacker a junior Bakersfield California by Allstate now on a Stanford 46 last three times they've had this ball here just driven driven 65 yards and 10 plays the last time for a touchdown 65 yards or seven plays a time before they're found that opening turning darts through to the Stanford 39 turn looking at that defensive alignment saw Jeff seaman they metal linebacker move over to the strong side of it formation which left Larry Butler last ditch to spread out there as the two defensive tackles and that was the opening the current Chuck Ohio State has run off 34 plays the staffers 21 let's turn on all state and free sports at Lancaster Ohio High School there was a valley series he runs with people who go to the 45 21 he's been the outstanding player in this game so far no doubt about it he's gonna have a hundred yards on the ground before the first half is over you can see it again faking to his fullback Brockington pulling the ball right out see 92 seam in the middle linebacker coming over getting a good block turn again pulling loose from tackles strong runner 44 Jack Scholes trying to bring him down 8:40 to go in the half Ohio State leading 14 the cam it cuts the campa\u00f1a and pate is dipped by number 29 any bars and he's dropped at the Stanford money yard line I'm campa\u00f1a a junior of Kent Ohio yes what do you hate we said he lose all these great allamericans and seniors how would he be next year very good he said we always had great material in Ohio State we get beat us because of bad coaching second down five which bounty Leo Hayden 208 founder of Dayton Ohio and it took Jim Popham the safety man helped by a better safety buddy Jack Schultz to stopping Ohio State first down on a stanford ten right now a mouse theta just too powerful here in this second period stanford cannot figure out this option offense especially they can't stop let's burn the quarterback first down not first can go doesn't matter Larry Zelena who probably is a fest allaround running back they haven't been injured Collier Cleveland Ohio he just shorted the five at second down five to go we're getting 5 6 7 8 yards in a crack rich gal Bose 33 replaces Delina 14 to 10 Ohio State ahead little over 7 minutes to play in the first half right in the ball it's not at the 4yard line number 87 Ron Pedro of Glendora California senior we now have a third down and two and a half the gold this guy started on the Ohio State 40 we have a timeout charge the Ohio State that's their third time out of this half action will continue here at the Rose Bowl the score is Ohio State 14 and Stanford 10 today they've been watching the commercial he just shows that everything at a kid sees that makes such a deep impression on his mind and they recognize me wherever they see me and they know that it's a good chicken today yet and I've got a bunch of fans there that says millions of them it's the greatest joy in the world have and I believe in the future we've got another whole generation chicken eaters coming up Kentucky Fried Chicken a real old fashioned there it is solid lectures new charger has completely restyled this all right I love a charger but a family man huh yeah I tell you what looking for economy good month yeah lots of room of course right on what do you got how about this a charger you're putting me on new Dodge Charger if your family's too young for square wheels you can't afford not to be dodge material and the Ohio State bands rocking do a little spinning wheel then the 15,000 up came here from Columbus 50 charter Blaine 102,000 on hand for the road fall beautiful afternoon here 75 degrees five minutes in one second Ohio State had a ball on his drive Woody Hayes called it his brain beam heat often around for three and a half of Stanford its third and two and a half to go for a first down as Hayden their timing pile seemed to be a little bit off when he's got earth at play a little bit it was also a sort of a deceptive type of play they'd sent one of their half backs I think it was I believe campa\u00f1a coming back around to the opposite side trying to influence a Stanford defense again Stanford has stayed pretty much in a fourman line which is a little difficult to stop those option plays they're too many openings between the four men and the way the Buckeyes offensive line is coming off that ball getting to them too quickly let's Ram will try a field goal from the staff attend the high snap Benny Barnes what's in there and block traffic so Stanford hold what's good they attack of July through the left for them rammed it to the three and a half they were stopped on two plays in a row and then they missed the field goal stanford ball on their own 20 super special weekend january 16th and 17 the Bing Crosby proam Saturday 6 to 7 p.m. Sunday a man named Lombardi the documentary on the life of Vince Lombardi for this friend of ours George Flinn on Sunday the Super Bowl pregame show special guest Joe Namath and I'll be there and then the Super Bowl ball game around the big costigan bucket it is yoga the Randy Fatah ha which is a Czechoslovakian name from Garden Grove California he wears the same number as quite a fast receiver used to wear at Stanford named Jean Washington step right into issue second down ten Stanford on her twenty let's get plunk it right now he's 7 out of 14 but free to pick um confounder 25 30 35 move he's not a while scrambler but he can make it move it on the ground what still wagon 68 sandy just turning him to the right and here comes flunking up that little gap number 75 Bill Myers turning out on his block picking up 62 Terrell Smith the left guard there goes Plunkett taking advantage of that tremendous charge by still wagon that's why still wagons come in there and maybe overcommitted himself down they moved him out with a trap well he's so aggressive they're trying to take advantage of his strength by letting him overshoot the plate that was one way to do it want to learn the quarterback draw earlier Jack Brown to the 45 on Stanford where Jim still wagon hit him go Agra was second on this snapper team when tackles with 92 Stan white there right linebacker let Mount Vernon Ohio still wagon is about as quick a defensive line minister or how state's ever had number 68 he's the alignment of the year of everybody on the Outland Trophy Award second down eight Stanford under 45 a trailing 14 to 10 there's a flipside and he tried to load it there's a flag down sensenbach lists again from the safety position number three the allamerican safety blitz again watch him see him again you see still wagon taking off to the right to occupy sandy and Here Come since the ball and it was holding on the play like they charged it to Dan Lightfoot the right time right guard rather that one will hurt the Indians put them back on their 22 yard line from the spot of the foul they lost on that play 23 yards they now have a second down in 31 yards to go they're behind 14 to 10 they grabbed an earlier 10 nothing lead when they shot the Ohio State but Ohio State came right back a team that never seemed to lose the Toigo hardly Stanford to come from behind second down 31 in the Stanford 22 five minutes to go in the home that's complete for the 37yard lines with Tamiya Washington to split in Barry Howard right on top of him one thing about their safety red dog that we've been talking about we've seen Mike since ABAB Ohio State so effectively executing is that the quarterback sees the safety man blitzing the receivers also have to be aware of it looking in I'm sure that the plunking will be talking to his receivers to be looking for that red dog so they can expect that ball a little quicker cut their pass rod a little shorter third and 16 for Stanford from their 37 right on the button 25 down boy Plunkett you couldn't throw a more perfect class than that one and he got good protection excellent protection from Smith Lightfoot sandy there he goes strong arms you can see I'm working again on number 28 Harry Howard curling right around lassiter now replaces Jamil Washington who's taught two in a row burst down Stanford on the Ohio State 31 jock Lee and Jackie Brown set behind Blunkett Lassiter set to the right but Taha to the left forked on the apt in the brown Ron gets away from survived on the Stanford 11 since the ball had a crack in miss Dean and found out Rani and there was a little twist the bucket option play Jim Plunkett on the 14 they say steppedup first down for Stanford on the Ohio State 14 Jim Plunkett is 9 out of 16 a momentary hole they go to the thin as Hilary Shockley go down around the goal line is their best runner George Hayes in Hall number 70 Garfield Heights Ohio stopping help by Stan white of chin Ohio Shockley gained the most yards of any Stanford runner this year 622 yards on the 10yard line of Ohio State second and six there are three minutes and 20 seconds to go and a half Ohio State leading 14 to 10 and driving to the 12 as Hilary Shockley again number 38 number 67 Ralph Holloway and Mark de Bewick the end Stanford is converted to the first down twice out of four time four out of eight versus Ohio State Chad Williams is coming in at tackle John Ralston with his clipboard there's Williams getting in there in a goal line defense on the 8 yard line is third down now and four to go and it's double and look like at Ohio State recovery Ohio State fall since the ball fell on at number three Bob Moore on him bound and tied in the round funnel it since the ball recovered the stop the Stanford Drive on the 12 or 13 yard line of Ohio State Stanford has fumbled three times and lost once they have not had a pass intercept until they've had only one turnover my estate hasn't hasn't turned the ball over one turn on the pits out the calvo's nearly a bad pitch out when he's absolutely twentytwo for Dave Tipton the safety man coming up talkin healthy Tipton 76 he played out magnificent game up front for Stanford so far Ohio State on their 22 with a second down on the yard to go two minutes to go in the first half Ohio State leading 14 to 10 Hayden to the 24 yard line or a first down Ohio State again is Tipton and Jeff seaman the middle linebacker the see if Stanford alters their defensive alignment at all they've been in a 43 defensive set most of the ballgame fact all of the ballgame with the pennant 48 the clock running burn throwing deep over the head of genpou ski number 82 Jankowski being covered by number 21 Charles McLeod vana hit that bomb just before the end of the half second down ten now Stanford after leading ten nothing Ohio State roll back and to long drive to take a 1410 lead well house they put on its third sustained Drive Pratt a field goal and missed it and in Stanford came back on a 72 yard drive to fumble the ball away the lien is out rich Gale Bose has gone in the Ohio State backfield second down ten Ohio State under 25 Safia split to the left up the middle they go to gym John bracketing on his 30 yard line Dennis Moore number 82 playing place of the injured demony today Sanford has asked for a timeout now they stopped the clock with a minute 26 to go and a half third down and five for a Iost eight on their 30 so action will continue here at the Rose Bowl and the score is Ohio State 14 and Stanford 10 raise your right hand repeat after me I John Brodie hi John Brodie have switched to Gillette Platinum Plus which Gillette Platinum Plus play because they shave me closer and with more comfort closer and smooth there's no wait that's how they shaved me yeah that's not the way I said it John yeah but I'm the quarterback mmhmm Gillette Platinum Plus double edge or injector with platinum smooth edges for a smoother shave show the Platinum Plus injector blades John they're smoother too huh not to mention more comfortable okay I won't mention it John let me explain something to you well sure yeah I use an antiperspirant but I still get wet I'm I guess I'm just a nervous type if your antiperspirant doesn't do what you're hired it to fire yours and hire ours right guard antiperspirant get the drying agent that really helps keep you dry stops odor there's three other kids in the band we all use different any first place if we all still get wet then fire yours and hire ours ours is right guard in the silver can it'll be third inside for Ohio State on your 30yard line they're leading 14 to 10 there's the time a minute 26 to go in the first half running it again he gets the first down Rex turn and that'll put him over a hundred yards rushing how's that for a quarterback over a hundred yards rushing and a half mile state first down on their 39 104 yards for Rex Kern on the ground now straight back go to the sidelines not a pound goes a tight end Jan white with an allamerican hurdler Harrisburg Pennsylvania in high school threeyear starter Ohio State under 43 second down six a minute 13 to play we talk about the southern bath something for Stanford to worry about for going past records fix without rights foot stuck in the gobball so turn that corner and goes into Stanford territory in a Stanford 48 it's another Ohio State first down with a minute force I guess remaining in the half their lineup without a huddle now they have used three of their timeouts and that one is good at the 44 of Stanford to Jan white who stepped out of bounds of stop the clock so now how face been erased the clock for the goal line second and second this must be an interesting phase of football for the Ohio State team not known as a passing team and not a wideopen team to face a situation where they have to go the length of the field with the clock running out on them burn pitching here's an option pass Cowboys destroyed D incomplete pass was intended for Jankowski the split in 82 what he Hayes it about to send to play in if I out state do you see the number of plays they run up 49 at 28 for Stanford my information is correct that's the first pass gal Bose has thrown this season have a third down now in sixth to go with 50 seconds remaining in the half turn Stanford by Bill Alexander number 72 a senior of San Diego they have a fourth and eleventh Ohio State Stanford has time to stop the clock there are your first downs 13 to 8 let's recap what's happened in this game Ohio State got the ball was stopped they tried a first down on a Stanford 39 yard line after a drive Stanford stopped them took over then Stanford 159 yards with Jackie Brown going over for a touchdown three yards out one could have passed for a touchdown and who exactly that was call back Dan forgot the ball again and ripped Ohio State up on Plunkett's passing they were finally stopped in the Ohio State 26 and Steve Horowitz kicked a 37yard field goal but Ohio State but fell behind USC of the Rose Bowl here by an identical 10 nothing score came back on a 65 yard seven play drive rocket and plunging over that came back again in a 65 yard 10play Drive rocket and plunging over and they lead 14 to 10 now a confirmation Lego is a confirmation each team they want fun previous to this a fair catch call at the 19 yard line by Eric cross 27 seconds here in this change of possession the clock will not start until the snap of the ball 31 yard kick from scrimmage 27 seconds remaining in the half Ohio State ahead 14 again Herr pastor of Plunkett's caliber that's I would say not ample time but he could certainly do it in that amount of time to see what type of defensive alignment Ohio State comes up with there inside of the threeman rush month it is 9 out of 16 in passing for 113 yards that's a low and usual article average he draws it the Shockley who brings it out to the 29 yard line dan lamp kadar lamp get defensive back brought him down and Stanford calls time to stop the clock with 18 seconds to go where they'll have a second down and a yard to go Jim Plunkett is only the second Heisman winner to play in the Rose Bowl the year he won the Heisman Trophy the first one was OJ Simpson in 1968 and there's Plunkett talking to a Stanford sideline and as Woody Hayes pointed out prior to the game interesting change for them Ohio State faced Simpson in that 68 game facing a great runner this time they're facing a great passer that look like they've changed my home state hasn't changed much they show as strong as ever on defense it's very frank about it was Nick Talley said we didn't stop Oh Jay Simpson Cole but we contain him some and we want we don't expect to stop Jim cluck at all but we accept to containing something that went again than I won once it fires it out of bounds and he does a bring that ball van white a linebacker number 88 the pass was intended for Randy but AHA and Ohio State has another shot now with 10 seconds to go in the half there's some furious and fast talking on the sideline there with Woody Hayes and Rex Kern is the parent leaves to go out onto the field what type of play what type of attack to go with just ten seconds remaining that's the first interception for Plunkett in the game was averaged only one interception every 20 pass of this year first down at Ohio State in the Stanford 35 the clock is moving now burn fires and he's got Hayden but he misses it mattifies the four seconds to go many barns with chasing Leo Hayden down that sideline turn is attempted three out of six for 29 yards but don't look at that look at his ground gaining today net 99 he was over 104 now it's down to net 99 for a half 99 for a game is a good hallmark for any running back now State has run off 51 place the Stanford 29 this may be the last play of a half that's trying to be turns pass no good that's the last play of the first half well there they go both teams getting by innovations on the near side here on the house they can the far side of Charles McCloud goes off at Stanford Indians and they're just gone halftime a very interesting first half with Stanford dominating in the early part of a game and Ohio State taking control in the second quarter and then when it looked like Stanford was fading they came back on a beautifully executed 72 yard drive only the fumble of all the way down near the Ohio State goal line and as long as I have Jim Plunkett throwing they're gonna be dangerous here in the second half but Ohio State in the second half this year has scored 158 points to the opponents 36 and in the third period alone they racked up 90 points to their opponents nine points well they're a team that seems to punish the opposition wear them down and play their best ball in the second half let's see if Stanford will be able to be a good secondhalf team also we're ready to go now with our halftime show the ohio state university marching band directed by paul joseph a hundred and fifty band members a hundred and twenty of these occurring on the field 30 on the sidelines to handle a prop the back resolve it and how we switch you over they're all pilots marching that too soon because computers helped us step out on the moon and drills should click to perfection and leave directors lazy for a lack of direction a computer can react to people with unpredictability or hate once they've punched into their program ha ha bends spindle or mutilate now we'll have to whip it into shape by hand which shows only humans can lead a band dating by computer is becoming quite the thing which rhymes with fling and claim and ring and then with offspring but Priscilla shunned her print out of a suitor and said speak for yourself you cute computer we've said it full of fact and fiction and asked if not to be absurd but please to unwind a prediction and here it comes a fourletter word hioh states leading at halftime 14 to 10 and halftime activities will continue from the 1971 Rose ball game after we pause for station identification Auburn meets Ole Miss the Gator Bowl tomorrow afternoon

  "transcript": "71 another exclusive presentation of ABC Sports NCAA football today's game features the Nittany Lions of Penn State undefeated and ranked fifth in the nation against the volunteers of Tennessee after a day of cold miserable weather here in Knoxville Tennessee it is bright crisp as today the volunteers of Tennessee are hosting the hottest team in the East that's right Penn State the Nittany Lions from State College Pennsylvania have not been defeated in 15 straight games they're noted for their winning streaks they're coached by Joe Paterno they have a record of 10 and oh this year we have Tennessee the volunteers defeated only twice this year one point by Harborne and again by Alabama but Wilkinson is here he'll battle the Tennessee coach at one time was on Bud staff at Oklahoma and but has been a great friend of Joe Paterno as I have for many many years and but it's most unusual to have two such young bright coaches heading major schools Chris I think are the people who carry on the college football tradition defend the great coaches the years rocked Neelu little and I won't take time to list all the rest of them but these records are just unreal no battles is nineteen and three and his two seasons Jill Paterno is fifty two victories ten losses and one tie they play great offense great defense and more important they utilize the material extremely well Parsons was a quarterback he's now a tight end for Penn State for example they also do a great job in instilling leadership not only the quarterbacks these two coaches in particular because their philosophy of young people and their contribution that's necessary in the future that's why I've such high respect for both of them there are teams are gonna be very exciting to watch also Penn State is got a very powerful running attack they've had two weeks to get ready for this game and they're gonna have a new offensive wrinkle instead of being in the I formation we expect to see them in the wing T some this afternoon which will give them very powerful blocking on the corner position and will cause Penn State to adjust the defense and play in a little bit unusual positions and it will be very interesting to see how they make the adjustment and how successful is Penn State change is going to be against one of the best defensive teams in the country Tennessee is giving up only more than one touchdown one time and that was against Alabama first meeting between Penn State and Tennessee ever 55\u00b0 the sun is shining and it's shining on our colleague bill Fleming ladies and gentlemen the lineups for Tennessee this is the offensive team at school from Savannah Tennessee number 90 Joel Thompson from Brownsville Tennessee number 73 Galen Hill left guard to Winchester number 65 Phil Fulmer Turner from Cleveland Tennessee number 53 time Johnson's a right guard from Cleveland Tennessee number 64 bill em in Norfolk play tackle from Barstow number 76 Joe ball fro side am from Louisville Kentucky number 20 Gary feller at quarterback in Nashville number 16 Jim Maxwell tailback from Winchester Tennessee number 36 bill rudder at wing back from Nashville number 43 Jorge Silva a pull back from Knoxville number 41 Steve chances injured today and who will not play from Crossville Curt Watson and the head coach the volunteers bill battle good luck those of the lineups go back to christen blood on our television booth the pregame activities have been concluded we'll be back for the opening kickoff here at Neyland Stadium in Knoxville Tennessee so it'll be Tennessee in the orange jerseys if you're watching in color that will be receiving the kick as the wind is blowing in from the far side of the fielder from an easterly direction at about five miles an hour and as we indicated earlier the temperature is 55 degrees and here we look at the Tennessee offensive line the ends are Joe Thompson number 90 and the tight end of the coin a gary filer Tom Johnson is the offensive center with Amador performer the tackles Hill and bought through rather the tackles and fuller and hemmond offer the guards even darker a standout player number 64 while in the backfield at quarterback it'll be senior Jim Maxwell from Nashville and Steve Chauncey bill Rutter's to the fullback and the wing back will be George Sylve kicking off for Penn State will be Alberto video low there he is only five feet seven inches to know where's the big number 37 on the white jersey and if you're watching a bursty mitten eli and blue and it'll be Penn State putting their perfect record on the line against Tennessee the volunteers hoping to be the spoilers this afternoon as Bobby majors number 44 and 41 Steve Chauncey our deep chanting to the far side of the field majors one of the great kick returners in the country great athlete number 44 over 60,000 the seventh consecutive home game that the crabs exceeded over 60 and the side boot now is going right down the middle of the field it's taken by number 44 Bobby majors out for the 1500 he find a hole funny he's got it oneonone that was his duking and moving his feet was not quite grin enough and was brought down by number 22 John cappelletti also Jim Scott was the first one to hit him beautiful blocking by the Tennessee line they used that cross block up the middle and you can see the great hole that majors had he broke absolutely into the clear except for the safety man Penn State in a good pattern to keep him from going all the way a 57yard opening kickoff return at the 40 of Penn State the ball goes quickly out to bill rudder the fullback trying to get outside and the lateral movement of the Penn State defense which is pretty super they're a classic group of guys as Greg Duke at Keeseville New York makes the tackle but the Penn State defense is a fourfour and they only use three men in the deep secondary Tennessee hopes to stretch that three deep today most games have an option of going to four deep if they're getting three wide receivers Penn State does not like to do that we'll see wide receivers the perhaps three of them ending the time from Tennessee charlie is a packer number 60 you're looking at was limping as we got a first pass at the ball game from the 37 it is out of at about the 29 Joe Thompson from Savannah Tennessee forced out by buddy Ellis Mary Thompson a 6footer who this year has caught 12 passes one for a touchdown and you can see Thompson running the quick out against Ellis Bill battles the Tennessee coach thought that the half backs for Penn State play a little bit deep on that they gave a little bit more room in front and perhaps they could afford to give up and they'll do with those quick outs quite a bit of the time Jorge Silva the far side of the field first down from the 29 Tennessee with a ball nice boy it was one leg and bow there you go good job by Joe Thompson two for two Maxwell as a fact when we said was limping around forced him out of bounds this is Thompson again running the simple square out let's watch his feet and I guess he has that one foot inside the line of college football that's all you need and both football you need to have both of them in all right back to back first downs on two passes going to the far side of the field Gary Tyler's is put in from the 18 yard line of Penn State Tennessee on the ball tipped all in the play carrying to the 14 steep chance a pump in sit output clearly in Penn State's favor they need four yards for a first down on third down to the 12 yard line Kent State no score Tennessee with the ball so a the Tennessee hopes throttled right here as store pan was in on George Sylvie Sylvie on the fumble score pan recovers it no Penn State takes over now we'll look at an offense there are a classic group colorful as well a team that has scored over 44 points per game they could do a lot of things but including rushing and passing and that was a threepoint fumble George hunt number nine and Tennessee field goal kickers one of the best in the country I believe he could have put the three points in the world from the 21 at Penn State first down up Nagel handing off to Franco Harris from Mount Holly New Jersey number 34 he'll be carrying the ball the left today at least in the pregame plans by Joe Paterno there you see Bob Parsons ball up to 24 now second down and seven Cole is set to the far side of the field from the eye muscles long as flags are down as live Dell Mitchell got the ball number 23 we were talking before the game Chris with these two teams be up for this one both having clinched goal bids I think it's very apparent that they really are Penn State the two anxious jumping left side illegal procedure oh it's five yards down remain facility for 60,000 fans watching now going to the far side yeah Bob Rickenbacker and Lynn cold 40 and 48 linear back michael has stopped right at the line of scrimmage by Conrad Graham there's thirty four and white that's Harris and Jamie rotella number 57 Tennessee his pioneered a new type of defense they've taken the basic five to four pattern and then drop the middle guard in this case rain nettles when 258th back off the line of scrimmage so they're three free line backers that gives you a tremendous variety of stunts by those three men difficult for the offensive line to pick up course you saw that the Tennessee defense is pretty tough third and 11 for Penn State from the 20 brings up a fourth down now Lydell Mitchell's a record breaker three NCAA records 12 penn state records he is stuff they are short of a first down with the ball at the 22 it brings up a fourth down at nine and bobby majors number 44 the majors family honored just before the kickoff and perhaps you saw it on college football today our pregame show and they have contributed so much to the football interest in the state of tennessee bob parsons former quarterback noun in will punch Bearcats called for by bobby majors at his own 40yard line so after a fumble Penn State was only able to move the ball one yard and force the punt on fourth down that punt with 38 yards the timeout at Neyland Stadium in Knoxville to score Penn State nothing and if you're still watching black and white TV RCA can make it a whole new ballgame with Excel 100 100 percent solid state a cue color TV over 40 models made with circuitry designed for extended life each chassis tube is replaced by tough reliable solidstate devices color TV made to last XL 100 from RCA after a fine defensive effort by Tennessee the punt went to the volunteers now they have a 1st and 10 at the Tennessee 40 Maxwell is the quarterback number 16 makes it to the deep back pick it out he is 4 for corn as you seen nearly enough for a first down coming up near the midfield stripe Chauncey number 41 pulling it in as we look at smokey the bluetick coonhound the mascot of the volunteer finally the defense excuse me bud for Penn State Fannin Aaron hold and Hillier and Vlasov X are up front the linebackers there's a pack Colin gray deep Ellis for van Duke cat and miss zhuo second down and 1 first down for the volunteers bill Rutter the sophomore fullback from Winchester Tennessee makes the yardage but Penn State's going out of there for 4 into the 61 defense but they get it right straight up the middle very well the sticks now they're going against Tennessee and from the 46 and Penn State first down mass over dawn intended for number 20 Gary Tyler from Louisville Kentucky 2nd down and 10 coming up for the score in the game 951 to go 1st quarter there you see the comparative scores and the opponents Tennessee passing over 22 points a game they have allowed only 97 in in 10 days it was their defensive unit bud and the only team to score more than one touchdown against the mount of animal of those 32 points and only Alabama has scored against the Tennessee defense in the first quarter here's the second exam a great deal to do with Steve Chauncey not being able to hang on Penn State defense on the mountain they have allowed only two touchdowns rushing ten touchdowns passing here's a third and ten passing situation great catch Gary Fowler Wow and cuz that's what I was talking about stretching those three deep they have three wide receivers that makes three people covered the entire field let's watch Tyler in the isolated camera he's a flex 10 here he comes off the line of scrimmage and he's running that post pattern breaking past gray into the middle there's a lot of real estate out there for three men to cover they knew the pass was coming great catch formation from the 31 at Penn State first down Tennessee no score carrying on the play was bill rudder and as you saw in the introductions by bill Fleming an alltime Tennessee ball carrier Watson the senior fullback from Crossville Tennessee injured not even suited up and it's too bad you couldn't see him play today because he's had a great career here Jim Heller on the tackle Tennessee's record the last three years under Bill battle 28 wins five buck Doug Dickey of course was included in one year battle two of those three years and when will they drop off the cover next one now has thrown seven times completing five third down in 20 from the 41 Steve Chauncey number 41 extra point conversions he's a native of Clearwater Florida is a senior six one 215 pounds and he's going to need everything he has 53 yard attempt from the 43 plus 210 of the endzone when we were last here Tennessee playing Auburn he did kick a 50yard field goal but he was short on this 53 yarder as a VC in the NCAA combined to bring you the thrills of college football with time out to score and stake nothing gonna see nothing Tennessee 6th and scoring defense has controlled the ball five and a half minutes to Penn State one minute and 59 seconds then the Lions have it now at their own 20 following a missed 53yard field goal by George hunt for the first down hufnagle a loose ball Mitchell Lydell Mitchell on the pitch recovered his own fumble quickly in on the play was number 59 Carl Johnson a defensive end Rickon back in Parsons who has shifted or the wing back was most effective on the play by Dell Mitchell who scored 28 touchdowns this year second and 17 model number 23 from Salem New Jersey carried on the play one of the ten work on the play rotella and Jackie Walker one of the two allamericans on a Tennessee to the other being Bobbie majors while for Penn State they've joined her an offensive tackle number 70 he's the right tackle he comes up in the line now and Lydell Mitchell the other All America we have a third down and nine Nagle taking it to Mitchell taking it outside and that's the basic play of the Penn State offense the fake to Mitchell and up Nagel keeping the ball beautifully kick majors calling for a fair catch at his own 35 you can help here's how send five dollars today to Olympic House box ba 57 Park Avenue New York New York from the 35 Tennessee no scoring the game first down what a wall bill Rutter ran into can see gives it the third effort and gets to the Penn State 30 Tom Hall on the tackle and a great job at uh key signal by Maxwell he saw Penn State ready to give it that big rush that was effective the trap Maxwell in the last possession if they gave it that rush and he broke past the rushing men he was in the clear 31 yard by Steve Chauncey the sophomore his hometown right here in Knoxville so from the Penn State 31 first and 10 Tennessee 5 minutes first quarter no score comes in to the near side of the field Thompson coming back the ball was deflected however an almost full a marker down interference coming up at about the six yard line it's going to be offensive interference it appears misko piccata the to Penn State men who come across and see if we can see whether Thompson pushes both of them here and it appears to me that he really had Running Room he's unable to take his course but the referee saw differently he was behind the play though it's third down and twenty five for Tennessee and their third opportunity to get some points on the board hauled it as a result of a penalty as Rutter carried on the play field to kept the safety man will come over as does Chuck miss Coe and Thompson is entitled to run his course and it appears to me here that the two Penn State people cut across in front of him and keep him from running this course the official who called it was at the bottom of your screen Bobby nature's punted going out about that may be a very effective one Bobbie majors the allamerican from Suwannee Tennessee only a 32 yard punt but it went out of bounds at approximately the eighth time out here at Neyland Stadium in Knoxville the score Penn State nothing the Jefferson Browns the Chiefs and Colts the Giants and bears the bite wounds and patterns the Rams from Cowboys NFL electric football you start the action with two complete teams like the Rams and Cowboys in their own colorful uniforms NFL electric football by Tudor we had an offensive interference call against Tennessee a little earlier and we like to play it once more for you mrs. Thompson trying to break between the cat and Mexico and they cut him off so that he's not able to get between them and you can see now why the official at the bottom of the screen called to play because as he sees it right here it looks as though Thompson is pushing both of them actually he was sort of cut off at the pass from the 7 yard line following a Bobby majors front its first and 10 for Penn State and one of the powers of the nation's football majors and state by del Mitchell number 23 carrying on the play Jackie Walker the allamerican linebacker on the tackle thus far penn state 14 total yards no first downs and we have 3 minutes and 18 seconds remaining in the first quarter they've also had miserable field position on the exchange the 21 the 20 in their own eight second down and eight now from the nine the deep back by Bill Mitchell we were talking before the game about first down for Penn State on offense being one of the keys to victory the first down snaps thus far Penn State made for they lost seven and they made two so Tennessee doing a good job of shutting the Long Pond first down to implement long yardage coming up on second Rickett back is in the lineup now number 44 Penn State as they have a third down and seven Flynn poll is set to the near side number 48 from the eye up Nagel a good one completing at the Bob Parsons the crust 420 now from the 24 yard line first down Penn State in the white uniform Mitchell Mitchell spun down at about the 27 a gain of three with john directing the attack second down and six Franco has first down and in Tennessee territory for the first time from the 49 of Tennessee first down Penn State there he is again Michael Harris great career they're big strong they've got strict kickoff as the ball is snapped but soon as they kick out and then 25 to go no score here in the first quarter from the 37 first down there's rival by now to about the 23 yard line Neyland Stadium where they love their football we made the point several times Christmas the only advantage the offense really has over the defense is knowing when the ball is going to be snapped and if you can't hear the quarterback call that snap count if you lose that advantage the defense gets to use their hands and arms the offense does not so that's really where the margin the balance is between the offense and defense you've got to be able to hear the quarterback call us nest on a wing to this side of the field step backs and the splint far side in from the 20 for the Tennessee defense converges on Franco Harris and the defense includes John wagster number 67 rotella number 57 for Tennessee defensively now it's Lambert 82 Howell 83 52 Walker 58 metals 57 rotella 67 wagster 59 Johnson 40 for majors 37 Conrad 25 Brown at 13 David Allen 79 this fall and intercepted by comrade William he's got a blocker within Mitchell trying to catch him Mitchell wolf get him very tired fault Conrad Graham from winstonsalem North Carolina as the Tennessee fans go wild Baxter and Rotella help force that fumble 76 yards Tennessee lead George hunt for the point is good time had expired that that was a continuing play the punt after attempt at the end of the first quarter to score the Tennessee Volunteers underdogs seven and state nothing John cappelletti Ed O'Neill and Chuck her to wait Tennessee's kick following a 76 yard return of an intercepted fumble for a score this is the first play of the second quarter in number another Penn State fumble we still haven't seen the official designation yeah we have chris said it was down all right let's say the intercepted fumble and the 76 yard run by Graham janky walker 52 forced it he's only six feet 200 pounds one of the great land backers in college football watch him knock the ball loose here he moves in the hufnagle there goes the ball in the air Conrad Graham coming up from his corner position picks it off everybody from Penn State with the exception of Mitchell was down fee Hill that we took at 76 yards for the touchdown Vince key step to the near side as the place stays on the ground from the 29 Franco Harris or good yardage on the play now Johnson one of the Tennessee tacklers at the 34 yard line Penn State had had all the best of these statistics until that last burned me Tennessee had until that last the Penn State Drive but they still lead it a little bit 82 total yards for Tennessee against 74 Penn State time of possession slightly in the favour of Tennessee actually Penn State went 71 yards before the interception now hufnagle finds the target stars in ski nineyard gain in the backfield for Penn State 30 for Harris 48 Cole 23 Mitchell 84 skarzinski attend along with Parsons number 86 slot formation far side Wow and Penn State has changed their offensive pattern I've been operating with two tight ends most of the season as the second down of three John Hufnagel the quarterback Franco Harris coming outside to about the 44 good run and the first Dennis Harris now has carried the ball seven times for 52 yards Danny Jefferies on the tackle tumble by Conrad Graham 1320 to go 2nd quarter smegal receivers covered ought to go for the fine football player Harris number 34 yeah is a junior who has completed sixty two point six percent of his passes markers down as Mitchell carries needed three in the fight of the Southland band with a lot of pretty girls from the University of Tennessee on top was number 57 Jimmy rotella on Franco Harris number 34 34 Bob Parsons number 86 and I've got to admire the offensive patter of Penn State 234 i think everyone felt with her powerful inning attack they were gonna throw the ball up Nagle made a great fake and the crossing patter to Parsons he was wide open this Tennessee went for the play fake Graham catching him midair and going 76 yards for the Tennessee score by Dell Mitchell number 23 MSE lead seven to nothing Chuck bird in the lineup to the near side of the field number 25 not great Franco Harris losing his footing on the Tartan turf here at Neyland Stadium in Knoxville Tennessee Garth insky goes to the far side of the field on 35 Cole is also to the right up Nagle with Harris blocking not single outside Franco Harris locking for his quarterback it's Conrad grim forces helped make a lot of bounds at the 14 but first down first and 10 now from the 14 Tennessee lead seven and nothing Mitchell loss of one Walker 52 Vitelli and Carl Johnson 59 first bit of misdirection that we've had all the rest of the place has been straight ahead our night plays bagel good job at the defensive secondary covering three receivers who had gone into the end zone ten Lambert comes in on Hufnagel and brings him down turn up on ABC's Wide World of Sports at 5:00 Eastern and Pacific for Central Time international Grand Prix motorcycle championships from Elsinore California now we have a third down and 17 up they go Mitchell Mitchell out of bounds at about the 10 video low Alberto is back to try a field goal he's 4 of 12 this one will come from the 17 plus the 10 of the end zone a 27 yard kick is up and good video of Penn State mixed the field goal from 27 yards out as this is NCAA college football with time out the score Tennessee 7 Penn State 3 Penn State has scored on a field goal from 27 yards and Bobby majors and Steve Chauncey await the kick by diello from Naples Italy now living in East Meadow Long Island kicks and looking at the ball is majors coming out to the five Chauncey blocking majors gets to the 20 just another block to the 30 and he brings it back to the 41 and this is quite a day for John Bobbie major he goes Jim Scott let's watch it again see the kick that was low at bounced around I thought majors was gonna down it in the end zone here and was going to say something about how much football savvy he had he thought that blocking would be there and it was and this is one of the better open field tackles I've seen majors is great in the open field is he avoided the official and Scott took him on square and brought him down Scott got him on his opening kickoff return of 57 yards so he's done it again from the 41 a Penn State first down Maxwell Maxwell handing off to Bill Rutter the sophomore fullback to get out on the tackle as misko comes up second down and six Tennessee in the direction of Chauncey but the rush cause mix well to draw very poorly Aaron hold number 79 from his defensive left tackle position joined by the defensive right in less of a foot the rush are welcome camera crew ABC Sports well they are only welcoming the best camera crew in the world oh man thank you third down and six for Tennessee from the Penn State 37 Tennessee lead seven to three here's Maxwell in our own Jerry Gray we thought had it strike fourth and six Bobby majors to punch 750 to go in the first half and major strives for the corner goes into the end zone and through it will come out to the 20yard line from where Penn State will try to mount a drive here at the halfway point of the second quarter college football what better way to spend an autumn after doing the time up to score Tennessee 7 Penn State 3 1972 Chevelle by Chevrolet you'll find some changes like refined pollution controls for cleaner air but it still has everything that made it America's most popular midsized car Chevelle gives you big car comfort in a less expensive size so it fits more families and more budgets Chevrolet wants your new Chevelle to be the best car you ever owned Chevrolet building a better way to see the USA Penn State with a hundred and thirty five total yards and three points Tennessee 85 yards and seven points on a 76yard intercepted fumble return for the score in the last two Penn State possessions they've looked awesome they're a bigger stronger they simply have rolled the Tennessee defense back where they are 'muscular Don sheds has been a fullback number 32 from the 20 up Nagel an interception by number 13 David Allen David Allen was positioned perfectly so Tennessee gets the ball this is quite an interception because month Nagel who has thrown nine touchdown passes has been an intercepted only four times but that was five that puts in Athenian business Chris on the 15 third time they've gotten the ball in Tennessee territory twice their defense State Territory twice on great kickoff returns and this one with a fine interception George sylvie number 43 to the far side of the field as a flanker from the 15 first down Tennessee bill rudder fired up and the offensive guard Phillip Fulmer and Emin door / number 64 both upset that they didn't go all the way they opened the hole in the trap beautifully number 13 David Allen you'll intercept at the hufnagle pass and with the ball at the six it's a second down and one Thompson to the near side it shows you the toughness of the Penn State defensive front floor and their three linebackers the power i formation first and goal bill letter and that's what those extra backs black and mean for you up front Phillip Fulmer 6564 in the door / Walter up 76 Hill 73 now its first and goal from the one and a half 73 Tennessee leads Tennessee threatening here 612 to go first half Hennessey choirs getting the touchdown signaled by the nod of the official you can see him over there marking he says he missed it for inches second down and goal partisan Tennessee fans watching with you puts down hill rudder letter who's been averaging five point four yards per carry goes in for the Tennessee scores and Tennessee a big underdog in this game now has a 13 to three lead homer and Hill on the far side of the offensive line opened the hole as will have hunt now trying for his 57 58 consecutive point after him exit 5:32 of the second quarter we have a timeout here at Neyland Stadium Knoxville Tennessee the score volunteers 14 the Nittany Lions three tries to kick kickoffs very high on the air and as a result the Penn State receivers are up on the 13 yard line instead of deeper it's high in the air and horseback was Chuck heard he didn't mean to do that fist but he gave this fair catch signal pressure on you can't say that he was feeling and shilling his eyes from the Sun because the Sun was at his back I think they must have practiced the fair catch Kris because the height for the normal Tennessee kickoff and usually there are a lot of people down there and having practiced it he didn't realize how kick how deep that one was gone it was human the air I'd like to defend him her I would serve the tough spot to make a decision all right from the fiveperson 10 Penn State that was Lionel Mitchell bringing it out to about the eight or nine yard line and every series is a highly critical but this is an extremely critical series for Penn State if Tennessee can stop them here and get the ball with field position they could really get some action going Penn State has got to knock it out here I didn't understand that last sign I thought they were going to save the great second down and seven now Penn State with the ball Franco Harris as the Tennessee team is fired up eight wins two losses a onepoint loss to Auburn and Bend Alabama and scored 225 points thus far today they have 14 Penn State has a 27yard field goal Kyle Johnson making the tackle at about the 10 so it's going to be a third down and five third and five Hufnagel the quarterback of Nagaland trouble oh did he get it out of the end zone it appears he did Ken Lambert putting the pressure and a very smart move by Hufnagel he was almost trapped in the end zone he recognized where he was he just barely got it out there Tennessee is switched their defense in those those first four passes that were completed against them let's take a look at this again you can see only four men rushing now they got five men in the short zones Hufnagel tries to run he's cut off he's in the end zone and he just barely gets it out he said he was a classy performer Hufnagel fourth and 15 inches away from the goal line Bob Parsons at the end line to punch out it comes back deep bobby majors at the 45 a Penn State the 30 the 35 the 30 with that kabhi go what a day on a day that the majors family is being honored here at Tennessee oh what a team play Tennessee linemen came back and knocked everybody down they deuces this coy as the runner as I've seen because he lets the blockers work so many ball carriers overrun their blockers and he simply lets them work for him Bobbie majors with the opening kickoff of 57 yards he had another big one and this one was 45 what an afternoon the allamerican from Suwannee will show you the punt return and the great blocking by the Tennessee teammates of majors as George hunt tries for 59 straight it's up it's hard to believe let's take a look at it again every play in football is a team play much majors here he has it and now watch these straight flops they're the linemen the wall is forming they knock everybody down they over landed a little bit too there's another super block and now watch majors poised as he lets everybody work for him to get the final block on Parsons who will kick the ball and who now had become the safety man there he is and you can see Haleh Tennessee people down there on him once more he reads the blocks and that's the toys that comes from a skilled experienced football player he's a great home the reason that you see the picture juggling the folks in the upper deck where are one of our mini cameras is located is just moving along with all the upanddown movement of the fans twenty one two three the high kick is taken by Mitchell Mitchell of Penn State comes out to the 29 yard line and in two minutes following an interception by Allen Tennessee has scored twice making the tackle with art Reynolds now the college division bowl games will be next Saturday the boardwalk Bowl Delaware CW Post the Grantland rice bowl McNeese State Tennessee State the Pioneer bold Eastern Michigan Louisiana Tech of the Camellia Bowl Boise State in Chico State check your local listings for diamond telecast Mitchell sharing on the play the two minutes 24 seconds to kind of fight in the clock just a little let him bite off any big yardage there's the coach of the year 1968 Joe Paterno first and 10 from the 39 huffnagel completion to cigars in ski number 84 86 yards from the Tennessee 49 first down Mitchell Mitchell's lighting to the 45 found in six with a minute 23 to go in the first half and trailing 21 to 3 up navel Mitchell look at that Mitchell battle and they all right first and ten now at the 39 I'm running out in the first half while coming outside and in the middle everyone trying to tackle Mitchell but it was Parsons who had the ball very fine ball handling by huffnagle Lee with the clock running to snap the ball the 11th first down for Penn State up they go number 13 David Allen who has one interception today was covering skarzinski on the play for five touchdown up Hegel hiding that ball beautifully Michigan out to Harris Franco hood list for the 21 33 coming up for Penn State it's third down and three with 35 seconds to go in the first half they trailed 21 to 3 the Bombers at the Tennessee 21 from the I what formation near side early movement on the far end of the Penn State Line touchdown Tennessee as men state tries to get it first it was behind Bob Parsons number 86 on 43 yards away Steve Scully is holding oh it's opaque I snap and it's intercepted and wisely running out of bounds number 62 didn't show a lot of speed Claude Simonton I'm coming to Tennessee a junior on the clock 19 seconds in the first half and from the 32 Tennessee has the ball 1st down with Maxwell at quarterback a slot formational far side wide set backs behind Maxwell your side end is for the way to bill rudder number 36 carrying across the 35 with that call it's apparent that coach bill battles is going to win to the half with a 21 to 3 lead rather than try to put more points on the board that's the story really Tennessee lost one fellow but the two interceptions and we fumble that was intercepted in the air resulting in the Tennessee touchdown have been the difference in this half well as we look at the clock but it is stopped Tennessee apparently called a timeout they have one more remaining Bishop here kept that cracker and you always do I wish so on December 31st the Sugar Bowl New Orleans Auburn Oklahoma January 1st 2nd and 6th and cautiously a surprise first half there's a great halftime of entertainment coming up the score at Neyland Stadium in Knoxville Tennessee is Tennessee 21 Penn State 3 thanks Phil Martin Memphis Chattanooga and Nashville it's the 17th largest university in the nation it has an

Louie blues after rampart Street parade battle they see your set at home those are notes leaving the instrument and there you see the last letter of Louie filled up on the gridiron yes this has little lovely sweet music prior to the Southland then from the University of Tennessee and now just improve its versatility then concludes with more of a classical number I guess you saw it first of all we heard an original then a march by Fillmore there were some blues and now we go to Igor Stravinsky as the band will go into a clock and concert formation and play the Firebird suite the University of Tennessee pride of the southland man dr.

over and coming up next the second half the score here Neyland Stadium is Tennessee 21 and Penn State 3 thank you very much bill Beck deep now Joe Paterno has put Lydell Mitchell one of three potential receivers in George Muntz second half kickoff John cappelletti 22 is deep along with 87 Ed O'Neill cappelletti looks at the ball in the end zone and wisely with the kick coverage people coming down fast in the orange jerseys it'll be a touchback for Penn State a heavy favorite in this game to remain undefeated I are trailing 21 to 3 Penn State offensive line up as you can see Penn State is very much in the game they moved the ball very well in the first half they had a punt run back for a touchdown an interception that was caught in the air for a touchdown and another interception that gave Tennessee the ball on the 15yard line to set up those 21 points Mike bots ready to snap the ball to help Egelhoff Pangolin turn hands it off quickly to my Dell Mitchell from the 20yard line so we look at the statistics here it appears that Penn State is in charge but if you add the 223 yards of country of kick returns rather to Tennessee's total yardage that makes 330 total yards for Tennessee and that of course is not shown on those statistics second bound at 6 now for the 20 for Penn State with the ball the second play the second half outside Mitchell Mitchell moving out to about the 27 Jamie Rutt Ellie and David Allen converging on him and Allen making the play that every quarterbacks supposed to make if you don't make the tackle turn him in there's some help there if you miss him there's nobody on the outside Allen has one interception today which set up a 15yard March at five flight with rudder scoring the touchdown well recap the scoring for you at our first opportunity as Penn State has kicked a 27yard field goal mid point of the second quarter they trailed 21 to 333 Hufnagel outside the plant go Harris Jackie Walker moving laterally to force him out of bounds out to the 35 Jackie Walker moves in on the ball carrier number 23 Lydell Mitchell as we isolate on Walker Walker is the boy that forced the fumble it was caught on the air by Graham and resulted in the Tennessee touchdown watch his lateral movement here and he sets himself reads the play takes him on as square as you possibly can skarzinski for Penn State at the bottom of your screen number 84 with the ball of the 35 second down and 7 Hufnagel finds Parsons at the 42 David Allen number 13 covering Parsons 63 233 pounds and it's another Nittany Lion 37 yards first and 10 from the Penn State 4321 the three Tennessee leading what a catch at the 49 of Tennessee Glencoe love to wonder Pennsylvania seniors unwrapped Graham who scored one of the Tennessee touchdown returning an intercepted fumble made the tackle averaging 44 point 3 total yardage average 463 yards a game they are undefeated denounced a second down and two at the Tennessee 49 and getting more than enough Lydell Mitchell slot I and when things are going right they sometimes seem to continue as rain metals the leading tackler on the Tennessee defense recovers it's a new wrinkle in the Tennessee type defense metals is off the line a little bit as the middle guard here he is moving in and really just stealing the ball from Harris who didn't quite ever have control of it the fourth turnover Penn State Tennessee at their own 45 first down Maxwell calling signals a fake beautiful hole and rudder goes through and look at the pursuit of the Penn State defenders been an errand holds a pack o gray Heller less of ik Ellis Corp and Duke Kent and misko are the defenders as we look at the Tennessee forward line offensively even Penn State plays you're always vulnerable for that crap up the middle next time we're gonna see got great execution on it from their guards boomer and Inman door / from the Penn State 44 first down Tennessee with the ball Steve chance a strong on second down and nine there's Maxwell incomplete that's one of those statistics Chris that I always wonder about it goes down if the passer failed to complete it but actually hit him right in the hands three now 39 from the Penn State 43 Maxwell wide open rudder rudder inside the 35 out of bounds at about the 30 and a first down buddy Ellis covering defensively on the play number 18 and a mighty big first down because Tennessee has George chunk to one of the better field goal kickers in college football and he's now well within range George hunt missed a 53yard field goal the midway point of the first quarter then a 76 yard score by Graham following an interception a 15 yard drive with rudder scoring two minutes later a 45yard punt return by Bobby majors and a 27yard field goal for Penn State 21 to 3 Tennessee leading from the 31st down we're in the 3rd quarter Rutter Maxwell Kris checking signals at the line of scrimmage and Penn State then changing the defense jumping gray into the line after he's checked signals it's awfully hard to run that trap play against what we call the odd set where you have a man directly over the center we have 90 Thompson second and seven intended for the

the field on second and nine from their own ate up Nagel that was Harris the fullback seeping out of the backfield hunters is long and accurate as he has been in previous games : skarzinski to the near side third and nine Tennessee men and the Tennessee cheerleaders Jackie Walker in on the play is ninth tackle with four assists so it is fourth down coming up open seven strong series of downs for Tennessee because Bobby majors is now back and we've got Penn State kicking from deep in their endzone earlier he returned upon a 45 yards for a touchdown an absolute beautiful thing with the help of his teammates blocking now it's Parsons back to punt he has a hundred and seventyone yards on kick returns and wisely Bobby calls for a fair catch at the Tennessee whether the Penn State 47 volunteers take over majors his average returned today forty two point eight and six points they played great field position football the best field position Penn State's had the ball on in exchanges than their own 29 yard line to potential receivers to the near side of the field from the 47 and 10 state Thompson and lover over to the side Phil rudder SquarePants stop a touchdown before let's take a look at rubber again quick slant fakeblock in there by Chauncey there's the daylight he runs right through the linebacker the halfback bounces off him and then he stumbles as he breaks into the

Pottsville Pennsylvania 15 carries 97 yards filling in for the injured Kirk Watson alltime Tennessee rusher and runner a sophomore he's showing his mettle at the 11 now it would be second down and one 752 to go third quarter upset in the making Tennessee 21 penn state 3 Rutter stop but he gets the first step toughest place in the feel the store he's got first down as you can see just barely inside the 10yard line Tennessee will meet Arkansas in their Liberty Bowl Monday night December 20th right here on ABC Royals Razorbacks are watching their opponent while the Texans the Longhorns are watching Penn State their opponent in the Cotton Bowl first and goal good defensive work by Penn State Tennessee using the fake in effectively as Penn State really closed let's take a look at gray the linebacker second down goal to go from the nine well I'll pull it intercepted in the end zone or was it s it was 6:45 to go in the third quarter here's hufnagle from the twenty first down great master Parsons Parsons the converted quarterback shows his power win gap Pennsylvania's fourth catch now from the 34 first down Penn State and huffnagle line skarzinski Tennessee defenders believing that they had knocked the ball loose of every covered the 611 to go in the third quarter they led at the end of the first quarter seven to nothing at halftime 21 to 3 huffnagle has thrown 15 times completing town for 103 yards now the split into the near side of the field second and 10 great throw now with the ball at the 47 of Tennessee first down right L Mitchell in Stillwater second and seven Penn State bitching about the Parsons at the last moment for a twoyard loss this defense has got to be among the quickest kristef that we've seen all year they're not big but they read extremely well and they certainly close on the ball but they've had tough opponents they've allowed only 97 points in ten games make it a hundred now with the three the Penn State has on a 27yard field goal only one team scoring more than one touchdown against them in Alabama Alabama undefeated now coming to the nearside goal fortyeight along with skarzinski 84 in the slot on third and nine hufnagle intended for Parsons 21 to 3 Tennessee leads 448 to go third quarter Mike Fox ready to snap the ball he has majors looking at the punt and it is a homer by Parsons through the end zone touch back coming up on ABC's Wide World of Sports at 5:00 Eastern and Pacific also on the show Oh incidentally his name is Andy Sedaris the world skiing championships from Spain as well on wide world today now from the twenty first down going on the play Steve Chauncey number 41 from Knoxville for the lead we've gotten if we don't let them make the breakaway play we've got that upset gotta see in the arms if you're watching in color second and eight from their own 20 to rudder getting out near the 25 that's well the singer from Nashville Chansey on a great effort may have gotten a first down that was that little bit of a pass fake as Maxwell started back just enough to raise the guards and the linebackers of Penn State letting him pick up the first down on the Left Joe Paterno winning 83% of his games as head coach at Penn State and on the right bill battle will be 30 years old on Wednesday 19 and 3 and Joe thinking that first down gave them two more minutes of the clock all right coming up the three minute five to the third quarter Tennessee 21 Penn State three five more yards by rudder the fullback he's nearing the 100yard mark in fact he is surpassed it by five the Tennessee line beginning to kick out very effectively that was Gil Fullmer Tom Johnson leading the way Johnson to Center Fullmer the left guard the near side of the field the other guard until Eman daughter from Cleveland Tennessee Walter of them Hiller the tackles Megan PI from their own 35 can see why in a Texas Longhorns and the Cotton Bowl third niches the call by Maxwell variant spectacular plays but awfully effective against the clock when you're leading 21 to 3 now the next snap by Tom Johnson do Maxwell will come from the 41 yard line of Tennessee this drag started at the 20 the sooner they're leading up on the state 10 the nothing in the first quarter of Jack Mildred on a quarterback keeper went 5 yards the Oklahoma score wing to the split end formation Tennessee Chansey couldn't get to it control tennessee getting six first downs here in the third quarter with a minute 36 to go dancing very very hard out here Thompson and love left Maxwell throwing deep Hudson spreading their formation Thompson to the near side brings it in ducat on the tackle around the 10 let's watch time center in the isolated camera this is one that Maxwell really up and fired here he comes down the field against Ellis looking for the ball and he is wide open against that three deep making the catch Tennessee on the 15 he drew that with all the confidence in the world hitting his man Joe Thompson the senior from Savannah Tennessee at the 13 yard line first and 10 Fowler goes to the right to the left Thompson and Chauncey Jerry's about the seven once again the Tramp opens up against the even set in the middle say Peck 60 in 20 mess Co in on the tackle at the 7 yard line a game of six second and three and can't seem shaken up on the play let's see if Salva comes in George Sylvie rather comes into the lineup there you see Chauncey and Maxwell very wisely Chris took a timeout not wanting to risk the 5yard penalty for delay the game at this point 15 seconds remaining in the third quarter each week throughout the fall watch ABC for college football with time out the score Tennessee 21 penn state 3 11th play of this Drive that began at the 20 rudder rudder getting near the five at the end of the third quarter here at Neyland Stadium in Knoxville Tennessee the score the volunteers 21 the Nittany Lions three barry sullivan guest stars on Marcus Welby MD Tuesday night on ABC the snap to

both four scores a 15 yard drive and that's what it's been the volunteers trying letter to the floor and it appears he is short of the first down with the ball being held by max well at the 11 21 yards on a severe angle cuts Pickers up the good 21 yard threepointer for the volunteers of Tennessee as they now lead 24 to 3 with 14 minutes and 17 seconds left in the game tomorrow on ABC college football 1971 we feature highlights this season's key games that's college football 1971 tomorrow on ABC at 12 noon 11:00 central time and the host bill Fleming tells me that it's a wonderful exciting highlights show and time beginning to run out on Penn State they're a great offensive football team they've got to be able to break something for a long long yardage here however to get back in the steady drives the clock is likely to run out on them before they can get the points on the board 22 cappelletti 23 Lydell mitchell 87 head O'Neal or beat let's kick high in the air it'll come down near the goal line and it's thickened by cappelletti out to the 10 the 15 for Penn State down at about the 19 yard line making the tackle Danny Jeffery the statistics at the end of the third quarter make it look like a very even football game with Penn State slightly in charge 261 total yards 242 we missing statistic the 223 yards that Tennessee has made on kicked run backs so their total yardage actually is 465 if you include those run backs which we found a decisive part of this game 1410 remaining in the ballgame John Hufnagel of McKee first down Lydell Mitchell Penn State is average 320 yards rushing per game in ten starts this year to go undefeated on that play they pick up three yards out to the 22 there is Mitchell shaken up on the play Franco Harris second at seven humping Gould brought down by number 82 Ken Lambert he's a four five the Sprinter he was a hurdle champion he came in there that time without anybody touching him he just moved right by everybody and it's down at the 14 a loss of eight yards third down and 15 Penn State has rushed the ball 40 times for 131 yards their only scoring a 27yard field goal by viddy l:o at 8:42 of the second floor frank O'Hara and on the artificial turf he slips and falls at the 18 yard line and now back deep is Bobby majors who's returned one kick for six points there's Mitchel number 23 Bobby Parsons of Penn State kicking and in the shadows on the artificial turf of fair catch call for my Bobby majors at the 45 a 37yard punt Tennessee will have the ball at its own 45 a timeout at Neyland Stadium in Knoxville the score Tennessee 24 and state 3 if you know how to use a Kodak Instamatic snapshot camera then you know how to use a Kodak Instamatic movie camera it just as easy drop in the film to load press a button to shoot this Kodak Instamatic movie camera cost less than $35 why not give someone you love the gift of movies is Christmas in movies as in snapshots kodak manages hard 12 minutes and 16 seconds remaining here at Neyland Stadium right by the banks of the Tennessee River after a rain sleet and snow yesterday at the 55 degree afternoon sun shining Tennessee leading 24 to 3 at the 45 their own first down volunteers carrying on the play bill rudder the leading ground gainer on the field is Bruce Fannin has been on the tackle along with gray oh and Mitchell had a bruise on his ankle but he is expected to play second and seven now let me see Maxwell into the plant the pullback rudder rudder spun back buys a pack and Ellis and one get out of bounds and kill the clock he does a little punishment to do it third down and six for Tennessee Neyland Stadium and the University of Tennessee campus tremendous school here in the south and so is Penn State in the mountains the Nittany Mountains State College Pennsylvania formation the far side 36 Sylvia over there that was chancy number 41 hobby majors back to punt inside the 20 at about the 15yard line up Nagel in at quarterback from the 14 okay Penn State with a first down their own 32 a marker goes down as Harris carries it is illegal motion five yards here's the play that Bobby majors was shaken up looking back is the receiver here you can see him turning major is really closing on him and that is some collision looking back here 63 229 pounds first and 15 from the 27 lon pass intended for number 40 wicked back covering was Denny Jeffries number 48 in the orange jersey as Tennessee leads 24 to 3 956 left in the game and all coaches would like to throw the ball when they want to instead of when they have to when Joe Paterno of Penn State is now reduced score wise 24 to 3 to a situation where he has got to throw it well earlier I mentioned Penn State's rushing average 320 yards and 10 games today 131 now with a second and 15 at their own 27 I'll go Kludd Simonton number 62 breaking through the thrill Hufnagel for a tremendous loss Simonton joined by Tom Bennett number 86 in the loss is back to the 17 yard line it'll be third and 25 to mobile and dresser defense had all the discussion always among football people if you pick size and weight or you take speed mobility and agility and you're not giving away too much there's just no doubt about what you ought to be doing and that's going with speed football's a game a reaction much more than a game of size and strength number 44 Bobby majors comes back into the lineup he's been a hero here today third and 25 from the 17 Penn State Rickon back the intended receiver 125 now for the Nittany Lions Bobby majors covering on the play with nine minutes and one second remaining in the ball game twenty four to three Tennessee leading they led at the end of the first quarter seven to nothing at halftime twenty one two three twenty four two three at the end of the third quarter and the relentless pressure that they have put on Penn State is beginning to take its toll Parsons ready to punt majors looking at it what a day he is having on kick return look at this boys he is to the 19 of Penn State was one of those low kicks and when I saw take off this I said deep trouble for Penn State over 200 yards on kick returns Bobby majors number 44 including a touchdown Franco Harris makes the stop for the Nittany Lions so just inside the 20 Maxwell a fourth stringer when we were here earlier in the season to do the Auburn Tennessee game is now replaced by Dennis Chadwick number 21 correction maxwell is still in there let's see that kick return again this is a team play watch major Z the cube root coverage was certainly not down there because the clique was so low but the Tennessee blockers do just a magnificent job we're gonna pick off those white shirts the majors of course with that great poise once he hits that Lane down the sidelines cuts back but once again Parsons believe this is making a great break tackle to save the touchdown second down and eight now from the 17 overthrown Joe Thompson number 90 there is Bobbie majors averaging 40 and a half yards on kick returns today and one touchdown it's an unbelievable statistic before the game the majors family saluted by the University of Tennessee they recalled the first family of volunteer football and of course included John Billy and Bobby of course their dad mr. Shirley majors coaches Suwannee College third down and eight Frank Aaron hold the senior from Northport New York comes from his defensive tackle position to throw old Maxwell for a loss the losses back to the 28 yard line now it'll be right on the 35 plus the 10 of the endzone 45 yards pick us up to the left of the goalposts Noga Harrison Mitchell behind him Mitchell Christian you were saying Penn State really have to go to work they will I can't think of a defensive team and football though that I would less likely be going against three touchdowns behind at this stage of the game because the poor deep for Tennessee are exceptionally proficient football players they cover that field just blanket it back there and it's almost impossible to make anything go all the way what a game the Liberty Bowl will be here on ABC the night of December 20th as Tennessee will go against powerful Arkansas second down and nine huffnagle trying to hit coal and he did gets him inbound seems intelligent fall and they'll severely just his Tennessee defense that is excellent against the path if you can see right here Peggle intercepted and another six points Tennessee Jackie Walker white allamerican Rutger had scourged one other touchdown this year on a return boy oh boy things go right second touchdown but but also because he was in perfect position and the pregame show we had some good shots of Walker doing precisely what he did there he's a little late moving over there and the quarterback doesn't see him and then you've got that burst of speed to move into the lane to pick it off no George no extra point attempt perfect timeout at Neyland Stadium in Knoxville with a score surprisingly Tennessee 31 Penn State 3 well the Tennessee defense has scored three touchdowns today helping the volunteers to a31 to three lead over unbeaten in trip Frank cannon fake 6 33 to go in the ballgame George hunt the kickoff to Penn State Mitchell cappelletti and the Millard beef this time hunt put it in the end zone it'll be a touchback and penn state will try to work the ball from the point let's see the Jackie Walker interception touchdown he's the linebacker and watch him work to the outside late here maybe coming from the left of your screen at skarzinski breaking down the field and there's Walker from the top of the screen and you can see him now as he's late moving out here but he's got that extra burst of speed he's right in the lane now moving from the inside out and he's got great speed he took it back all the way though from the 20 now hufnagle number 16 yes to senior Franco Harris rob3 on the tackle State Krishna's had the ball on 11 different exchanges in the best field position that they've gotten the ball in exchange as their own 29 yard line so addition to the great aggressiveness speed and mobility of the Tennessee defense they've played almost perfect field position football and their deepest penetration was to the Tennessee 10 from where they kicked a 27yard field goal at 8:42 of the second quarter second down and seven smegal nice catch five Bob Parsons number 86 bringing it out as you see in front of the Tennessee bench and near the 40 this pass has been open all day and it's one of the toughest passes football to cover you can watch Parsons here on the crossing pattern the swing is to the left of the screen he's going back against the flow and you're almost certain to be open when you move that way because there's no one can drop off in front of you then stay from the 38 first down by Bill Mitchell stopped by Mike Jones a sophomore from Kingsport Tennessee 5:16 left in the game Tennessee 31 Penn State three Harris has 64 yards today Mitchell 72 yards and with the ball at the 38 it'll be second down and 10 skaar Pinsky out of the lineup to the far side Cole 48 at the bottom your screen the eye in the backfield hands are tight Parsons number 86 Joe Paterno and complete the start Penske cars in ski gets across the 30 of Tennessee with the ball near the 28 of Tennessee first down for Penn State by Dale Mitchell Mitchell to the 24 Jamie rotella in on the tackle number 57 we've talked about the mobility of the Tennessee defense Chris and their speed but I don't think we've talked about how they strike a blow believe me they're in the hitting position they Unleashed when the ball carrier gets in there range up niggle has completed 17 of 26 211 yards sixtyfive percent of his passes here's the second space for John giving a Mitchell want to move to the outside offended at about the 18 by Nick Carmichael number 11 Sugar Bowl January 1st and you get that tough v Kristen analytically includable it is a tough trip Kristin Ted Franco Harris going on the fly and we know there's one coach watching with interest here veteran rip angle whom Joe Paterno was an assistant to for 16 years at Penn State rip has taught him well but today the team just is not playing up to the other 10 games this year but they're going against the great Tennessee team and three big breaks Chris Tucker and they play the interceptions however and one of those on a second at six Hut Nagel hope to hit Franco Harris Jackie Walker 52 got his hands on it talking to Ray metals now number 58 and joined by 48 Danny Jeffries Walker number 52 certainly lived up to all of his advanced notice here today he's an allamerican he's small for linebacker he's only 200 pounds 6 feet tall but he's cut about as much speed as anyone I've seen playing this position and he reads very well he slips through the blocks and then it's got speed enough to move in and make the tackle and hit the deliverable they didn't have to go far to repeat it because he still not smell third and six Lydell Mitchell a shoot top tackle and a sherwin by number 11 sophomore Nick Carmichael and that was typical of the Tennessee defense a tremendous rush by Lambert a great play by Hufnagel to get it off and then Carmichael making the tackle at majors coming over to help on it I don't think I've seen as much orange since the Texas Arkansas game but a couple of years ago 1514 as we've seen here today what's the crime sure they have only 11 defenders there but it seems like a lot more great defensive tradition started by general Nayland who perhaps gave more to defensive college football and any coach thank heavens you another is carried on his third buddy up single now on a fourth down completing us to light L Mitchell Mitchell gets the first Penn State touchdown on a 15yard touchdown pass from John help they go so it's 31 tonight with a pen of 31 to go in the ball game the Nittany Lions ready to go for two points going for two now calling signals coming around very fast Chuck heard number 25 against him making him 31 in women and seeing Mitchell day being hemmed in most of the time reminds us some great cruet on Thanksgiving Day against the tremendous Nebraska defense but no matter how great the running backs are Chris no running room they all look alike you get them stretched out however these superior skills begin to be readily apparent pence",

listed as 511 190 Alabama coaches told us this week because of the heat in Alabama he was down to 170 tackle and that might account for why they have gone at roll the last couple play they want to test him they have some big men blocking on him Keith wasn't 2:38 done left to 37 they bounce back into the air for the first time it has committed by think about first down the gym I don't think there's any doubt that we're gonna have scoring in this game you look at the respective offices Nebraska at this morning to blow the ball averaging a little 38 points per game for 11:22 today are just in the first quarter good formation they usually pass them there and do storm safety number 40 as well as Higginbotham number 49 what about if a little madness Johnny Rodgers is I say little because he's just 510 one leading top receiver for the Cornhuskers also averaging on the ground and any better than seven yards per carry every time he has second down ten Raja's the shot just off the left offensive tackles Jeff Kinney hipfire yeah to get out of his chocolate inside the 30yard line well in the Sugar Bowl today Oklahoma defeated by Nebraska the great game defeated Auburn 4222 they come to both Penn State 25th of six in the game we hope you saw here on NBC the Rose Bowl Stanford up South Michigan of applause no score and this one gets for themselves one cup right baggy baggy for kidding Oh get by Higginbotham and Jeff lousy we might point out that way as the basket is basically a fiveman line again I'm using the basket has had the ball for seven plays Alabama had it for three and had to kick it away okay just doing you leave I spin out Jeff Jenni driving in there that's strong as apply the Alabama defensive team winding ours coming up from his safety position now we're back to live action goes down from the play picked out this guy bikini going outside you need to hold up with it generate four times for 21 yards looks like we'd be wait coming up with a safety spot making that first attempt at the tackle which slowed the runner down and they bring his teammates to come in to make that tackle reaction by this Alabama defensive unit okay the good powerful blocking by the corner is that fun the party second down and 12 by day look like a big boy number 36 the sophomore linebacker Chuck's quickly I don't think Jay had any place to go with that though the identify lawyer you can do at that point they're trying to pick up as much Regained as much damn at the moment it looked like that left side was wide open boss Deanna's who's comin as his foot in and comes out why the way Plato hid them behind get them to putting our these are going to call it back Jim they thought him down just before he got rid of that bar arriving shaggy but they are bringing it back to the point there's a quick replay look at Robin Park shots on this play as he comes in he's the one that will be right on shaggy right at this point as the knee hit the ground the official right honors and that was what kill look like walk down and putty and they are going for Maggie more things bloggers together an action will continue here at the I'm for with the score and the both Kentucky and Alabama nothing which I wrote this is Jim Simpson back of the iron bull Alabama with the ball at the 31st have done the best to have the ball for 12 plays five minutes and fifteen seconds and could not score Michela of the first man through picks up a couple of yards the Bob Theriot who intercepted a pass to stave off LSU in the last quarter of last two years lights on for game to help win the national championship get on the tackle along with Jim plant the farm sideline vitamin look if you want Indian as we saw against the Alabama wishbone the Nebraska defensive ends will take away the pitch they will just fly to the outside to prevent the pitch from being successful on welcome information and that's got a new so they shall get for free our red rubber number 79 Jacobson 75 the two old American bases top of another allamerican Johnny Musso there's a good shot of John Hannah and Larry Jacobson going at each other too big allamerican 7375 Jacobson in Alaska and on that play Hannah turning Jacobson outside third down and two looking for facedown haven't had one yet there's the picture hi baby and you'll see in the backfield to take to one side that will throw the keys off defensively they hope and apparently it did when the man finally came in Johnny Atkins the defensive end the fourth quarter fact Rousseau was open for the fifth job 81 Willie Harper coming from another independent position to make the tackle six minutes to go first quarter device back in the risk are not as peculiar the hold on will be inside the 40 down at the 37 yard line left defensive and made the sixth grade 221 not a great game and last very full time for 31yard nearly eight yards apart second down seven we once again to the show dia and we have a flag down for the first time Bob Kerrey all getting up after the stop and Nebraska talking with the officials led by referee Pete Williams and Jim Anderson one a freeman on the bus is far from Green Bay Wisconsin he and what about Gary tag e on the cocaptains not fish off five yards first penalty takes it back to the 42 while they go locally john justin is now effeminate defensive lightcycle from the breast remember mighty Samson is out at Paul Bear Bryant on this side of the field without that famous little prize at this point Jim Alabama has yet to throw a pass all over Terry David he doesn't go often I would guess you would say 66 passes completed 42 of them known 20 those goals he's quite accurate but they saw us come in playing the tight end position number 27 nearest field second down cloud but surely the fallback gets inside the book John definitely just came in was in on the tiger again Jim branch the strong side linebacker number 51 doc continues to run for 45 to go in the first quarter no score over the bus with 39 it is third down and nine for Alabama rich Clover can intimidate any sub and look at a miscue I'm sure Terry Davis Bush had not prepared very alertly getting back on the ball way gathers come in as Davis comes up Gant kicks off but also handles the punks 41 point 9 yard average Johnny Roger goes deep and it might be to allow larger the remaining Africa the Cornhuskers of Nebraska had the ball up your own 42 first down and 10 Cox comes broad right to the bottom of his dream Raja's emotion giddy with the football and picks up about five and goes into Alabama territory give him six on the play at a second down and hold my example the number 46 has come into the place bill holes that pulled up Gant talking to one of the coaches like an anvil again Kenny to the yarder so look like Chuck sniffing number 36 the sophomore made the stop Chuck is listed in the bush or Afghan from Chattanooga but his folks walked through the noise from East Ridge Tennessee notice the vodka quite often will spend regular time over that ball quite often they are simply calling automatics at the line of scrimmage maybe that fight Raja's American and appearing to a man he's got the great timing on those two largest thumbs up and as he cuts up right behind the block of jury list 85 lifts putting that block on Steve Higginbotham number 49 the cornerback would come up to force the play bagging looking deep down this outlines other cause trying to keep from interfering the xvid you'll see them trying to pull up right about this point that's where a Jocelyn Williams knowing it he doesn't make contact trying to pull back away from me yep penny car blocking of at the backdrop and good line let's enter wooden and affix a guard right up the middle yep getting a I get a hold I'm going to try to add the extra point that the are eight yards and forth less blood action will continue here and fold this for Nebraska six Bob Devaney head coach of the busted resident Holland Michigan particle very proud of an affair 58 seconds s\u00e4nger to kickoff Williams and McKinney are deep so that is William took the football and gets up to the 25yard line for the third time and this is the thought game of this season for the Crimson Kalevala donor they are behind a high pass from Center on the front as we see the penalty stepped out there for a personal foul and then of course the in offense called against William I've got a first and goal to go of the two Canaan who scored four touchdowns in the Oklahoma game landed in I was pushed down from the 39 and there's the personal foul signal one of the in the basket tackles arriving a little too late on the scene and their people defend Wailord to the left daily to the local running out for the bottle babies running up and you can see brother on top of him walk came up there's big rich 1279 the junior 6 1 2 34 fighting his way through his assignment to take that 4 to 5 as it comes back in you see up the top of your screen 57 Atkins who turned a fish man right ahead no effect thirtyfive Theriot 45 getting up after the packet one minute to go in the quarter it is six to nothing matreshka the ball up to 44 yard line third down and five the Alabama theme during the little counter stuff in the backfield findability in the last year different cookies are I know they've been forever walking away from bill Jensen and ran right back in the global political Davis first times he's tried there 79 clever he's the first one that makes the fourth and 55 Janssen and again in the do the kicking remember the last time it was a bad snap this one is perfect Jolly Rogers what I'm grateful the great locked up on the right side the gates concentrating punt returners kickoff returner although God talked to us about kicking away from Johnny Rotten if you have any kind of field position at all the kicking game is what's an individual Alaska means 12 nothing time is out in the first quarter it's from this wrong level camera you'll see some great moves by Paris he moves in and out taking out these defensive men who are coming down under the kick and then he starts picking up some key blocks downfield like the top of the screen another one by theirs with excellent speed waiting fast receivers leading kick returner against Oklahoma in the third three during 1971 and he starts out 1972 by returning before having missed the first next approach they were going for two this finger will pick I'm the Kenny 26 Williams again and and look like either in Parkton obey them all about the 27yard my password better a punt return and now a fumble on a kickoff and Alabama is Johnny lodges trying to get outside and is knocked out and maybe pulled off 14 to nothing Alabama in the first quarter gained 34 yards only attempted one press then as we said the kicking game but has the best rate in fun rhaggy in a can't hold on to it change that that is listed quite in number 85 not 35 and it will be third down and 12 an Alabama trying to muster its defensive forces well then they can get back in this ball game boss the ambition is coming for the best for seven for 36 yards the middle and olive garden didn't help Gary dick conduct in the lineup another look at daddy going back Dixon was at the slots position just go right over the middle they picked it again victim vomit of five and impounded by a guy with a brain Dixon Jr from Oxnard California Alabama's defense has averaged seven point six points per ballgame given up thus far they've given a 14 and the basket is knocking at the door again get the coal and look it up play by robin park out all Southeastern Conference second team allamerican from Orlando Florida and they're from a different level parked out coming out enough to make the tackle on victim marked out 6:3 201 a senior allamerican language 39 for the basket Peggy looking thank you with some good faking in the back feeling good blocking right there by Jerry Dixon 22 we've been making those lines as you saw us figure out of bounds right on the one I was watching a Nebraska man thought it was just done time he stepped out of about the one as you can see in the replay Oh down and the body are then they vomited with that guy very Peggy something creative to this time right his wife guard keyboard big groupers collect are piling underneath their crying with Sanger 64 64 during the regular season as another flight I can we'll continue here at the Iron Bowl with the squirrel now early in the second quarter Nebraska Roger Jim Simpson the car wash anger will kick off again to McKinney and William mckinney this guy up to the 30yard line here's their best pickup man laughter don't MBC we'll be right back here in this Iron Bowl professional football game the American Football Conference championship game Baltimore down here again the Dolphins of Miami at 8:30 Eastern Time and Qatar here on NBC dolphin 30 Alabama down 21 11 12 and a half minutes to go in the half David and little hopper drag him down for five I don't have to believe that in preparation for the big game both clubs made some minor adjustments some very minor adjustments I get to my fellow to their regular attack they put in counter place to try and counter against defensive key it must be confusing they must have blown a couple plays already for that very reason and Shelia and Tara's in on the stop along with Jim branch Alabama before that play had a medal 29 yards Nebraska has Nike and the Buster has 24 plays Alabama 16 Jim Simmons was checked in as a tight end for the Crimson God number 85 on the sidelines therefore they're brought on David Bailey the lady Davis trying to get something going gonna do and Alabama the Buddha kicking again very chef kicked off the side of his foot it's an Alabama bounce door and now 35yard when is down on the 30yard line Bosco will take over western canon actually will continue hinky arms roll the score in the second quarter in the basket 21 Vaska six first downs Alabama to Cornhuskers ball question I'm 32 down count second man 311 lost them during 1971 Houston was the top team to score against them 20 points the bruster already has 21 we order that offensive line supplemented with a blocking of their backs pillows on that last play and the metric key block on the line dr. firing in there any gets the call again and again a big hole Mitchell Jonathan in Paterson number 90 moved in as right defensive tackle for Alabama replacing Jim beer how other get there any scare the ball nine times for 34 yards there's Rogers took me out of that backfield building right across the middle wide open a great catch and as he tried to put it away the tackle hit by Steve Williams knocking that ball loose there some stevewade the Alabama juniors picking it up Robinson trying to pick him up the ball is now back through the oneyard line looks like Steve Williams is down and of course after the recovery by Wade later the clipping penalty has taken them all back to the oneyard line action will continue here at the irons ball to score the basket 21 Alabama nothing in collegiate raise you cannot pick up a fumble once it hits the ground and run it so where he hit it picked it up his word goes who yep now ruling there as Williams walked off revealed defendant hits the ground of course until a wave picked it up and played with his jab there had it gone one more yard he picked it up at the end zone it would have come out to the punty fortyfour Steve Michelle you getting up his brother Jacobson also right there now let's go quickly to develop the monastery there trouble of bills microphone is checking for Jean Williams when you set on the pump and the 70yard 78 yard return yardage as oscar has Bernie forced Alabama in the many mistakes the Cornhuskers are rolling there is Dixon bowing to the PR bar 39 minutes and five seconds of playing climate well you talk about a balanced team we've seen the Nebraska defensive unit in action we're watching their offensive unit in action and we've seen the effect of their kicking and kick return team I mean bad bowl right there the whole 63 prior to and again 44 billows leading in through there with a good block number 36 Chuck supremely a linebacker for Alabama boy the bastards out in front of this battle than imagine Jevon jet by 2018 now come to suppose a pair of MBC on television in February for the 11th or one beer well NBC and here them.he jumper accent1 to other olympic gutters and pretty Peggy Fleming who brought home America's only gold medal in 1968 negative television date NBC's exclusive Olympics coverage from Zipporah Japan February 1st to the 15th 28 to nothing Paul Bear Bryant 1 210 ball games but down 28 to nothing here at Sanger jigsaw your pick and offensive back in there as Williams was out after the injury and Bamberger Nathan stop number 46 when the flag is down for what reason we just can only assume it's perhaps a clipping penalty they usually occur on such place Lag is down at the 36 yard line holding that there's like a holy seconds holding is what is charged against Alabama I'm talking things over with safety man but they will push and they're marching off the outage back inside the 20 to the 19 now the Crimson Tide Alabama's helping offer 20 players Nebraska 429 ends the roll off that gives you cross the 20yard line for the 23 Jim went with the stop number 51 gain afford a second down and six eight fifteen to go in the second quarter that's one of the few times as far that Alabama has picked up substantial yardage up the middle the story thus far Johnson Weber Jacobson the middle of that Nebraska one map emotion out to the road Johnny Musso and another life richkrappa Virginia riding off the block Nick rattle reaction welcome to DC judged on love nominator rich clever offensive lineman of the year they've gone seven days ago they're definitely right great birthday raise the playability Ronny Rogers is James our kick coming Rodgers back inside the 30 and Daisy gets out to the 35 yard line on top of him was number 70 John Copeland when action will continue here in the iron golem irony with the score Nebraska 28 and Alabama nothing yes I can tell you here you I'm ready okay okay well what happened I had a release to go find out what the heck happened I couldn't find a stage manager either I could have given you a real quick pop okay yeah okay our tiles got a question done if you can get that drum level if you can get that ground level camera shooting some reaction shots of a bellboy super shots when something goes wrong with me story in the paper Jim Simpson with car or I'm gonna show you down there for report on Steve Williams and not gonna leave me could possibly have a slight those with but he should see that actually but he's still seeing cobwebs right now back up to you alright push down the Buster after 36 this is a is the feedback saying his powerful Tom moves in Donald on up there at the 42 yard line Lena consumed us Tia remember 20 orders of reshape they made the stuff a 19yard kettle now Chuck chicken coming back in as a middle linebacker got a rocker Pepper's John Mitchell who turned him in but it was Robin Park outs who made the stop and they're appalled bear blood another look very quickly number ninety Robin Park South coming all the way from the other side to make the tackle in a foreigner second down in ship very good inside there versus city coming back on the inside it just opened up beautifully they let the reaction of his new be the lights make the defense to get off to that side now going back underneath from the ten yard line Sagi still got the football and down near the thick McKinney and McMakin number 18 and on the tackle Robin Park now again eleven first downs Alabama to another your defense and offense white guys Jenny on River loggers on the reserve only picked out the option when he caught big wad right Guinea again and he's not gonna get him up there now that is number 18 McMakin the strong side safety that made this up Oh God when after that great game against the basket said it's the most complete football team he has ever seen and I'm sure the cola beer bong when Garson is come in number 13 arms Guinea getting up and get drowsy along with Chuck Strickland they made this guy was at the free number 85 Jerry list of Nebraska he started off and was outside illegal procedures called and so instead of four walk down the me we're minutes 43 seconds to go in the head that other bring the kicking came in and I believe the first record list be started early this whole part out song now a singer five of nine field goals prevails against Iowa State with chagi to hold at the 50 level if off to the side and Alabama has held first and ten for the Crimson Tide what do they do to advance against that Nebraska defense senior ballgame lob love NBC will be there at two o'clock Eastern Time back Saturday afternoon the best of the graduating seniors but again my question Kyle what's the devil devil do they have apparently not been able to solve a running up the middle it's been just too much of those three big men up front dancing whether Jacobson email famous to put the ball in the air barely there's the left calf David Bailly a finger ring up pattern I think is outside waiting on Dave Mason 25 interesting story there Kyle as a sophomore caught 56 passes as a junior 55 passes this year caught on the block while only 21 may have not been Troy down to 25 and up the middle you're jealous BEC when chatting on the engine let's go over there again you can see Harper the defensive right in going out with the pitch off man making sure that they weren't able to get the wide play going requiring him to either have to handle the ball back up inside himself less than three minutes now and this 28 nothing ballgame second down and seven Gant goes out wide to the top of the screen this is Johnny Mitchell breaking it it is fifth up by hopper that's a push down for Alabama the ball moves out to the 47 yard line know so again a little counter play just a little wrinkle they put into the offensive attack trying to take advantage of a normal Nebraska defensive reaction Davis Gill at the ball has time to say like their weapon was number 18 Jim Anderson they say about Anderson he has only made two mistakes mellow grave beat him on a 569 while playing with Missouri and last year Coffey of LSU caught a touchdown pass on it other than that this is his windup this a senior at Nebraska nobody else has beaten cocaptain Jim Anderson second down intent not a new so scared of all seven times this show at the ball again and picked up again by Bob Theriot as he gets to the 50yard line it'll be third down and about seven with two minutes to go where is that awesome of a sturdy thing and again many different rhythm for the Alabama offensive unit looking at Davis's statistics 66 five days an 11game season not too many now Carrie Davis says he would like a timeout Davis will walk over and talk things over with Paul Bear Bryant Alabama undefeated through 11 games of 1971 Nebraska working on a 31 game streak without a loss one time 22 without a loss or time let us see what villainess nice to say bill again you know Jim I think they generate the amount of sidelines they're probably putting in all sorts of little adjustments there and the communications problem is a big one particularly when you're serving 28 to nothing everyone has a suggestion players including myself and fortunately he woke again here ours but he's examining the communications problems for everyone shopping suggestions and instructions to him complicated or a little different formation well if you just got home amended wires at 28 to nothing when to the first touchdown Johnny Rodgers returned the pump 78 yards for a touchdown there was a fumble on the kickoff to set up a touchdown and then another fumble right there within with Joe Blaha number 27 and right with Davis was woody Hoffman half as we said was the defensive lineman last year's arm full game and against Oklahoma was his job and Calvin talking about it just watched the pitch man and he made one tackle and one assist because his job was simply to watch Greg Troy Rogers goes deep again on fourth down and seven with a minute and a half to go and that's game he will handle honey he's climbed for the out of bounds but it didn't the pain water 25 28 yard line the tackle was made there by Jim pop 54 that's a football again from the 28th Jerry Peggy and there goes Steve Williams shaken up on number 46 Terry Wow number 57 defensive tackle number 63 made the special the appointed hour your wild size 511 he's listed as 190 pounds we have been told by people I guess it should know people who work with him but he is probably closer to 180 done a tremendous job at Jim Patterson has now come in flags go down diction carries the ball out to the 30yard line Tom Tillis holding on to the ankles but the penalties coming up against the Cornhuskers of Nebraska and that's robbing Park House talking with the referee Pete Williams now there's Terry Ronald legal motion by Nebraska with used by Annabella head down and ten and our parents coming back Strela the dressing room also along with witness on the engine let's leave that Patterson and Baron it's like a loose ball for a moment it is picked up by Nebraska addiction was the runner that's the Botox of the 35yard line and now Alabama calls timeout with 24 seconds left and fourth down they'd like to get the ball one more time all right villainous are you there hello yes we are down here we had one injury the Steve Williams of course he is back in the ball game the wide receiver a moment ago Wayne wheeler number 82 was shaken up had a shoulder bruise but he seems to be all right here on the Alabama side of the bench on the field there Jim and Kyle the players so they're not out of it Jeff there's a lot of spirits still down here and that's the way it looks from here let's go back upstairs to you all right bill as you are talking you are looking at the face of Paul there by talking with the players as Jeff users come in for the first time of day hi pastor back to the 15 and gets out to the 30yard line he was offended by Gary Dixon number 22 and now with 14 seconds left in the half a 48yard hunt by humans is been averaging 36 hours no Tyriq and I'm looking for a close rough tough ballgame decided and the closing moments and maybe maybe it yet will be but this host after all belongs to Ma brusca Alabama has made mistakes the basket has been strong offensively and defensively on me keep asking Davis six seconds to go in the half Davis the winner who flipped they're gonna talk all is on the 47 yard line and perhaps time for one more play Sawyer is in and comes out wide life only to the left wheelers then they've got him three wide receiver David working fire path we live apart again the most oldest card and his family's inside the 40th no more not be a medical problem there is magic in the air as our flowers from the life to join with everyone in Lansing to an upbeat version of well already unusual occasion now we all know that's been pretty charming Feeny community there has always be improved which to bring a happy ending but in our story the cleaning role of the kid well our magical story of classical music comes to an end with everyone happy ever after and we conclude as we say goodbye to 1971 by wishing you and yours happiness ever after especially in 1972 good night and God bless you all Thank You Anita Bryant thank you any salad the yards both committee for another wonderful apps on the doors to rust at 28 Alabama nothing as we get ready for the second half kickoff of the 1972 our whole game so again from the arms for Jim Simpson the pyro 28 to nothing a lot of breaks but for Kyle better than six yards per ambassador less than two yards for tri for Alabama well offensively in the blaster is really just blowing them off the field they are overpowering them in the line offensively defensively Alabama has yet to solve the problem of going up the middle they they are shutting off the outside they're not giving them the outside at all and thus far they've held them completely in check in the middle Alabama has to figure out how to run up the middle or get their passing game going which we saw Terry going to right toward the end of the first half so I expect to see him put the ball in the air again here in the second half if he's still having trouble running up the middle and the four touchdowns of course have been on a high pass from Center 77 yard kickoff return by Johnny Rodgers a fumble on a kickoff and a fumble on the running Bob Devaney and as the rescue squad across the way they won the national championship in this very game one year ago tonight defeating LSU and a fourthquarter comeback 17 to throw since that time they've gone on to win 12 other games and here are those first half statistics Kyle and interestingly enough statistics I don't believe appears or the number of times each team has handled the ball Alabama has handled of all 53 plays Nebraska only 36 fell over Nebraska's rolled up a total of 225 yards total offense against 96 that's pretty much the story as we get the second half kickoff on the way gasps sense Rodgers into the end zone and out of the end zone and the basta will take over first and ten on their own 20 total repeat again there's a hot pass and sent on again attempted hon when in the first quarter he was tackled their new gone in with the aid of an interference claim kenny scoring the first touchdown they kicked the ball away to rogers he scored 77 yards for a score then they kicked off the basket at Alabama they fumbled on the kickoff take pitch Jeff Kinney then he gets off to the 23 the way about unit number 28 that's 26 twentyeight because that of Steve Williams cannot play Stadium in Verdana Kenny 26 playing as his replacement second down and seven gimme again the 76 yards before that play and picks up about three more off to the 26 yard line and it's third down and hold any escort one of the touchdown incredible the number of touchdowns in the Resta offensive store 51 before tonight M altogether they're down Maggie in building fires and it is incomplete genoveffa Jeff Kinney and Robin Pacquiao was all over Gary taking an allamerican Robin Park job moving in the wind driving holes right back continues to come Anala Jeff here's we'll kick the ball away McKinney goes deep Alabama will get a chance as McKinney is there standing back on his 36 yard line they lift the ball and plant ought to get on the scoreboard McKinney has to call for the fair catch and has it at the 43 yard line where it is first and ten for Alabama a 30 yard punt after Hugh's father just snap from center in the corner the ends are on the Alabama crowd is up and asking the Crimson Tide to do something they average less than two yards per carry in the first time David that was really close that pick up a wait until the very last minute like the moment it looked like he had waited just a little too long got it off in time very quickly another look at it is Davis brings the ball toward you and there is a voting in Willie Harper number 81 finally came in on a pitch out we asked an interesting matchup Hannah in the lines around 11:00 all American going against Jacobson and drummer both allamerican they show their number 22 and allamerican carrying the football hopper goes up that inner light defensibility water background making the truck look at it number 45 five carry over linebacker Davis of course can run when they shut off the outside 50 yards before Davis again going to throw down an encore Billy across the way over his head at the 15yard line Joe Blow hark back to the pen it's second down ten twelve twenty seventh ago third quarter and the Resta leads it by four touchdowns and Alabama trying to get on the ball not amused oil so carries on the average of 19 of 20 times pavarga and so it is not unusual for him to repair it only 8 the first attribute top of his ring Davis if the dye inside the 20yard line we're getting up at the right in man David Oh down in the show time again 50yard gun is very cold f John duck Illuminati who made the tackle 55 yards by firing away faithful players Alabama's put together the deepest have gone in of Alaska territory Cuauhtemoc drawdown and Davis is going to get a yard or two number 57 Jonathan's left consensus ever made the stock Davis two yards at second down eight we're trying to figure out that he carries Alabama may have made at halftime where the flight they might have done we do see Hannah not playing out of the tackle position we'll put him directly off that Mary Jacobson we allamerica tackle on the block in the pastures plenty under cold and went up and got it though we come out to the 20yard line actually continuing here the unfold of course Hill laughter 28 Bob Devaney head coach in the busting Carl summer in charge of the offensive lawn on the phones to his right the last death of all folks in general then player is the up man in the our to pay back the rogers emotion lagging looking the floor Crimson Tide this fight blow hearts interception Kyle seemed to be a little bit more charged up along the sidelines well it's a for their sake it was a shame that he didn't hit him because it was wide open Davis under throwing this match and it was they're usually quite accurate during an extremely high percentage of 1863 we've only got one more first down in Alabama damn car girl so the 3/7 that is service on top of it and down below Jeff Halsey another third down play third down and three well this is a game everybody thought would be closed and it may yet be as we said but they thought the brakes was decided the most far a Buster has forced Alabama in the numerous plate Jerry chagi goes to the sidelines an opponent of Oscar has called turnout on on this fourth down the weather pared down play and free to go taggi wants to talk it over well show me coffee next Arace bought the van t hoff enjoy and are Lamanna that NBC comes right back here we have a short turnaround we'll be back at 4:30 tomorrow afternoon for Baltimore and lanolin of course remember later on in this month of January the American Football Conference National Football Conference Pro Bowl game that will be on Sunday the 23rd of January at forefront Eastern Time there is shaggy this team has not lost in the last 31 games trying to hold on to the national championship they won here a year ago Alabama coming off the cup of six and five seasons Johnny mucho said at the outset of our show he wants to be a part of a team that brings national honey second ship back to customers now a tagalong will not agree they are Dave and Rogers does not get to the 30yard line that if he hits a hot on the bus before the second series of downs in this half has been held in will have to punt the ball away service made the stop I'll try they'll get a turns on the football one more time right Alabama hasn't made any discernable changes in their defense of the line but they're just playing a little better than they did that first math as well as they know how used to kick the body McKinney and another good kick McKinney chasing it down at the 30 has it at the 29 the way of our Jeff penny it's the world after the 45yard on it we first have done for the Crimson Tide actually will continue here at the Iron Bowl with Lola lamenting is a desert have Don Brash 2:28 I got a little station ID but I'll say something before my niggas all right it will pour water there we pause briefly for station identification this is the NBC television network robbing Park cows along the sidelines apparently has read his leg that would be quite a blow to Alabama he's got a sue tonight first and 10 from the 45 fish man through number 44 Steve the sugar has it from the 45 out near the 49 Bob Theriot who has made a fumble of tackles tonight from his weak side linebacker spot a matter of fact he left the Cornhuskers all year long 96 total tackles and again we mentioned the Alabama defensive unit made no discernable changes as we watch a penalty game marked off I feel emotional Eagle motion they offensive unit for a good team that make any major changes at halftime well be so swiped you really couldn't notice them unless you studied films they're just very maybe hitting a hole a foot or two wider maybe they a little bit of blocking but nothing very major few money back for motion last on causing the five yards and here's the quarterback gonna draw again by Davis face down and pull and this is the play it worked successfully before and very alertly good reaction going to the outside when he saw stereo moving in a stereo chasing him good block downfield by Bubba Sawyer number 27 now back to live action Johnny Musso always seems to get a yard or two even when it looks like he's going to get none so as an academic allamerican as well as an allamerican Robin parked out putting his shoe back on 8:40 to go third quarter Nebraska 28 Alabama nothing in his second down and seven after the basket twentynine Alabama right where you left they'll pay for the shout in the pitch black makes all gets inside the 25yard line Jim Brian and as wide as those defensive ends are going to the outside to prevent that pitch up they ran the pit job inside of acting that time he finally caught up with mojo third out of the twenty nine and two yards to go they were still either football all right from the sideline viewpoint another located again Liliha was going way to the outside the pitch God is not there he's standing out there with the pitcher man David shutting it up here from Bill Fitch number twenty four seventy eight thousand one hundred fifty one looking on as Alabama was put together another drive here in the bird woman Navis answer machete who picks up some tough yardage PM Musab popper getting up mighty there's Pat Boyle number 40 Davis they're certainly not adverse to he he had his man wide open behind a biggest block he was coming on the play allamerican Larry Jacobson alone the football gets away from one man and gets inside the five yard knockdown it looked like by push again number 24 I'm Jerry Davis picked the tackle there to get inside the by Bobby Johnson very important 6:52 go all their God hoping for the miracle that the pension time came and we'll come back we're down from the brain nope not much there lover in the middle number 79 making that block my playground riding off getting into the runner and now as the Nebraska defense deploys it is fourth down and goal to go from the free for Alabama and I'm sure Davis knowing that the outside is completely shut off they're not going to let himself at this we know he's gonna have to go inside getting a good blocks of Musso to as house became back into meet the quarterback I'm sure out of Alabama sticking or claw heart cannot intercept that no defense Alabama fooled twice but now has got one they're going to do baby pick back trying to get into the end zone Mason the monster man drove it back and so action will continue here at the arms for with the score on the basket twenty eight okay with Carlos mr. Jim Simpson back to the Orange Bowl yes to kickoff you wonder what is going to kick it deep 49 seconds worth to go he kicks it deep underground escape he goes down to the horrible for the rasca cinnamon and cumin come out for the 21st exam they must even as they have in the second half both work the government's they had in the bus because web days are they cooked away from one man down Higginbotham was rehearsing three out to the 23 it is second down and seven five and a half minutes to go third quarter man almost got caught getting which might have they jump into a fiveman line put him and over five men line was made by a concern number 21 and Searle is 42 and the basket begins to move the football again by running 505 to go third quarter first down at the 39 of the brusca lostie Anderson has come in number 89 to the bottom of the screen as a wide receiver for the corner I'm dipping his feet then like he goes back has a lot of $5 on the other paw nagi of the foreigner the blaster apron turtle offend the thought in the top 15 as a rushing team has a passing team overall they look at what fine receiver like Johnny Rodgers has to go through getting job we get hit again the safety man who knocked it down we're back to live action take him down please second man cool Kenny close to the first girl it will be further they honored the championship flows into Tuscaloosa and the caterer Alabama ruts together the mother to sit him down here and you know what no tickets to be had when I got in so they're here in Miami but watching Orange Kenny being one out of Wayne Atkins with number 21 down the mall just over the 50 yard line and Alabama karakuri what 3:18 in the third quarter the last of 48 alabama 6 of a battle to the national championship basketball goes to that season wins tonight I do Higginbotham look at Anderson again a sixfoot one 176 pounds sophomore good move there be thinking about them coming over to try and make what a Cox is now replaced and as he comes off to the right William 31 yard on Higginbotham from the 31 bastard normally throws off this bread baggy backpack a looking deep out of the end zone cannot hold on to the ball Johnny Rodgers had his man beaten Shaggy put it on the money Rogers in full flood in the end zone when the ball got away from me Rustom used to vault inside Chris Paul Bear Bryant talking to Larry Davis's quarterback what he must do across the way to Bernie soldiers rustle around again by Higginbotham was in very parody in the last series of downs by the best wrote an excellent blog by Keith Wortman on Robin Park cows this year to the left of your screen right up at the top of the screen what was just turning parked out to the outside and 49 Higginbotham playing off the blocker to make the tackle always in a 215 Higginbotham is 6:1 166 car they're gone until and there is Chinni trying to get to the first down and it looks as though he's got it very close down there the 20yard line and they're going Anoka Bob Devaney funny thing they were talking about it the other day all they knock alleged adonys the bestest teams of one he has never yet been voted coach of the year first down the basket like his 211 tonight that he trails 28 to 6 my money out in the third book the wife will have good ball control this is the 11th player in this case could be there 12 Williams making the stuff I believe us Jolly Rogers Ernie is a little slow and getting up another look at this is Johnny Rogers coming out of the backfield from the slot back position and right on target pass hit there by blaze Elvis McKinney Rogers has a 77yard my prepared and they want us and John along the time I'm bill ESP ice pack on let's go back upstairs 78,000 151 and the game well there haven't been a few teams on dated and the major though they'd like this was back in 1956 with Oklahoma took mill an amazing eye from too often in collegiate history left Bowl teams undefeated halfpence in the history of the game it only happened about eight times there is Jacobson and there goes Johnny Bob Devaney has a personal little situation he'd like directed he's met Paul darabond twice before in bowl game the Orange Bowl of 1966 Alabama one of 29 to 28 novice courses the score indicates and then in 1967 over in the Sugar Bowl Russ was beaten by Alabama and Palmer Vaughn 34 to 7 while the banning has his team up 28 to 6 chef Hughes has come in to replace the injured workers and toriel gets up from the bottom of that pile one minute to go on the third quarter Kenny unofficially as charitable 20 times now if a 100 know Nixon has now come in replaced that is fiction there and he just does get back to the line of scrimmage and again you can see 57 Terry wild down at the bottom of the park he is the one that counted I've been talking about 511 190 but we were told that he was 177 at the beginning of this week has come in number 39 replacing dues in the place was there to give you an example of what that play differential means those linemen up front for Nebraska 221 down from the for tacky pulled and then therefore when he and with him was Higginbotham when I was fourth down 28 to 6 the scroll all of the bosses going in the first half and which singer has come in but he has picked his own the 1170 a 31yard field goal attempt with Frankie to hold our field goal for RIT sendin a Nebraskan Ali's Alabama by 25 points that's the end of the third quarter in this 1972 one goal game with the score on Nebraska 31 Alabama I'm Tom gay with another name but I'm concerned about the youth of America and rightly so because this is how I got my start this is many American athletes on the playground playing games today I'm involved with a most sophisticated and glamorous games college football although I'm afraid the youth of America are playing a different game a game that involves the use of drugs my football requires a great deal of mellow and physical discipline you don't allow yourself a fair chance to obtain these discipline the youth of America has a great deal to offer and a great deal to contribute to give yourself a fair chance to compete in the game of life stay away from drugs the officiating announcement was made on behalf of the National Collegiate Athletic Association Jim Simpson with Tyrone as we began the fourth quarter in the Orange Bowl ready 1 2 6 the busting magnetic McKenney Williams who was injured before takes the ball at the fall and down he goes another emphatically hit down by the number 46 Maureen damn poker in the Sugar Bowl today Oklahoma defeated by the vastra on its way to the arms ball forward over Auburn 42:22 Jack Miller another great day with 149 yards and three touchdowns in the Cotton Bowl Penn State defeated Texas 32 six and I hope to saw that Rose Bowl game on NBC in the last second Stanford ups of Michigan 13 o'clock doubleteaming hey Bailey and again Krish coming over from that deep safety spot in perfect position almost had it all intended for David Bailey Bailey having caught 111 times of the last two seasons came into this game with only 21 receptions concentrating on the ground game false probably the fastest man ever to play for Bryant corks team is in there Alabama has been trying to get that inside game done only on a few occasions and you can see the Larry Jacobson is back in their number 75 so after 15 times for 67 yards Davis pitches back to the party 90 to the 25yard logs given branches over there and what a hopper is over there again number 81 and that's the reason why where you keep talking about them trying to get their inside game one up the middle because when you have a simple option offense and they take away definitely take away one of your options such as the fit shot you've got to make the other two options go fighters we just can't believe that quarterback hanging along Johnny Rodgers he is back in there and there's a great gap who will kick them all the way to it Rodgers has won fund returned for 77 yards and a touchdown not calling for the fair catch at the 36 and on a go at the 38 by Spivey that very speedy back we were talking to you about from Montgomery Alabama action will continue here at the Orange Bowl the score the basket Cornhuskers 31 the Crimson Tide of Alabama for me yeah right okay very good Jacobson is our eyes because back in that's about it I've checked with the trainer Rogers is all right right at Glover's all right no other injuries no other injury nebraska jeff has three points in this half but if particularly six minutes and Daniel three parts and if Alabama can't stop them again the corner Peggy throws the ball underneath drop stop by Johnny water in her on his knees Higginbotham was there with him and it was scared down me 12:55 left in this battle for the national championship the Cornhuskers of the West talking to Bob Devaney throughout the week saying what's the difference between this year day jacking with time running out of time gets away from Mickey Mouse rolls across the million hazards man when he caught at the 47 yard line shy of the first time by a yard or two and it will be face down and so deaf youth will come in tight he will go off mckinney will go deep and the Crimson Tide will get their hands on the football one more time Bobby McKinney here's Haley had that kick clock McKenna goes back to the 11 yard line what he caught I can look at any hair beyond balding yeah Mary thank you on the phones upstairs of Alabama comes avocado first antenna at their own 16 my name is el mucho both to the question honey not across the pinyon on his company's door I never look at Musso they're blind to all the great a 25 and Alabama history there he breaks number 57 John Atkins billfish was going on the tackle the recliner came down like the live action David they'll be growing and it there's a flag down on the play no marching back while we wait for a Pete Williams signal it's whether this has been quite a week for the state of Florida and particularly the Miami area the President of India what he brought of West Germany helped him in town Alabama is playing Nebraska in a game of a quarter century there's Johnny Musso on apparently shaken up and hurt and of course tomorrow you'll see it on NBC at 4:30 the Miami Dolphins only in the nice football league for five years and the conference championships against Baltimore has been far away again and the first yard go brave last night walk back to the 15yard line all their life looking on as a personal foul is called against elevated energy I'm just looking at the statistics Alabama is giving 172 yards on the green but only 47 through the air and trailing by a 25 points expect to see Jerry Davis has been quite a bit both down in 25 David davus been hurt and that ring on which option and then look that over a little bit lag when applying come down on that left shoulder not appear to be what the injury was he goes on their foot Thompson who is a junior and he will be coming in an action will continue here at the iron for with this for the Buster 31 at Alabama State eleven minutes eight seconds to play and in the space of a couple of plays Terry Davis has gone out injured he has 64 yards rushing and looting a touchdown Johnny Musso the allamerican halfback has gone out injured option number 17 in one day for a prime card here and won't get away either right down and by Hopkins galettes defensive end and then 28 positions now 31 for six and Davison Musso are on the sidewalk barbie is in number 24 third down and a long long 24 yards to go wheeler goes quite left Alabama be moved here welcome with women like the bank of Tokyo everyone what it is today director Dan back from Earhart Fleming production managers on in Reno the art director all the mayor they are involved in a truck and has come in on fourth down as they refused the penalty for legal motions and then we'll kick it away and back goes Johnny Rogers once again pick driving Rogers back inside the 30 back to the 26 he gave the middle let's meet back up our number 65 buddy Bob very rarely do you see kick returners so consistently good Johnny lodges great burst of speed finally brought down by Buddy Brom first and 10 to midfield the secondary addiction Bronson and Peggy or this trip last year but Johnson Luzerne a great deal of his time tagging took the number one job and started off this way in the Bronston wife Maggie is the senior Patterson getting up very slow they have been bouncing calls decision fathers on the 47 yard line Patterson now stumbling off the field team number 96 taken up on the play the motion on across the football at Alabama cutter at the holy waveguide the allamerican linebacker number 42 for Mount Pleasant Pennsylvania on a team to go another look at it you'll see the ball pop through there in a moment Shirley Alabama senior falling on it my mother okay let's try to get the ball in motion and that's something boring without its number one quarterback and without a tremor one owner and we have to test whether the history of joining them so this is Hobson having the long and exhausting to go anymore and I'm talking about the national championship of the colleges being one here tonight remember tomorrow and I can football confident in his will being again we'll be on NBC tomorrow and fulfilled down the sidelines and accustomed at the watch in the field one particular one by judge white when the 6060 really put a crunching block for rich brother 79 they will get a chance to see it in this replay option going back he'll go off to his left and he's going to come back around keep your eye on number 79 in the white right here at the top your string right there just straighten him up definitely Jack White the Alabama senior on fourth down and three Alabama's pops in his coal trying out and apparently here with the ball not even in the territory of Nebraska Alabama was willing to gamble on fourth down action will continue here at the iron bull with his goal remaining Nebraska 31 at Alabama sick yeah okay in other words you want one play and then that on the 45 yard line of Mollusca both down and three Alabama often tips of all they've got the hearth down and doesn't Alabama with 8 minutes left 31 for 60story National proam the fifties and sixties with us mark the Dean Martin shoes on Oklahoma's 22nd and 23rd doesn't classic next February 12th and 13th we're gonna see you down there what about Johnny Musso and Friday I'm Gary Davis is true from the evening with just under 8 minutes to go as a band the luxury of life pack on it right now Johnny Musso has got with a new recipe he received a cramp in the left leg it could be a hamstring that's it back up to you on the board again and willing to throw down an hour and Jennifer wheeler and there's no girl at the 31 yard line the information the monster man there with him there's grover jackson now on his replacement for me so as one out of the picture number 87 44 comes 5e 24 the offense Alabama thanks for Houston getting good protection as he goes back his problem has done really excellent coverage violet the basket secondary on Amana stuff he rushes on loose on Davis and they're both on the sideline they identified 728 to go this has been an awesome display on the bus trip Donna did get rolling early and the third period and did get one good stuff and the entries to new show em the Davis and the increasing pressure of Nebraska just about stall the Crimson Tide the Oscar stands to win its 23rd in a row without a car loss on its 32nd an almost impossible situation again Willy hop to the right defensive end with the taquerias our 38 career town often back but recovering from behind him going to work and gets inside the 40yard line in here another bike with a lot of scrimmage back to the 39 it would be fourth job in about ten ago fail to make it on fourth down exam and Big E 4 meters first on board navasana and then fourth down Hopson couldn't find anybody open the jaw 7 play on the clock the vespa has the ball and this is a control ball far beneath them simply eat up those minute and bouncing in there he still got the Petrossian man bouncing across the 50yard line not a big defensive end he's tall 63 he's only two under the one pound so he is that because of a defensive reaction usually against that spread option to the Hornets have been able to take advantage without inside reverse earlier really well suck it down and drove with six and a half minutes well moment about cinema 86 that's an excellent play they've looked at successfully to Jerry list earlier in the game he delays at the line of scrimmage let's see defenses he take itself out by just reacting to the normal direction of a play then he releases right upfield their allamerican tackle often for P winner Agee back home lon now looking waving everybody downfield and now may have walking the ball back upfield as the flag is down and they're all running around perhaps and ineligible receiver downfield but no way for the official finally being stepped off making the ball well back in the basket judged right back to the 41 yard line and while dear as you say when a play takes that long to really get a past off usually the linemen moving around they share a quarterback make a move left where that line of scrimmage I think he's going to take it down and run with it and they'll move on itself the line of scrimmage and then lightly and 27 everywhere a Colorado team with winds of mine many Alabama livers twentyeight the mothering halftime lead first off the kid is back inside the temple for Center made to stop this night and when they award the McArthur Kofi their sentiments Alabama anniversary you must agree that the way Nebraska has played an iron and the bench of its national championship jump to the dirt when I without charge governor Wallace of Alabama moments ago you saw the government of Moscow first down in ten was the festival Powell was brought up to the 25 why he goes live at the top of this man now we have mythical and there's the past and there is Anderson stepping up they pick it off and he'll pick up one block up in front trying to get as much ground as he can and out of bounds on the one bouncing pictures about the victim and Don today the Nebraska players are calling the hutt jabba monthly official right off right behind Mike burn number 62 Ranganath are the extra point the boss has been averaging 38.5 points all year long their affiliates more 45 regularseason game the busca ever thought of no one by the brave I forget a thousand tickets they have without them file but about 9,000 more we'll kick it off you can hear the Nebraska man standing the fire ha the basket often Williams have funded again and that they have the football money jumps him in on the track walk along with rich Sanger one of the leading countries on the kickoff team at the 48yard line bugger secondary group never will be back up here you're looking at that lineup I've got men on that Pompeii more check it down and plenty dive down with the hips every 26 yard line a linebacker from Wichita Kansas shy of the first down it will be third down and still without 12 yards to go now I'm calling defensive signals wait a minutes and 20 seconds to go and one way with a job tonight after a tremendous start but mostly just down below ma'am ma'am step makes the tackle of Joel Naboo get that that was David that's not 39 not 34 34 Davis we'll be back next year the county will be barred the DA will be back then that back deal but Joni Mitchell will graduate and Jimmy grandma takes himself out of the game at center Alabama that rain check again now the man has had 12 thirddown situations and only three times as many fish down now it is a fraud on poor and they're going to go for david knapp and that pass the first down I'll say this for the Crimson Tide of Alabama Cal they're not letting the chance the boss was going even more they hold on to the football of new if they can those who file teams came into this game tonight and you were talking earlier about even the sponsors Nebraska say I'm not believing it would be twenty eight nothing at the half I think if the Nebraska plays the realistic they were not expecting to be leading twenty eight to nothing as a half I'm sure they thought they would be leading but by that square I doubt it Jersey on and they all again makes the stop number 40 as he gets across the 25 yard line and now in Augusta manager back at the 35 yard line but warning 22 on the go Alabama tonight not have too much luck better Jones up and down they have completed three passes all night long but from the sophomore from Rapid City South Dakota six feet seven inches tall I'm shaken up on the play well we'd like to thank of course Bob Devaney you'll know the yet motor coach of the year when it's released as for this coach of the year is fine the bus for staff and von Braun is forced information the rector in our congratulations their great performance father the muscadine of course we'd like to vote all day of our board SDM section five in volume you have anywhere love the one and nothing in the nation of western Alabama resulted in all of us to in 1 minute and 33 seconds level button there's Bob Devaney twice my ball valve on Viceroy but 3937 later on Robinson lives in the Liberty Bowl 30:50 destiny and his dad delicately the carpet went back home the brother number 15 one at least 90 yards on that play taking this may not be the game for this afternoon or I should say this ug one under the Alabama and Ray Goldberg is our statistician and hearing examiner's off the veteran stage on the 28yard the gargoyles to the presentment of the national collegiate football champion the national collegiate soccer championship who decided here players tonight Howard University of Washington defeated sent home later period the benefit compared on backing down there after 20 in honor tackling John Peterson the middle guard an Alabama with 42 seconds to go Kyle is going to call timeout and sort of indicative I guess allow the Alabama fans shredded their feelings I'm sure two outstanding teams coming into the game and when it goes that way for one team that and Penn State upset by Tennessee seasons then picking out on Texas this afternoon winning 32 6ly Dale Mitchell ran for 148 yards and 27th but came back and picked a field goal with seconds left you upset home defeated Michigan by the score of Venapro the bruster against number two Alabama and the 42 seconds to go we have a store that has shown us that it hasn't been in doubt since early in the ballgame then the first quarter was 14 and up in the end of a half was 28 could have ended at 38 to 6 right now with 42 seconds left third down and 2 for Alabama option now I'm gonna tell John on those Hudson and there's no a large arrow stop 33 and Jim and I have seen him in town all the week both sides it's like both times red and white color schemes and look like everybody was on the same team red jackets red pants red time 15 seconds left off him back and in a cloud and defended he careened down nearly a yard line the de Klerk one in ten seconds to go second hit for the innovative Alaska the landscape octagon in a very difficult for barrel and walks across the Venus in and Blanche said in the coaches luncheon the other day it would being a long walk did he lose to the body well Bryan has had to take that long walk watching the puddles of national championship game and any orange bowl games won by the score of 38 to 6 has gone into the dressing room here's Paul Bear Bryant here comes in the boss 15 the MacArthur gold well they presented by at any moment my way before 3086 the National Championship has been decided and those belong to the question it really does and I know Nebraska fans not only those who came down there for the game but those across the country particularly those back in the state of Nebraska are quite thrilled probably are saying we told you so and maybe rightly so the rest of the country seemed to acknowledge the fact that they were number one Alabama on the other hand had every right to feel they could challenge and I think up until the game started tonight their record returning foods over worthy challenger the Republic where were they challenge their anyway until the game and I've seen even the best teams I have ever seen have this happened to him and they start collapsing a little bit and things go wrong for them they don't play the type of ball they're capable of playing I say that not to degrade the performance by Nebraska in any respect they put on a tremendous show tonight but I do think we should not forget the great ball that Alabama has played all season long I think they were aware the Challenger was just one of their bad nights and I think the breath could help make it a bad night they said they did if you did not see the early part of a game be aware that the kicking game got alabama down by the score of 21 nothing before alabama ever got a chance but always kick to them they moved it out on their second series of downs they had it Jake get that a high fashion Center could not kick the ball away tried to run with it and was tackled on fourth down advice should say into the third on and then they moved on and with the help of an interference penalty on woody Cox and move the ball down to the two yard line and they moved it on in from there and then of course",

because of Stanford's passing game figuring at the defenders in the secondary of Michigan split second behind and knowing what was going to happen might have trouble staying up with a Stanford

kickoff from you're right Stanford have the choice of jerseys usually the white uniform is the road uniform but they chose white today because they beat Ohio State in white suits last year so we're going to now pause briefly for station identification this is the NBC television network Kurt Goudy and health hero got us back with you in Pasadena neither team is out on the field yet a little bit late I hear Thomas Michigan later across the way it was a come out first Vicky comes out first pampers and comes out and overwhelming roar both the highly emotional both team very exciting courage this is a big quarter for Sam for the first one they've got to do something in the first quarter Stafford and that trouble in your first quarter second quarter has been their best going quarter Michigan has scored best in their fourth Terry Puhl Schembechler has two pedicures physical conditioning and strict discipline as Tom Slade now getting warmed up number 17 you'll be the sophomore quarterback when Michigan gets the ball that you'll be watching breaking out now John Bunce warming his arm up prepuce Anderson 32 will be one of the kickoff return men come on that kickoff team for Michigan will be Darden Dustin bigger gross elliott dayna coin will be the kicker key Sexton Logan Lucarelli Eaton and Dave Eliot Eliot brothers on the kickoff team son a former Michigan football star Pete Eliot who now is assistant athletic director at the University of Miami in Florida miles bores in the middle he's a dangerous man in the kickoff returns miles for the wide receiver takes it on the six there's a rebate reverse and he's dumped he faked it off the wine ferry on a fake press cross at a kickoff return and Stanford has poor field position to start their first series of plays Lucarelli made the tackle it will be stampers ball first down on their 16 yard line Don bunch of the quarterback the running back will be Jackie Brown and Reggie Sanger some Browns 33 Sanderson is 32 Winesburg wide to the right bump going to the air ships at the line of scrimmage in a hard way by Michigan the Stanford being right up the pass with antenna for the sophomore streak John wins berry but Greg Ellis number 68 the middle guard at Michigan in on him more Winesburg the wide man bill Scott 84 is a tide in for Stanford bill Myers is the left tackle 75 younger clipper to left guard 63 Guillen is the center 58 Jones the right guard and Shelley is the right back Stanford offensive unit second down 10 from there 16 yard line regalis again number six year old he hit fun as he was taking the handoff this is the kind of offensive play that's made Michigan what they call the greatest defensive team in the history of Michigan football hurt they using they're using a 53 that man Greg Ellis was playing head up on the center the two interior man next to Ellis plated very wide meaning the village could play that Center oneonone it's tough for a cinderblock a man head up on third down 13 for Stanford from their 13 yard line wings at the jackiebrown up to the fan with a 15 a billet of iron my color the right end number 90 who also dropped back from the Cubs a linebacker and the allamerica middle linebacker Mike Taylor 33 fourth down and 10 to go Steve Murray who's average 37 and a half yards of kick will be back information Tom Darden the allamerican safety man along with Dave Eliot her Roselia Michigan really look powerful on defense in that first series there's the kick a wobbly spiral a fair catch call and a fumble we've got it the three temper gets the first break of the ballgame that first ball and Michigan territory let's watch it again al we're watching Kurt and what actually happened when Stanford took the field they took the sun's that is really no excuse at all this is really a fine football player Tom Darden the big break I've set Michigan up they have carpenter will be playing the wife side of the field 98 in Rambo's at tackle Ellis the middle guard victim the other tackle and Keller is the short side of the field defensive end here's a flip DeWine ferry the sophomore flanker fumbles the ball and Michigan has Roselia star on it Ali everybody covers wines berry have moved inside the 30 fumble it away a tricky play in Reverse going one way to pitch the other way whines buries in good shape to turn over is very unusual for both of these teams Michigan rarely makes mistake they made one but the San free could not capitalize I'd Michigan on her 30yard line is the sophomore quarterback Tom Slade no score in the first period Billy Taylor crackdown on his 32 yard line Billy Taylor who gained 12 hundred and 15 yards this year and carried a ball only an average of 19 plays a game he's almost impossible for one man to stop I think al probably the key of this game is going to the ability to be the ability of 11th tacklers on a Stanford defense their secondary is going to have to make a lot of hits today I told him have gone in now as a flanker here's the option lend out either wing back carrying the ball his coach Jim Becker says daddy is the best allaround player on the Michigan team then he barns the free safety of Stanford made the tackle Michigan's ball now on her own 37 they have a third down and three Michigan curb runs better inside but they decided that Stanford was going to defense them to take away the inside they're trying to go outside they are awesome in the interior that's the game plan the spread Stanford out going outside and come back and inside when they get them spread out third and freeze the pitch they look let's go to the first down the Bob will fall of course destroyed his timing in his momentum on top of him brandi patel and along with greg Sampson the left tackle of Stanford now Barry got sour the punter of Michigan comes on 40 and a half yards a kick this year and Eric cross who has a bad hamstring pull his back to the safety man he's going to try and run back this first putt he doesn't get hurt and he'll stay in there as long as he can as a fun treat earner the kick is away Eric frost falling a fair catch on his 21 yard line so Stanford gained five yards on the exchange of kicks they'll have the ball first down action will continue here at the Rose ball to score Michigan nothing Stanford nothing if you started to put a car together from scratch what kind would you want well you'd want the power comfort and smooth ride of a big expensive car without the big expense and you'd probably want more things like air conditioning tinted glass power front disc brakes am/fm radio to name a few in other words you don't want the kind of car a lot of people would okay you put together this specially equipped 1972 Plymouth Fury and you can get a vinyl roof white sidewalls wheel covers and a remotecontrolled mirror three looks just like would you have mine in the first place see your Chrysler Plymouth dealer about it let's put a fury together together first down for Stanford under 21 they're doing justify what we thought they would wide open stuff against a team that is really strong on the run Michigan Don funk hasn't been a flat ride there's a reversal for wine funny Frank berries brought down in these 24 John Winesburg when the best high school players ever come out of the state of Oklahoma and he's going to be a surefire allamerican if he stays healthy suck a block down by Mike Keller the end and Tom Darden the safety man but he has a knee problem al and he may have to get operated on at the end of the season right Jerry Mike Heller disposed the father that made the tackle the Juara first you've made a fine fight he was the only one that was not fool stayed right with John Winesburg finds berry spreads to the right miles more to the left second down 7 for Stanford that's why then bill stop bill Scott going over the middle not 21 catch of this year he replaced an outstanding tide in five more of last year who caught five balls against Ohio State in the Rose Bowl Tom T the wide linebacker made the tackle and we have a first down now for Stanford our first first down in the game both teams have looked tight on their first series of downs offensively Don bunch go to the outstanding player in the Pacific Coast Conference this year 45 days own 46 bill Scott again a junior from Stockton California good strategy Kirk going with the short passes the defense it's his own the defense of Michigan his home is going against it his tight end very wisely we'll watch for Jackie's Brown he could swing Jackie very easily to the outside and get some pretty good yards number 33 Don punch with those flowing blond locks that stick out of him under his helmet stepped into a big pair of shoes Jim Plunkett Pass is complete the wine fairy sophomore flanker wines buried out of bounds on the Michigan 35 and right now mr. fun says picking them apart Bruce Elliott the wide halfback made the doctor not only is he looking good Curt he's moving so well watch this man move and on the running throwing his back is going underneath his own lines Barry if he stays well this could be really an exciting game dollars down for Stanford on the Michigan 35 we have no score 10:50 to play in the first period Pampers move from their own 21 now in a Michigan territory punch pass block and that was 90 for butch carpenter a senior from Flint Michigan the big line up front at front five second down ten to go Stafford going to the area right from the first play the heart of this defense church Mike terror number 33 tom key number 37 to fine linebackers both they're coming very close to intercept Sanderson are brown they're running back behind Don funds do you NCE but great brought back you can do it all pops out of the hand of Jackie Brown who came out of the backfield number 33 lunch throws to them all Stanford have five receivers who had more catches in the leading receiver on the Michigan team of course Michigan shows you the past but doesn't rely on it now it's third down and 10 he was getting a double flip shirt the man that puts a big rush on him number 33 Mike Taylor from the far side once if 55% of eclasses this year an outstanding physician yeah the quick release is you know if that one's deflected again getting a tremendous rush it was Mike Taylor the linebacker coming through and also Tom Beck the number 99 to tackle fourth and ten and Little Rock Garcia who weighs only a hundred and fifty pounds who kicked ball field goals in any collision this year 14 is now on he hit 14 out of 27 an alltime Stanford and Pacific eight record holding Steve Murray this is going to be a long 152 yards soccerstyle kicker and it is a touch back down Dartmouth back of the safety man so Stanford's Drive of 44 yards stalled by Michigan and the Wolverines take the ball over now on our own 20yard line an action will continue here at the Rose wall to score Michigan nothing and Stanford nothing yeah I am not Zima Carrie Mae the closer you shave the more you need creaming soothing medicated Noxzema George Blanda at 43 is still outperforming the rookie George you sure stay on the young side I can't kick of course it takes sensible exercise and sensible eating like breakfast starting with product 19 a high potency cereal with all the officially established minimum daily adult requirements for vitamins and iron can't kick about the good taste either stay on the young side start with Kellogg's product 19 how Michigan is doing something new they haven't done this year they have to flip receivers in rather to the right hold them to the left the first time they've done it this year this is this fresh Stanford by the air appeal is the quickness linemen on the Stanford front floor he's not a regular he has replaced Roger Khan who's been injured they call them the Thunder chickens of Stanford this one for Samson lavitus mutlar and / all the linebackers will be Pat Moore Jeff seaman the allamerican the middle linebacker Mike Simoni the right linebacker but cloud and Bob net or the half axe barn and modal are the safety man Paul Seymour the big tight end that goes in as a blocker Simoni billy taylor has averaged five and a half yards a carry he hasn't been able to get going so far in this game it is now on the michigan 18 and they have a third and 12 Kirk probably the most dangerous man on the Michigan team could we'll be number 22 Glenn Doughty if Tom Slade puts the Doughty he can do just about everything number 22 once again those two wide receivers Epps dowdy here Slade looking a long path here there's from the end zone this was not a good throw he was throwing behind the man he had good time made hesitation he was a little offbalance when he released you know carried John Ralston said he's got a score more than 17 points and he'll need two touchdowns I'm breaks he's gotten two breaks already a fumble and a new set and Michigan does not make mistakes they averaged only about a turnover and a half all year and only 18 turnovers already in this game Jackie Brown stopped by butch carpenter who's playing a live side of the field and the wide linebacker tom key number 37 he has two brothers who played for Illinois in the Rose Bowl game he did second down well to go so far Stanford has outplayed Michigan we have eight minutes 50 seconds to play in the first period no score they're in a slot right more Winesburg in the same side punch on his rollout wing on the 37 yard line by Frank dusty Jackie Brown an academic allamerican by the way is going to apply at the Michigan law school when you've got John wines berry and miles more both on one side it puts tremendous pressure on the defensive secondary this is why we indicated earlier that punch might be going to his back out of the backfield to go underneath the speed of those two y men Dennis Sheehan over the ball third down for Stanford on Michigan's 37 lines 30 now is moved to the left side and more spread to the right but the flip the line fair hold on that flip to the flanker with an insight rebirth Greg Ellis the middle line man man hit him there the middle guard the loss of the art fourth and five Dave Murray as the man and so is a field goal kicker Chris check I'm great has come in holding will be Marie and Garcia now will be frying a 55 yarder he pried a 52yard or earlier his kick is up and it is short there's two really monumental tasks for a college field goal kicker to try and kick a 52yard er and a 55 yarder coming up next on NBC at 7:45 Eastern Standard Time tonight the two undefeated untied powerhouses Alabama and Nebraska playing for the McArthur Bowl the national championship the unofficial national championship Michigan's balling on their own 20yard line they have a first down nothing nothing the score the left tackle move Jim cook move from Michigan and will be an illegal procedure carried you look at this defense now of Stanford the four three the two quarterbacks both up to the line of scrimmage you've got almost a four five defense Tom Slade they're trying to force him to the air on first down Britt cipher a singer pull back in at shuttlesworth out Stanford ganging up just like this you can expect it nearly a seven eight man front up there to try and stop the run that's why they've had the wide receivers out in practical why just spread them out here's the powers be fulfilled like that in the 17 and I'll say Stanford is doing a superb job so far stopping allamerican running back Taylor Charlie McCloud number 21 the free safety Barnes 29 and that's what we meant about the secondary having to make the tackles today the Stanford secondary has had only four touchdown passes completed against them but whether they could come up and hit hard and make sure tackles will be the key of this game Bull Riders in now as a flanker the tight end seal is come out second down 14 to go the pitch on a reverse the rather the flanker at the 20 ladder is over the 30 and as the first first out of the game for Michigan Bowl rather a junior from Sandusky Ohio picks up the first down this is a pretty play Kurt the left side the right side of Michigan line went out corn turned back Tom coil number 60 whom you will not see get there he is he's making that block good carbo rather he can really fly number 15 Michigan on their 31 yard line with our first first down we have no score 652 to go at Shuttlesworth his powerful sophomore fall back now they're off the wishbone now and as Shuttlesworth was a sophomore game over 800 yards on the ground this year number 31 you'll be hearing a lot of him in his junior and senior years Larry Butler the right guard 73 feet laughs attached the left guard 78 the inside men and the Stanford front four made the tackle rather comes out Oldham goes in Michigan's fall under 34 second down seven no score first period the option play fixing the dowdy by Grieg sense that number 91 from Long Beach who is the biggest man in that front floor here it is again from the end zone this is an outstanding play by Samson there was good room in front of this runner one hand and he close him down let's take a look at this shot here Samson is a real sleeper on a Stanford team a young fella hood now is just gaining real football of Philippi 255 pounds of six feet five and a half we had a flag down on the plate or discussing it and it's being marched off against Michigan this has not been heard of an explosive looking Michigan team they're doing things that they really don't do that well they're much better inside off of the wishbone or the power I where they can really generate that explosiveness that can break a bill Taylor a blocking of the front man either Jeff sieh fourth or edge Shuttlesworth are really the things that make this offense go second down 23 yards to go for Michigan from their 18 yard line they haven't been able to get on track yet offensively the cowboy from Billings Montana has been an outstanding lame in the last year with Stanford in the Rose Bowl and during the season 244 found you know carried his uncle Milan Liza bitch played from Michigan in 33 and 34 he's deceased now so I guess the lives of pitches have a little loyalty going both ways Taylor has been held of five yards rushing and forth them so far and throwing on the run the pass complete to the tight end Seymour was tipped by Randy hotel I'll see more the tight end who caught only five passes all you're really a superb blocking tight end it's 4th down and 11 yards to go now for Michigan and again they're going at pump formation very desire will do the punting Jim Ferguson and Eric cross the double safety washes the mammoth Paul will take it and here's frost about kicked the coverage takes it on the 23 the 2530 goes down and he might have made another five yards that not be lost his footing Tom Coyle who was born in Dublin Ireland made the tackle for Michigan I'm out action will continue here at the Rose Bowl the score Michigan nothing Stanford nothing I'm being taken for a ride a unibody restraint the tightness it's the way Christ build their courage to last longer than ever before run better to like this little 72 Plymouth cricket isn't that the kinda car America once here's the tough goodyear tire with two fiberglass belts big on mileage a wide flat thread big on traction a polyester court body big on strength a Goodyear custom white tread Polly glass tire big on valium and if it doesn't say Goodyear it can't be falling glass President Nixon seats to the Rose Bowl this year have been given to a fella named Michael Dyer a 19 year old sophomore of Long Beach City College the last year pulling the law enforcement officer out of a flaming automobile wreck and saved his life Stanford's ball from her 34 Don bunch Patrol a fast and complete and he was throwing under pressure and the receiver was under the gun too as Beckman put a hard rush to pass with a tenant for Reggie Sanderson that's also the righthalf back Randy Logan who was covering a receiver Stanford runs those backs out a lot they'll have five man past patterns damper now is run 16 plays Michigan 11 Sanford's ball under 34 second down 10 no score four and a half to go in the first period laughs right formation Jackie Brown and the stop 30 37 yard line by tom key the linebacker of michigan number 37 third down seven ago stanford has had three third down opportunities has not converted michigan has had three third down opportunities in his field to move on into a new series of downs michigan has not been in stanford territory on Stanford's been in Michigan territory twice third and seven as Gussie the rover the wolf man had a shot at it but putz was hit if he let that ball go and it was deflected and wobble it was intended for wines berry the flanker John Bunce who's probably been against the hardest pass rush he's had all year you know Kurt when you're offensive than going it sure is great to have a defense in this Michigan team is the defensive team is really holding it all together until Michigan can get something rolling the defense is doing it all and Michigan starts slowly they did the same thing against Ohio State Michigan State this year they were checked in the first three then they got rolling we'll see if they follow that pattern today dave murray a punt formation Tom garden and Bruce LA they're deep for Michigan a little kick darden takes it on his 28th and he's having trouble with he's putting off so and he goes down on the 29 he averaged 10 yards a punt return this year we like to acknowledge at this time many of the Washington Jefferson alumni here at today's Rose Bowl in recognition of the 50th anniversary of W and Jays appearance Annette's Road ballgame Washington Jefferson now an NCAA College Division member played California to a scoreless tie back in 1922 training to W&amp;J fans everywhere into all alumni a fellow through the plate here in the Rose Bowl Ted Shuttlesworth hitting straight ahead the sophomore whose father is a high school principal neither stop five Dean Hanson who's now moved in the interior of the Stanford front for the ball is on the Michigan 34 yard line they'll have a second down and a long five to go Seifer a thinner fullback this is their power i formation they call it deeper by swayed to pitch after Taylor can a break tackles that's especially that's what he really does well he broke the tackle a Randy Hotel the safety man you're right this is what he does so well he's done low center of gravity Pato comes up number 36 gives him a shoulder but really doesn't go through this man little head faked helped a lot too they say he's almost impossible for one man to bring him down and he showed his tackle breaking ability there Michigan's second first diving on their 43 yard line then daddy driven out of bounds on his 47 dowdy a double threat man receiving a ball and running it he had a knee injury last year he missed the Rose Bowl gamer year before last of the sophomore penny Barnes made the hit on him Jeff's ypres thoose gone into the game for ED Shuttlesworth number 32 is a better blocker than Shuttlesworth Shuttlesworth probably a better runner number 32 pay a fine bark on the last four my golden now is a wide receiver to the right Michigan starting to roll second down six from their 47:54 Billy Taylor way in the Sanford territory the first time Michigan has crossed the 50 yard line during the first period you're now on the Stanford 47 all right close to the first down Jeff seaman fine middle linebacker number 92 let's watch it he was allamerican moving with that play getting the good inside outside angle that's the way you make the tackle motion Becker says Mike Taylor is the best middle linebacker in America John Ralston says my man Jeff Siemens the best middle linebacker in America they both made all the allamerican team number 92 on Stanford seaman number 33 on Taylor all right Michigan has the ball now for a first down on the Stanford 47 yet Shuttlesworth goes in at fullback replacing Chris Paul steel goes in as a tight end and Paul Seymour comes up make his ground attack just starting to move fullback Shuttlesworth to the 45 a Stanford he's piled up there by Pete Lazar Phipps number 78 that front of Stanford is hitting well and then moving very rapidly to the outside Michigan will have some success with their back starting out then cutting back Shuttlesworth's coming out Seaford number 32 going in see for the fine blocker they're alternating fullback setting plays and now cipher of those in number 32 second down eight Michigan on Stanford 45 no floor near the end of the first period fakes in a pullback and played his rough back up a Michigan 48 yard line er 49 on a great charge by Pete Lazich itch again number 78 hey I'm sorry that's what we were talking about watch them get off the ball quick there's life at age 78 that was the bus to play the Senate it never did get out to block on him my decision easy play play loss this yard is third and 14 lavitus now has three solo tackles today and two assists they've got a job in this burg period in the last minute of the first race play gets away good runner it's been a 40 that's a big play for Michigan right there he was trapped back that he's old 45 yard line his own running ability set that went up that could be a big play in his birth that Jeff seaman number 92 was blitzing Kurt look at him come in here he reaches out you're right this is a very big play this is the kind that can really break the heart of a defense and as you say Slade knows what to do with that football when he runs good runner Michigan now on the stand for 34 yard line with a first down 25 seconds to go in the first period no score the power i formation played the Shuttlesworth will blast forward to the Stanford 30 second down six the gold Michigan Boyle the Garth Tucker the tackle leading the way second down six and the clock shows that's the end of the first quarter in the 1972 Rose Bowl game with a score Michigan nothing and Stanford nothing Kurt Goudy and Alvaro goddess they're your first downs we're going into the second period this is Michigan's deepest penetration they're rolling on the ground now but on a third down play with slate 17 yard scamper that set up this threat rip Cypress to pull back check that Shuttlesworth Billy Taylor Baylor going to the 23 yard line of Stanford he's tackled five Bennie Barnes number 29 and helped by Mike Simoni actually cared there was a missed tackle by Tim Rob net number 42 Tim was trying to play the block off of a big Edie Shuttlesworth and he is so big really I think he just killed a view for the for the cornerback the first down Michigan understand 4:23 Kelly Taylor drops at the 19yard line and he's it's terrified people as it it's been robbed at helping him it's over the 20 let's put it on the 19 second down six Michigan going with a basic ground game they've been a new playing was type with the fullback replacing Shuttlesworth this is a timeconsuming Drive that Michigan has put on for the big third down play by the quarterback Tom slave blasting straight ahead to the 16 yard line with Greg Sampson the left end Jim Merlot the left linebacker number 54 was now him from Sanger California problem of Stanford script might well be those two linebacker if you were just talking about Merlot 54 Mike Simoni 50 the big guy in the middle the allamerican Jeff seaman is a very fine football player but those corner linebackers are going to have to do a big job on those slam from the outside third down three to go Shuttlesworth Taylor are ready so scouting in the backfield to pitch out if the Taylor goes to the 14 yard line he may be short of a first down Billy Taylor they faked the Shuttlesworth up the middle and then sent Taylor why this is a good tackle Randy portal number 36 ground level view moves right up looks like he's going to hit him high then very wisely goes down right at his feet fourth down a yard to go for Michigan Michigan has 72 yards in the ground in the first a Stanford just ate there your third down play the fourth down Cyprus is to pull back they're going for it now they give it to Taylor and I believe he made it they had a flag down though penalty marker dropped on the play offside Stanford that'll be a first down and goal ago now Michigan's ball on the Stanford nine this drive started on the Michigan 29 and they've had one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 plays in this Drive Shuttlesworth the tailor behind the quarterback slay first down nine to go for a Michigan touchdown Taylor stop at the 850 for Jim merlot on top but he was nipped underneath who got underneath the plate there he is number 73 Larry Buckner a junior of Lakewood California occur with the concentration of Stanford in the middle it won't surprise me at all if Tom Slade fakes that handoff and keeps it by himself to the wide side of the field no score early in the second period Michigan with the biggest threat of the game now second down eight to go for a touchdown Kelly Taylor drag down at the 7 and 91 Greg Sampson floating down that offensive left in Stanford going against the team that has averaged 69 rushing plays per game at the new Big Ten record broke the record held by Ohio State 69 team 341 yards on the ground by Michigan this year four games a new Big Ten record which broke the old mark set by Ohio State of 1968 third down seven to go for a Michigan touchdown now they spread out a little bit Shuttlesworth to pull back your slate on a roll out then around his jumper mic Simoni the junior right linebacker of Garden Grove California we missed the Rose Bowl last year because of a bad knee getting his revenge today I'll tell you Kara this defense has really been doing a great job that Samson 91 has impressed me tremendously Dayna coin hit 54 out of 54 X 2.6 here and 712 field goals now we'll try a 30yard fills all the Slade holding the kick is up and it is and that's the new Michigan alltime career and season field goal mark 8 for the season Dana cloying to Michigan action will continue here at the Rose ball to score Michigan 3 Stanford nothing oh yes yes my antiperspirant works when everything is going okay but when I'm a nervous wreck nothing seems to get me try if your antiperspirant doesn't do what you're hired it to fire yours and hire ours right guard antiperspirant get the drying agent that really helps keep you dry stops odor but I'm what you call a heavy perspiring I perspire in the wintertime then fire yours and hire ours ours is right guard raise your right hand repeat after me I John Brodie hi John Roy we have switched to Gillette Platinum Plus fish to Gillette Platinum Plus play because they shave me closer and with more comfort closer and smoother no wait that's how they shave me yeah that's not the way I said it John yeah but I'm the quarterback mmmhmm Gillette Platinum Plus double edge or injector with platinum smooth edges for a smoother shave show the Platinum Plus injector plays John there smoother too not to mention more comfortable okay I won't mention it John let me explain something to you you can see there's John Rolfe in the Stanford coach white Michigan has big Perth pick fourth quarters before they grind you down they kept that ball 17 plays and they had it eight minutes and 19 seconds in that drive eight minutes and 19 seconds here's the kick now by Dana coin is flipper bounding around picked up by Miles born he's 16 to the 24 to the 25 thumbs up and there's a fumble and Michigan has recovered Dayna coin well if you ever had to pick the wrong time the fumble that was absolutely the wrong is never a good time but this was really a bad time the momentum was going the other way miles more fumbles Michigan recovers they're back in scoring position they just can't make mistakes against this Michigan team Michigan make two mistakes early in the game very unusual for them first down on the 32 yard line it blasts through the head Billy Taylor don't look like they're making much for their brief courtyards are the crack that's the tight end Paul seal coming in replacing the wing back Glenn dowdy anymore blocking power in second down seven to go from Michigan understand 4:29 dope dealer on a fish beautiful play Miami hotel that's the way to come up one on one and make that tackle the Van Nuys California sophomore Stanford has only two starting sophomores in their lineup today wines buried a planter and post elder safety man now interesting the carrot the Michigan has not been successful going wide their success has been inside using the man the wishbone trapping the blocking on the end of the linebacker third and ten Michigan on a Stanford 32 laid on a drop back fires and it's complete at the 20 you know slide their success has been inside using the man that wishbone trapped in the blocking on the end of the linebacker third and ten Michigan understand 432 blade on the drop back fires and it's complete at the 23 yard line of debt for the Glenn Doughty and went down and just came back to the ball Wade has had a four for seven figures 44% not four but not outstanding he just hasn't thrown the ball that much and an FIR doesn't go to the air they now have a fourth down in a yard to go on the 23 yard line of Stanford they get Shuttlesworth in there a fullback Seymour and seal the two tight ends to block they're going and he has met and it's gonna be very hater here is stop short of the first down you gotta give that Stanford offense credit they're giving at Michigan running game all they want today we have a timeout action will continue here at the Rose Bowl the score Michigan three Stanford nothing I'm kind of hungry I sure look forward to getting away things are simpler Bobby even got me to have his Kellogg's cornflakes and out there well they fit a good taste a simple food uncomplicated all the good things seem to be that way how big you think that fish was your Kellogg's cornflakes it was pure simple the best things usually are probably Plymouth's more police cars in the United States our Plymouth Fury than any other car maybe but you can have one of these 72 Fury without the special police equipment but built by Chrysler Plymouth with the same thing in mind to make sure all of their new cars run even better and longer than ever before I think that's the kind of car America wants the biggest play in this game the third down Michigan fall there 49 Michigan quarterback slate hit behind the line of scrimmage got away went into Stanford territory picked up a first down at the end of that Drive Michigan kicked a field goal there's a good hole open for the 28 yard line with Mike Taylor making the tackle on Jackie Brown and running back Yakima Washington a senior Michigan has changed that defense a bit defining a lot more for the pastor playing a very wide front ordinarily to play a very tight five to paying what is now a 43 second down six Stanford on their 27 trailing three nothing 752 to go at quarterback Don bucks brought down on these 29 yard line by Fred Rambo number 92 Junior third down four to go for Stanford what's grandpa well he's right on the center courage they're moving into a nod they're playing for the past we were talking about how difficult it is for a senator block by himself it's awfully difficult tennessean number 58 at a tough time third down for for Stanford bunch has had a hard rush on him gets protection and threw the ball the number 37 Michigan's 37 Tom key and is he unhappy right into his hand once force that fast he really forced that one and I imagine John Ralston gonna talk to him when it goes to the sidelines he intercepted two passes this year Stanford 0 for 5 and 3rd time plays Michigan only 1 out of 7 neither Club has been able to convert their third down attempts fourth down four to go Stanford now information Tom Darden and Bruce Elliott back deep from Michigan we're midway in the second period with Michigan ahead three nothing hitting a tough battle from the underdog Stanford team hello get this is a dangerous kick Darden takes it on to 25 fumbles of all and gets it back to the 29 he's had trouble handling punch today an allamerican safety man this year one of the best in the country tomorrow at 4:30 al DeRogatis and I will be in Miami for the Miami Dolphins and the Baltimore Colts for the American Football Conference championship game what a game has should be we're still trying to recover from the Miami Kansas City game 82 minutes 40 seconds tomorrow 4:30 on NBC society by first is the pull back there the counter and blend on either wing back takes the ball brings it out to the 37 yard line in Michigan where he was hit by Randy pulled tell who now has made his fifth unassisted tackle of the game second down three to go from is my golem is the flanker left been leading three nothing in the first half and they're really keying on Taylor today that's Merlot the left linebacker with replay we don't know whether there's anything wrong with Pat Moore not the starting left linebacker but Merle has played a lot here in the second half that was good blocking actually curve but that whole defensive unit moves to the ball extremely well they show it right there this linebacker Moreau has been moving extremely well he's been alternating third with Pat Moore third down about a yard and a half the Gopher Michigan on their 37 for the 41 yard line Billy Taylor the air Perrault made the tackle Stanford had a ball only one minute and 22 seconds this period Michigan with real fall control and Curt they stay with that ball control they're really disciplined yeah sit up here and you have the feeling that it must be very tempting on first and long a first and ten rather not to go the air all right Michigan's first down in there 42 yard line wait stumbles across his 45 yard line I think his knee went down there at the 45 at Michigan he was tripped up by people as a pitch the left guard of Stanford second down free to go the last time they had the ball they went over eight minutes with it they ran 17 plays he started his drive on her own 29 now they're on here 45 fabric and score because it can't get the ball my colon flanked to the left here's the wishbone now aside for the front man to pull back the pitches to Taylor Taylor ham dinner the left halfback which came up and played that way well and he's half backs of Stanford al cloud Robinette hotel the safety man and Barnes a safety man have played excellent offensively coming up to make tackles in the secondary but had to be a key for them today you're right Kurt and he played all Fritz cipher printed six when he's 220 pounds and Charlie McCloud is six foot in 193 outstanding play by McLouth dowdy spread to the right rather to the left third and eight Slade the throw flips it out incomplete without a yellow pad he was open in front of McLeod went down hooked back and a good pass would have found him now if any stops our thumbs in married ops are to do the punting up fourth and eight Michigan leading three nothing there's Ferguson number 24 Erik cross number 40 Quinn safety no win right now just a perfect day here temperature 70 degrees in Pasadena this file Rossini's 1315 and jumps on these 19yard down there to cover that kick number 15 is bow rather than junior flanker we have a timeout actually will continue here at the Rose Bowl the score of Michigan three Stanford nothing here's a tough goodyear tire with two fiberglass belts begone mileage a wide flat tread they gon traction a polyester court body and big on strength the Goodyear custom white tread poly glass tire big on valium and if it doesn't say Goodyear it can't be poly glass all my life I dreamed of owning a Mercedes Benz finally bought an old 190 SL roadster and restored it one day believe it or not a tree fell on it with us Jones t me and he was very apprehensive he wasn't sure if his loss was covered or not they made the settlement at under 15 minutes and it was quite fair I know a customer's car is a very personal thing it's my job to hear them that they are in good hands with Allstate it was nice to find a company that treated you like a human being instead of like a computer punch card and this second period Michigan has had 19 play Stanford only for a total of 38 for Michigan 24 for Stanford in the game Stanford deepest penetration has been to their own 29 yard line here in the second third this can't get it moving now Paradis a miles more he cut that ball at his 44 for a first down mild for gets by Randy Logan it's a good move Kurt when you're going against that zone you try to beat it with the quick slant bunts picked it out nicely miles more good catch let's take a look at miles more the top receiver on this team yet a brew spinal cord last year I missed most of the season he dangers after he catches the ball on the 34 yard line Banford ball fourth down with a 15 yard pass great ahead they go running Jackie Brown are running Sanderson number 32 bull machine backward on the phone to his press box to his fighters up there saying what Stanford doing Dave Gallagher and Sedalia he's lost 40 pounds he jocks three miles every day since his heart attack he's in prime shape now second down seven ago Stanford on here 37 3 nothing Michigan whips it out tips away tom kean otherwise that ball would have been complete he picked it just in time it was intended for the tight end bill Scott kurz thing we want to remember is when you're playing ball control you've got the score Michigan has scored only three points Stanford is very explosive miles more has an incredible average on his touchdown passes and he can really move so can John wines very 26 let's watch for him Glenn stones in a tight end replacing stop third down seven Stanford from their 37 plenty of time and you threw it too hard it was nearly grabbed off by gusting the wide man this should've been three or four balls shipped in their hands in a secondary they've failed a whole lot do you think butts firing that ball too hard maybe a shortrange passive L yeah I think so Kurt he's also a little uncertain he's not quite picking out that receiver as quickly as we know he can there was actually two receivers in that same area so it's probably a bit of a broken play three minutes and eight seconds to go and a half Steve Murray of confirmation Darden and Elliot deep for Michigan on their own 20yard line whoa coaches don't like that receivers do Darden and the 2025 and to his 29 those low kicks are ahead of the coverage so Michigan will put the ball in play first down under 29 action will continue here at the Rose ball to score Michigan three Stanford nothing do you ever have trouble starting your car on a rainy day well it could be because your ignition system got wet underneath all this water there's a brand new electronic ignition system it's available on every v8 engine chryslerplymouth makes for 1972 it won't short out no matter besides giving you fixed

better than any they've ever built like this 72 Plymouth Satellite isn't that the kind of car America once I think so especially on a rainy day repose briefly for station identification this is the NBC television network Kurt Goudy and now zero got a sack with you in the Rose Bowl game Michigan first down in their twenty nine three minutes to go and a half wave running out of the pocket he's good it says at the 30 25 40 it's been Michigan's best play today broken play late pick one up 17 yards us in the most important play of the game this was for 11 and let's watch email from the endzone Kurt and that fella total Randy number 36 he looks like he's all over the field coming from the offside that's good tackling that's good first down Michigan from their 40 bowl rather running a reverse and down he goes on his 43 yard line it's down by Patmore de I was gone back in his linebacker and Charlie McCloud or and his bragging there excuse me who's come in now at left halfback allamerican guy Renji a Reggie McKenzie was leading away that time Tom Slade ran boat right there on an in patter in the last time down in there this fellow number 15 could move he can go deep very well under two minutes to play and a half second down seven and he's down on his 47 he's if they're by John Ferguson number 70 and the kitchen also tripped him up mrs. Michigan's 11 third down opportunity hit only two out of ten so far give it the Goudy and he on that second effort he made it he moves in the FAFSA territory as a fan for 48 with a minute five seconds to go in the half Michigan leading three nothing timeout all five Michigan so they'll have two left North seniors the South senior the Senior Bowl on NBC two o'clock Eastern 10:00 of time Saturday January 8th you know Michigan came out here and change their preparations in the Rose Bowl game this year they did not screaming year before last they worked twice a day scrimmaging they were flat floating to the fourth Jim Becker even though he just misses a heart attack we had this year he's taking it much easy with his fly but he says that no team in a ball game can be as good as they are in a regular season the most important thing of a bowl game is morel try carrion I think is awfully difficult also to conclude a season then wait a month and the play a big game hike the ball game and try to retain your concentration the timing of Michigan has been off Stanford has been a little better defensively neither team has lost fullfilling fine jack sanford has a ball only few minutes 39 seconds in the second period Michigan has completely dominated play and yet Michigan has only three points they're leading three nothing snappers made the big defensive play when they've had to all right it's 1st down Michigan now on the Stanford 48 a minute five seconds remaining in the half blade is gonna throw and he hit down he goes back in his 48 yard line with Greg Sampson in on him number 91 Sampson a quick charge a big boy gets across the line Meagan lining up now without a huddle 45 seconds to go they're under 48 second and 14 and a prearranged play throws that one and he was hit again and knocked down by Larry Butler that time with a great guard pass intended for rather but Butler reached the passer and belted him down third and 14 Butler 73 you can be sure ball would like to get a score here Kurt he's been forcing it a bit this is Slade been forcing it a little bit he could screen Michigan does not like the screen very much they need about Oh a good 15 yards to get into territory for Dana coin and they put my golem in as a wide receiver replacing rather they have dowdy out of once I hear the third and 14 that pass is tipped it's incomplete Jennifer daddy they have fallen interference down in the 35 yard line when Donny was interfering with which is a big break for Michigan but 36 seconds to go in the half because otherwise they had a fourth down play coming up I leave we might be able to see this there's Doughty allaround good football player they didn't miss that with good thing no they have no interference call it's an incomplete call we saw it interferes they dropped the flag but evidently of dropping a marker probably tops our information is fourth down yes there's a reason for that the ball was tipped on too fast so there was no interference call a different rule in college didn't you see in the professional game the ball was tipped before it got to the receiver so 32 yard punt stanford has the ball now in our own 20yard line with 31 seconds remaining in the half michigan free stanford nothing let's see what Stanford does now they say that fun skirt cannot throw the long ball we have not as yet seen him try to go up top lines very can really move out of there miles more can really move out of there we may have an opportunity to see how far number 11 can throw it an firts made only 30 yards in the ground Michigan's made 131 yards in the ground the Michigan dominating on the ground but playing at faith and Reggie Sanderson the fullback up the middle Mike Keller the defensive ride in a Michigan made the tackle here's your clock moving 15 seconds remaining in the half 3nothing Michigan offense is going deep the wines bearing over his head and the clock stopped the six seconds to go why is berry has a cartridge if justin has emerged a little bit and now and then it pinches a nerve a flea Johnny Ralston says he believes you'll have to get operated on in the end of the season he runs 100yard dash in 97 and Ralston says he's going to wind up with one the best football player Stanford ever had coming up next on NBC at 7:45 Eastern Standard Time Nebraska Alabama in the Orange Bowl stay tuned right after this game for the Orange Bowl Nebraska and Alabama third down three to go for Stanford this may be the last play of the half bunch of passing pattern into Michigan territory the 47th of the clock shows at the half has run out when we talk about all of the different species let's have forget ourselves you and I the people around us and the people all over the world every one of them wants to live once too long and wants to enjoy life as we do perhaps then this is the great lesson when each of us can truly live in peace with his own kind then we will finally be able unselfishly to show our world with every living thing music we get ready for the second half kickoff in the 1972 Rose Bowl game and more of the sensational need for being able to set the golfing world on fire by winning the US Open all in the space of 19 days is just 14 feet away from Fort Myers nobody gonna get a citation yeah no legal Ryoga well sheriff I was hoping it was gonna be mine well that is Hillary well that's the prize right here the family to dodge Monaco now if you'll just let me put this let you convict them in there hey Holly dude that's dodge sprinkler and it's got pushing quiet right you put beauty and dependability in the same deluxe package Dodge depend on it there are the stats for the first half and they're really no surprise though than the fact that Michigan is not scored and Stanford is not we start the football game saying that one team like the fast the other team like the run well Sanford has gotten no first downs throwing the football Michigan has gotten eight as far as the past is concerned it's a little bit reversed five for Stanford first downs passing none from Michigan there are the rest of them hurt the second half should be exciting both teams were extremely tight we said that Michigan really comes on in the latter part of the game but we have to also remember that if you're playing ball control and I will repeat you've got the score especially against the team they can throw as well as Stanford taking a ball control Michigan had the ball 21 and a half minutes I'm rounding at our 21 and a half minutes so eight and a half minutes for Stanford yet the score is Michigan 3 and Stanford nothing once the 7 out of 7 teams played 2 out of 6 and now Michigan is going to receive they have the option the first choice they're the second half they're going to have bowl rather Billy Taylor and Glen dowdy back rather on the goal line and rod Garcia who likes to kick thus quiver let's see if he does we'll be kicking off read nothing Michigan Curt Goudy Aldi regardless Happy New Year as we head into the second half a hundred and three thousand fans jammed into the beautiful Rose Bowl perfect weather at Pasadena coming to rather on the nine he's to the 20 finds daylight rips it out a good return for fall that's his night kickoff return of the year the average 20 yard to return the charities if I Dan Thomas of Michigan's ball first down now near 39 yard line they'll have time Slade the sophomore premed student Saginaw Michigan incidentally the other quarterback Don bunts wants to be a doctor later salya Torian of high school class tie first is the fullback hitting straight ahead Cypress goes to the 45 a six yard game second down and four the air they're all made the tackle for Stanford now Shuttlesworth brings the play in a pull back for Michigan I want you think Kurt Michigan is set at alltime school record of 409 points this year and they hadn't been on the board except for the field though you got to give spam for plenty of credit Shuttlesworth ahead to the 50 now al it looks like they're going with straight ahead raw power here at the opening of this second half it's been their game all year right Kurt against this poor man look that they're getting from Stanford and they're playing it rather why the success that Michigan had in the first half was running inside those defensive end they'll probably stay there first down measurement and for Michigan to five for Stanford Michigan's ball on their 49 yard line Sanford has Samson Lazar ditch Butler they're all up front late on the option then bow he goes to the 45yard line I'm loyal the right guard pulled for him as Jeff seaman the middle linebacker 1/2 yards to go for a Michigan touchdown this could be a call that we're going to remember Kurt they're in there tight I don't know whether Michigan's pride has been hurt but that nation's defense there's something up big play all right fourth down Michigan leading three nothing Dillon 1/2 yards to go for a touchdown they must make the title hipster Stanford you'll have a timeout and actually Google here goal the floor Michigan three Sanford pest all state life insurance says if you die young men we can help you make certain that little boy of yours won't go under all state gives you 32 thousand dollars of 20year decreasing term protection if you're 28 for example you pay just $10 a month when it comes to guarding your family young man you're in good hands with Allstate today's lesson is on shaving the closer you shave the more you need creamy soothing medicated Noxzema running teams in America had a crack inside the 5 and couldn't go over plastic goal line spam by Stanford therefore one but the fullback Reggie Sanderson who lives two blocks in the Rose Bowl reared here in Pasadena Rambow Ellis Beckman piling the play up the middle of the Michigan front five hits on the two yard line Stanford has a second down and nine breach brought the gamble Kurt they've got the two wide receivers to one side the double Nam whines Barry Moore could be a big man second of nine the throw is a pass out I feel that dine with Jackie Brown Bruce Elliott the defensive halfback now the balls on the stand for 10 the third down and a yard to go 844 to go in the third period Michigan ahead three nothing a play is brought in Romney Stanford bench the big third down play great they want this a one good field position if they have to punt out of here Michigan again has good field art smiley a fat in butter and third and one in a pass for most of the good runner well you may have it going to be very close he was hit by Mike Taylor Michigan's allamerican linebacker number 33 who led Michigan in tackles it's a sample first hour and they get just a bit more of breathing room their second first down since the first failure first time which converted a third down play into a first down miles more goes to the right John's wines buried to the left Stanford's ball under 12 with a first down 31 Mandy Logan with facts coming out of the backfield very effective on the short ones in front of the Michigan zone it's unusual to see Mike Taylor 33 missing tackle but we're going to have a good opportunity to see it here good play call this bus shows me something very cool laid it there this tackle by Mike unusual we asked John Ralston about funds comparing him to Jim Plunkett he said there is no other Jim Plunkett but if this boy is good look at that pass the sophomore wives berry running a closer under the gun of proof Elliott held on to a winery the sophomore streak he'll be dangerous in the Pacific agent into the air Terry they're really picking this pretty defense apart right now funds pulling some excellent play first down Stanford under 47 they've come from their own oneyard line very day that was a plan play a quarterback draw the broken player running it's an excellent play Kurt he's playing the man over the middle notice Ellis goes one way a fine block by she she in the center and the tackler gives him about three more yards on that now this was a 57yard right a Stanford has going worse down in a Michigan 42 but couldn't find anyone open Brett bramble wrapped him up on the Michigan 44 yard line but a flag is down turned again we repeat ball control is a beautiful game if you score if you don't score you've got problems the zone is being beat in several ways punches beating it's short as Curt called it with the back coming out of the back we will probably see that again if we do more than likely we'll see it to the far side of the field the zone is covering deep giving short the offside penalty declined Stanford lost it down Stanford's ball of the Michigan 40 for second and 12 the other scores today in the Sugar Bowl Oklahoma beat Auburn 4222 Penn State ran away from Texas 32 6 the Orange Bowl follows this one on NBC Nebraska and Alabama second down 12 John Bunce gifted quarterback following in the big shoes of Jim Klecan dancing when ferry the sophomore again with a well hey the great look at young kids yeah boy care he sure isn't Bruce Elliot was right with him look at look at the poise of that Bell right there let's watch wine very all alone now runs 197 an outstanding athlete made that first step good hands and he looked the ball right into his table jennifer has a first down 13yard pass play that's where now on the Michigan 31 bus was hit 11 out of 21 for 150 yards last year Jim Plunkett's performance earned him the alltime Rose Bowl quarterback award as Tom Slade the quarterback at Michigan watching once operate now here's their first shift they've had this is a power I the flag here running the ball they put him in a running back that time Mike Keller made the stop on him mr. Finch Stanford's deepest penetration since early in the first after now on the 28 yard line in Michigan second down seven Stanford has brought this ball from their one yard line to the Michigan 28 Michigan had poor cracks inside the Stanford 5 and fail to score 554 to go in the 3rd period Michigan ahead three to nothing second down 7 maybe too much time with somebody moved let's see too much time probably trying to get an honorable going here at the line of scrimmage and just couldn't click it off fell this will carry the ball back to the 33yard line I made a statement and I think maybe is misunderstood I got a couple of wires on I said staffer can't win the little ones we had no that was a tongueincheek stay but no disrespect meant to San Jose State who had one of the greatest upsets of the year and richly deserved it or Washington State the teams that the Stanford was favored against we didn't mean any disrespect for those fools honestly right Kurt Duke was one of the team to be a high school well deserved that was laid in there perfectly by God but a perfect sideline pass now pun says a quick release he doesn't throw the sideline passes hardest one cat this hey this fella Kirk is really showing us a lot for backers commend us respectful everything you can't rule that fast you can throw any of them rush now in the 25 of Michigan third and four Jim Becker said that funds would be the best quarterback Michigan with play this year and he's right there's an open field Bruce Elliot and the open field pass with a Jennifer miles bar and now the little field goal kicker rock Garcia comes on he can be erratic he missed five field goals against San Jose State and he'll turn around and drives them through Steve Murray will hold for him this is a 42 yard field goal attempt he's had a 52yard er Friday they have 55 yarder and there's another long run it could tie the game if he makes it his kick is up it's got the distance the game action will continue here at the Rose Bowl the score Michigan three Stanford three got here opium take a look brandnew dodges aw Cornett custom target hardtop and a cornet wagon I think they come this is it hey Michelle foot

Michigan 25 and then the field goal here's the kick or rather on the oneyard line this money and brings it back to a 29 yard line downfield to cover steve bourie and also number 61 feet handsome north and the south seniors will be meeting in the Senior Bowl Saturday January 8th on NBC heard there was an inquiry about the decals on the helmet the decals on the Michigan helmets are for the big plays made by the Michigan people's worth the price of this dirty Barry Reynolds now in it guard underneath the play stopped him on the 32 Stanford now as a hundred and sixty yards passing today and just 47

Michigan under 36 Glenn Doughty Downey trips away fine run by Glenn dowdy he's out on his 48th and he has the first down created a couple of people the offensive line does a good job the bottom of the wish cipher 32 there is leading and then dowdy this is a fine runner pictures holds very well time for a good block it's good running good balance for 14 to play in the third period this game is tied three to three Kjetil versus the fullback of the wishbone dowdy carries Dowdy's to the Stanford 48 once again Barry Reynolds who's now in there for Larry Butler making the tackle second down six to go for the Michigan Wolverines they're on the Stanford 48 yard line they have been pi32 three here in the third period second man through as to the 46 is Billy Taylor hit by Jim radness there right halfback Bill Taylor Curt has 32 touchdowns one more and he ties the great Tom Harmons record of 33 as yet he is not scored that 32 is a career number 32 touchdowns third down and four there's Billy Taylor the alltime yardage career leader of the University of Michigan played on the keeper and played running has really helped Michigan today as a first down he's made some he plays running that ball on the quarterback keeper and on a broken pass play Jeff seaman the middle linebacker the air they're all made the tackle now Michigan's at sixteen thirddown opportunities today and has converted five of them Gary Coakley now thirdstring split in has gone in his Michigan's ball on the Stanford 41 Coakley and oldham are the two wide receivers that trying to spread them out they have not used two wide split man here's a pitch shot perfectly the tailor didn't look perfect but he let it go at the perfect time the ball a little high Taylor who didn't have possession when he started out but Benny Barnes and Chuck McLeod driving Billy Taylor out on the stand for 37 yard line a gain of four second down six for Michigan once again Kerry Misha Stanford is giving ground giving Brown grudgingly but as yet Michigan has not been able to get the touchdown hopefully it's the one side all them still the other Billy Taylor may have right on the stand for 35 a gain of do now here's that third and four play again and the two tight ends going in now see more and she'll be in there dowdy comes out hopefully comes out they've got some blocking power in third and four run it right at the 31 they'll have to measure this well towel in on that tackle he's had seven solo tackles today Lanza test has had six finally a measure here Michigan has really played to some backtoback crowds here their last two games 104,000 against Ohio State on November 20th last November 20th and that's the largest crowd in the history of collegiate football and here they are playing in front of 103,000 the day here they are a third short yardage doubt he's got back in now it's gonna be interesting to watch the man at the head of the eye if he slams in the eject number 32 secret they tailor the landing ball carrier in the game with 71 Seifer is the pullback in the power I Taylor is a tailback and Doughty there's the wing back fourth and inches look at Stanford they have nearly a nine man front so they're going wide behind the line is trimming a cloud gamble shot through was going so hard that he over Rani let's watch it here watch 21 on Stanford L + 32 Kurt ciphers is leading to play pours a little wide tackle should have been made good cut here he does it very well Bill Taylor I was a big play Michigan's on the Stanford 28 yard line with a first down another long grinding timeconsuming drive by Michigan banner goes to the 23 yard line Billy Taylor Barbican Ohio and the citizens of his hometown today duckin collection up and sent his mother out here like a watch so she can watch her

straight runs it to the 17 is Stanford you may have a first down Larry Butler brought him down there with pause briefly for station identification this is the NBC television network they're going to measure the play that's worked the best as we wait for this measurement the command the plaintiff has worked the best that a long single yardage has been that straight up died by Shuttlesworth and he's in there now 31 there's the measurement they have it first down Michigan on the fan 4:17 Michigan's played in the first Rose Bowl game against Stanford 19 to Michigan had 13 men they brought out here only 11 played the other two rolled themselves in the dirt after the game they looked like they played when they were driven in a horsecarriage back to their hotel behind the line is pretty we're all heading Taylor was blocking falling Larry Butler finally made the stop at the 10 here it is again from the end zone dowdy is showing you something good balance he's making some crucial yards couple of arm tackles hurt Stanford could be tiring and that's the end of the quarter the third quarter of the 1972 Rose Bowl game with a store at I bet he does bring Stanford three I'm Tom Gaylord from Notre Dame and I'm concerned about the youth of America and rightly so because this is how I got my start just as many American athletes on the playground playing games today I'm involved in a more sophisticated and glamorous games college football however I'm afraid the youth of America are playing a different game a game that involves the use of drugs college football requires a great deal of mental and physical discipline if you use drugs you don't allow yourself a fair chance to obtain these discipline the youth of America has a great deal to offer and a great deal to contribute so give yourself a fair chance to compete in the game of life stay away from drugs race hitting announcement made on behalf of the NCAA Billy Taylor is a leading ball carrier in this game now yes 79 yards the top ball carrier for Stanford has been Winesburg with 16 yard as advertised it's been Michigan's run and Stanford's past second down three Michigan on the Stanford ten now they have a firsttime and they run Shuttlesworth to the 4 yard line Larry Butler making the stop and they do it one more time Kurt I said they look like they're tiring they showed it again right there that they might be tiring they've been in the football game a long time it's tough to play defensive football when our team can run like Michigan and they're constantly pounding it this has been a 14play drive for Michigan the started under 29 they have a first and goal to go they've been an excellent fourthquarter team this year really Taylor for a while coming through the hitting there Jeff seaman the allamerican linebacker number 92 let's watch Jeff seaman moving to the ball keeping his eye always on the quarterback watching for the pitch get inside outside position good tackle second down six To Go for a Michigan touchdown in the Stanford fix the game drive three to three beginning of the fourth quarter way please dowdy no wonder his coach Schembechler falls in the fish allaround athlete on the team he made some big plays today puts the ball under Stanford one makes a third in the yard to go here it is again quick pass glen dowdy a fine catch he was a leading receiver this year for Michigan with only 14 catches for a third down a yard to go now right after class sanfur didn't have the ball much in the second query they've had it only 359 in the third quarter coverage of the national NCAA basketball championship begins with a semi finals at night Thursday March 23rd the finals of Saturday March 25th from the LA sport's arena all exclusively on NBC 3rd down the yard to go for a Michigan touchdown here it is right from the ground we are now playing cornerback comes up papers done a fine job asking a little too much Kurt whoa line stands are awfully tough but very dramatic 17 plays for Michigan and that drive of 71 yards I'm Slade will hold Dana fine who hasn't missed the point all year bitch number 55 he already holds the NCAA alltime record of 54 in a row coming into this game action will continue here at the Rose ball the score Michigan ten Stanford green when you order a 72 Dodge Dart swinger with a special package of features we'll offer you an

special package of features and will offer you an automatic transmission at no extra charge the doubledot automatic special from Dodge depend on it you rode West last summer a lot of good things out there basic you know simple really beautiful we eat simple Kellogg's cornflakes a good taste simple food one of the few things around somebody hasn't tried to change the really good thing seem to be that way unchanged for the better Kellogg's cornflakes good pure simple the best things usually are after this kickoff they just had the first touchdown of the game it's 10 to 3 Michigan drooling 17 plays 71 yard drive and another 17 play Drive earlier stop on the oneyard line of Stanford notice he kicked up from the far hash marks deep miles more and John wins Barry dick is not too deep Moore has it on his 20 and it's fun down on his 24 yard line game has been fairly free of friendlies justic made the tackle next the Orange Bowl Alabama Nebraska 7:45 Eastern Standard Time there's a big series church this defense needs some rest is now up the bunts in the offense to keep the ball for a little while he'll be putting it up top he's tough to stop he knows he can complete passes against Michigan great drop back plenty of time coming out of the backfield you down to the 35 yard line for a first down very effective circling Braun and Sanderson out of the backfield Randy Logan Michigan's right halfsack had to make the tackle son of 36 with Stanford Pines is a cool customer Kurt he doesn't really try to force it he's tried to force a couple of issues today but he's taking what the defense is giving him he's at 12 out of 23 this afternoon what could have 20 out of 30 last year Sanderson to the 39 yard line 38 yard line of Stanford bred grandpa Michigan's tackle brought him down Hey second down and eight in the free Michigan fourth period 12 minutes to go you're looking right over the heads of the Michigan fan Morris to the lab winds bearish to the ride out the lines burn this by the softball well the body Atticus wine berries already caught for let's see it again he fires it out their courage they were right official right on it let's watch here now very difficult with them the ball hits the ground and you saw it in slow motion now it's third down eight to go Stanford from there 38 yard line 11:54 to play in this Rose Bowl game we've been getting better connection here there goes very head Michigan safety man at the first sound Stanford a Michigan 44 this has been their best play Reggie Sanderson's to matter backfield go straight down there's a little delay lines very cuts over the middle underneath the zone big play five catches for the sophomore Winnsboro today Manford on the Michigan's 44 first down Michigan lady 10 to 3 by guessing number 14 Frank gussy the senior wolf fan are over in that Michigan secondary from Garfield Heights Ohio there's buns for 14 out of 26 he had 183 yards a passing yardage in this game now got that defense opened up trade wouldn't surprise me to see him keep it on the on the ground there opened up a little bit they'll probably tighten here but they have been playing a little open the run could go straight up second down a yard to go for Stanford on the Michigan 35 fake the brown big rush green the brown stop by number 90 Mike Keller on a brilliant defensive maneuver if Brown had escaped Keller he had ten yards of open field ahead of him Keller a senior Grand Rapids made five solo tackles today so they had enough for the first down and only need of the yard there it's kind of break something wide open Stanford on the Michigan 34 yard line first down Reggie ashvin comes in split end but fire that complaint Saturday the young wines berry again what a fair hand this get hat to Oklahoma how do you look for that Oklahoma Waco how about punch the way he's firing that ball Bruce Shelley at the do pretty good position Tom garden that with garden was in pretty good position but the path is right there an excellent catch punch now 16 out of 28 when his quick relief 195 yards wines Barry has six receptions in this game now for Franco first down Stanford their failings in debris on a few bad pass and punts was throwing today second down ten Stanford on the Michigan 23 I'm looking for wines berry on that inside move that plan that we described before going underneath but occasionally wines berry is oneonone against Bruce Elliott the last plate was in that situation it looks like he cooked the Elliott deep dish village replaced bars on the Left wines very on the right second down ten over there hello I'm sorry hi well they score 10 to 3 here Michigan leading 9 and a half minutes to play in the game Darden and Elliot were double team that time on wines berry are those two men there I wonder if he threw that ball high purposely out I don't know Kurt he's awfully clever and as I mentioned he's very cool he's constantly thinking and he's got just tremendous concentration he picked up 2255 yards total offense this year the leader in the Pacific Coast stopping her down they drop the yard Par girl Brown circling out of the backfield a big rush again he retained his composure let's lead putting the pressure on him in the 37 boots it out he's doing all the right things Arisa flips very well he was flipping him just dumps it off to brown who picks up the first down at the 13 yard line of Michigan Stanford with a brilliant Drive of its own a different type of Drive not a grinding drive drive exploiting everything I shouldn't cover right the snake hit him and he recovered paid for itself at the Rose Bowl the score Michigan's n Sampath three when the job is tough and the roads are a man needs a tire that can take it here's a tough goodyear tire with two fiberglass belts big on my lats wherever you drive a wide flat fred that's big on traction to hang on through the curves a polyester court body that's big on strength to soak up the shocks a Goodyear custom white bread Polly glass tire they got traction they gone strength a big on mileage they are valuable and if it doesn't say Goodyear it can't be Polly glass 63 our driver Sanford foot on and the weather Michigan passed him up with the ball late doing fullback ed Shuttlesworth been fun since passing and Slade has been brilliant running a ball today he's gained 47 yards in eight carries nearly six yards of carry from his quarterback position three times is made three very important third down gains by running the ball himself carry we haven't been saying much about that offensive line of McKenzie Murdoch Coyle kudiye have been doing an excellent job in the free a45 ago by Sampson number 91 Sampson and Merlot also he is hurt he's up very slowly it's a situation Kurt where Doughty has been the big man doubt he's been making the big play number 22 he caught a five pass right down the goal line that led to the touchdown close I'm out late is injured it's call a timeout it seems to be his left leg and action will continue here at the Rose wall to give Slade a big hand the score Michigan 10 Stanford free there are many theories while attract to the new to bladed razor from Gillette gives you such a close shave let me tell you about one of them we know that when the first blade cut your whisker it can also lift it out a little from below the skin exposing extra whisker now if the theory is right before that whisker snaps back second blade comes along and can shave that extra whisker the new Gillette track two twin blade shaving system we think it's one blade better you know what makes shaving such a pain going over and over against the grain can irritate so Gillette introduces face saver it softens like a foam protects like a gel new face saver actually is lubricating protection so you can even save against the grain with less irritation new face saver softens like a foam protects like a gel 34 times waves all right face in the game the sooner he does on third and six those are running past and it's incomplete the full rather Jim Beckford coached under Woody Hayes at Ohio State when Paul Warfield was there and he compares rather similar the Warfield Jeff seaman puts a good rush here Kurt he was very instrumental this play not working pretty good crop a little high my mission will have a punt formation coming up Ferguson and Eric cross our back for Sanford Michigan's convert of only 5 out of 19 third down play today Barry got sours and punt formation over eight minutes to play blows file frost exit on he's 30 Johnny's made thick plays receiving running tackling today a very versatile valuable player for the University of Michigan safranbolu sound under 33 fallacy Michigan has had 204 yards rushing and just 26 passing almost the opposite the other way Stanford 195 yards passing 58 yards rushing Pro Bowl game will be on NBC Sunday January 23rd 4 o'clock Eastern Standard Time first time for Stanford under 33 they're trailing 10 the 3 I just had a long drive stop with a fumble Don plum behind 90 my color the end who drop back to defend against the past and if he ever had a chance to intercept the fast in his career three years right in his hands that with this carpenter hip fun as he lets the ball go the other end carpenter rush while the opposite in Keller drop back there's your time 804 to go in the 58th Rose Bowl game perfect weather here and Michigan ahead ten to three three of the last four years the Big Ten is lost to the Pacific game the King dominated this inner time from Surrey nearly fortunately starting to catch up once running out of the car is wrapped at the 33yard line we get there by the tackle Fred Rambo number 92 the junior peril I'll tell you there very few things they could take my eyes off of an exciting football game but I don't believe I have ever been in a setting quite as beautiful as this right here looking up at those mountains the Sun setting behind us got to tell you it's almost as good as third down and ten the alltime record here is a bit 10 18 wins the Pacific eight nine wins look at this setting third down and ten Stanford trailing tend to free that pass in complete to the tight end stop it wouldn't have been an easy catch but he knew it he had his hands on it I could have held on to it Bruce Elliott riding along with him and Stanford now must give up the ball they have a flag down Steve Murray coming and that's offside against Stanford being declined by Michigan State Murray and Confirmation Bruce Allen and Tom Darden back Darden has some trouble handling Plus today he's usually a very sure ball handler and punt return man for Michigan one of the reasons they made allamerica averaging 10 yards of fun it's a fake John Barrymore accident a thick first down Wilson said he could he'd do something in the game to shake it up there Jackie Brown sneaking out Gudrun this man scored two touchdowns in the last Rose Bowl game and he just makes a brilliant play magnificent Stanford on Michigan's 36 that has a crowd of a hundred and three thousand buzzing on first down stanford epic gamble by stanford back in their own territory but still seven minutes ago in a pass incomplete venoth the Winesburg they're doubleteaming him and triple teaming me now Bruce Elliott brought it up every time the sophomore goes down is clot six passes today he is now is being doubleteamed right now we should look for it that inside play once they go do it on this town one that we takes the back out of the backfield sent in deep delays with wines berry then cuts wines very over the middle it's been a big play it's worked every time second down ten Keller the end has been brought up great the next year back has done in for pass defending purposes Tom Drake for Michigan second down a hard way dumps it Lulu trying to get it off so he's tied him Scott but boy were they in on in that time three men nailed him just as he let the ball go Rambo Allison Beckman the middle of the Michigan line with Schembechler al said before the game the only way you can really go against bunches to rush him hard but he is poised enough that sometimes he beats the pass right and you don't carry with that rush and it really is coming in with the drop of the linebackers although we haven't seen the screen used it looks like it should work ten for Stanford on the Michigan 36 nicely gonna have seven three like gussick cackling once we sign in three times in a row and Kurt that's the way we've seen him all year the way you're beating the zone you beat it with the short passes you beat it with the back out of the backfield and this has been really a great year for the tight ends they've been having cheaper years Keller comes back in Tom Drake op snapper fall on the Michigan 24 that first start of this Drive on their 33 last two times it has possession they put on brilliant Drive breathe this one stopped then a fumble bunch sidelines nobody there instantly second down ten he's really he's really been been punished this defensive mind has been coming they've been coming all day Kurt why she can get hit there boy I'll tell you you earn your keep when you play quarterback that was carpenter and Alison on him tomorrow we'll be in Miami Miami Dolphins in Baltimore Colts for the American Football Conference championship 4:30 Eastern Time on NBC down Tim thanks for filling in 3 on the Michigan 24 6 and a half he carries a beautiful trash bag got them thinking finished they go run now watch the trap here Jackie Brown I guess he's motivated when he plays in the Rose Bowl who would think they go 37 yards out of the mix variety of plays they're going to Garcia chicken holding will be Steve marine that flies that kick is up the kick in there was a tie game roll they're all for the score I believe Labor's Michigan and therefore ten so much to be tried Dodge's always built tough trucks right well now they went to build a whole new pickup it it's soft flat gave it a smoother ride more room inside the pickup used to be a man's truck looks like the sausage will go for this of course I kind of go for the soft ace who gives you toughness it's just your style depend on it a plane will be talked about for years to come in the Rose Bowl Stanford's ball on their own thirty six fourth down they faked the punt snap to the short man Brown ran 40 yards to keep the drive going for Stanford and Brown had just won 24 for a touchdown Lindau he has the ball now he brings it out to his 32 yard line and now Michigan in possession he was hit by number 42 and number 16 rob net for Stanford and number 60 is Dan Tomlinson all right let's see what Michigan does now as their premed student they're fine sophomore quarterback Tom Slade comes in Stanford has just driven 67 yards to tie it up Michigan's ball under 32 yard line with the first down out of the wishbone to Glen Doughty dowdy trynna fertile he gets to the 35 a Michigan Rob nut coming up the taking high and Oh was Simoni there's your time the game type then the ten were approaching six minutes to go Terry John Ralston said he needs to score on some kind of a break he also said he would shake them up and he shaken us up with the break called beautifully played football game they said we had a score at least seventeen to win haven't done that yet there goes whether he was in the open running the crossing post pattern he was there and the pass just out of he Greek he had split between penny Barnes and Charley McLeod Oh rather who has outstanding speed a junior from Sandusky Ohio the average 16 and a half yards again Ritter Ralston they one thing he's done quite a job two years ago in a row in his Rose Bowl bringing a tenor claw point underdog team in here and being powerful how state last year and so far playing powerful Michigan even played fast for the sidelines now Michigan has to give was a benefit outing for sounds I say I'll have to give up the ball do they because Stanford wooden I'll carry they're going to give up the football here they're not taking any chances they've got to get excellent defense 542 to go 1010 what a second half just great football on both side very dots arm punt formation Eric cross the single safety dangers but he's got a bad leg they're cats 27 yard line Stanford last two times they've had the ball and put on brilliant Drive beginning Sunday February 20th of burano Canada and eight additional Sundays the world championship tennis presented on NBC's fall five minutes 35 seconds to go in this Rose Bowl game with a score tied 10 to 10 Stanford has the ball on their 27 yard line it was greater for you for that blowing deep great move by garden number 35 the pass intended for Jackie Brown who was in the open and the allamerican safety Tom gardener with perfect timing flashed in front to tip it away and again carried that one way to the bid he wasn't really said his best success has been going beneath the zone we'll probably see him do it we'll probably see him work with Jackie Brown Jackie is hot go with the hot man bunch now 18 out of 38 317 yards second down 10 for Stanford don't stop the fighting and he has pulled out it was a fumble but at the whistle blowing at the 35 caylor's a mother they covered number 90 Mike Taylor hit him and Michigan has tremendous rate now they stand for 75 big one think when this is why you get those emblems on your helmet he's leading with them he makes a big play Keller came over makes a big play fight for the ball Mike Herron 9 they really put the finisher on all right Michigan's ball first down in the fabric 35 guys send it down 31 Billy Taylor carried give it with a bread and butter man so moany tackling the outside linebacker in the right second down six there's your time five minutes to go now Shuttlesworth in Cypress comes out Michigan's made over 200 yards rushing but they're way below their seasonal average per game on the ground for the fired up Stanford defense today buying their hearts I play this game miss by rottenness at the 30 her Polti Hotel game up we've said at the start of the game the key would be the tackles made by the Stanford secondary they had to come up and tackle they knew Stanford didn't have a dangerous passing game and the Stanford secondary has done that now the balls on the 30yard line of Stanford third down and five Randy potol just made that tackle Taylor's carried the ball 30 times the Rose Bowl records 34 by Ernie Nevers there it is out there Taylor Taylor hit at the 29 that white stuff carrot has not been working Michigan has been forcing it the second there as you call it has really been coming up the linebackers have been coming up here's Dana thorn if he comes into the foot here he goes 36 this will be one of the big kicks of his young life his longest field goal 42 yards against UCLA this year this will be a 46yard attempt by Dana coin Tom Slade is holding the tie game three and a half minutes to play it kick is up short furgus was going to run her out and he's in trouble look out tasty tasty my cuddlesworth you try to get back these at the fire Paul of safety and Michigan lead 12 to 10 will have the free kick Tim Ferguson carrot will long remember this one as settles word on him almost like that plant is far the wrong way run by Roy regal of California fall action will continue air the Rose Wallace or Michigan twelve Stanford ten as I'm there and all that stuff here nice warm dry booze yes it's wonderful standing up here and unbelievable it's shuttlesworth a offensive fullback has made only one tackle in this game a tackle that will be remembered for a long time in the Rose Bowl Ferguson cut that fall in the end zone and of course it will be wondered why he didn't down it for the touchback I guess he thought he had an open field he could get 20 or 30 yards you saw him get out to the 5 and flying circle back he was dropped in the end zone for a safety and now Stanford has the free kick and Michigan will get the ball but 3 minutes and 18 seconds to go as Stanford of stop Michigan time after time when accounted here in the second half bull rider on his 32 his 40 and has dropped in his 45 Stanford his fumble of all away four times today and was in a tie here a little over three minutes to go Michigan's ball now they have Stanford has three timeouts left Michigan to we have some plays in this second half they fourth down fake punt for 40 yards snap to the short back that set up Stanford's touchdown and now this safety on a long way run he knew where he was going but he this kind of pick up some blocking and get to that far sideline Shuttlesworth carried the ball with three minutes to play Michigan leading 12 to 10 Michigan on their 47 Jam backer has got one thing in mind the backs have one thing in mind that is pull the football no fumble not now second down eight the goal for Michigan stay tuned for the Orange

I'm sure no one is left and the excitement is dismounting constantly the flag is down the Stanford team is walking back it looks like let's take a long one against Stanford now they signal illegal procedure five yards faster the template in a road full game remember that while winning 63 Ron banner killin through 48 net game punch now is 41 here that was the game of which he was USC 142 37 now Allen does such a great job in that game was finished almost in the dark on NBC television the 40 food or more objective my own for backyard number 45 brought down by Darden and Elliott Stanford now the Michigan 42 second down for one minute to play we'll have to stop the clock here drivers hole if Anderson took that one olia tackling the clock stopped 251 record what this hairs are feeling like Jackie Brown we've got to the last time to do it again then take time out complete mother's dr. phlox the first sound of a car as a Michigan 17 and Michigan now just for a hanging on against the areola strokes by John function Stanford they're going short there's one of the Michigan zone and they're feeding it right now they're going to run it and they run up to the 14th they've got a good field goal kicker remember let the Spanish watch the clock I'm out Stanford Danny Ralph is all right cool we'll talk it over 22 seconds to go Michigan leading 12 at then Al Jarreau gotta carry the field goal kicker has been a little bit malign than those games that they lost especially against San Jose State to see a few extra points were missed he had as many attempted field goals 27 at the end extra point he can kick field goals and he can kick it at a distance what a great opportunity from Garcia but there's 22 seconds in his time to score at that sound of course ever started his drive on their 22 yard line a desperation last mass drive racing against the clock 28 yards uphill $37 field 65 yard drive and now reached the Michigan 14 yard line they have a second down and seven Michigan leading 12 to 10 with 22 seconds to play Stanford has one timeout long working in the middle that go to the 30yard line as you find 16 seconds to go the last time here comes the field goal Mexican descent will arrive Garcia la Morita a sophomore whose hip pork bean field goal this year he can get hotter he can be erratic you can see he's not very big he's only a hundred and fifty five five you kicked some soccer style right now he has a chance for an historic field goal if he makes it exactly makes it I'm sorry a couple of very important things number one that ball is never in play and sometimes the center is overlooked to be sure that Dennis Gino's number 58 how very important this snap really is 16 seconds to go great Rose Bowl football game 12 to 10 and the field goal has been so important this year especially the saw a guy on Christmas Day named you Fleming make history and now here is little Garcia the soccerstyle kicker this will be a 31yard field goal attempt the Steve Murray Holmen let's see what happen watch it it is up it is whoa here Garcia has dramatically put Stanford out in front with 12 seconds to go 13 to 12 you'll have to clear the field Stanford must kickoff he had that distance on that one out boy he sure did not only the distance they significant to the followthrough in that young man though concentration and great followthrough folks the second happiest man in the ballpark right now is Jim Ferguson who took a short field goal rented out round and then was tapped for a safety the gay fishing in the lead and listened to lived on pucks after a great performance by Plunkett last year one could just won the Rookie of the Year the American Football Conference and he's going to be one of the great ones in pro football it's 24 out of 44 but 290 yards there he is what Garcia now unless pension returns us when it does something with a cousin an immortal name in Stanford football history he he's also 5 9 and 155 pounds our producer today have been Lucas arrow our director is there a coil unit manager Bill Thomason our technical supervisor jerry ireland our associate director bob osburgh our technical director dean Schwartz our film technical director and Siebenthal production of sitri alice is the game dick is coming a rather an alice II will prepare six seconds to go six seconds ago and unless a miracle happened two years in a row a heavily underdog Stanford team is going to come in with two of the biggest upsets of all time in a row for the team that seems to play its best in the pit game mysteriously losing games are supposed to win and then coming back to win the games you figure are going to be their toughest they call it the coach's nightmare a team a team that no one can figure out how they played today and how they played here last January food Larry sheep was the quarterback with six seconds to go he's going for the long bomb and it is going to be incomplete as upset Michigan Michigan had won 11 in a row in the 12 point favorites they had gone ahead on a safety with three and a half to go Stanford reached the clock reached the Michigan 13 rod Garcia food in the 31 yard field goal but 12 seconds

kicking he has a following wind about 15 miles NATO's earlier in the evening and we hope they have vanished in fact the weather bureau has said so perhaps some light rain only in the first quarter a kick is deep coming back into the end it's feminine and wisely puts the knee down and and Fighting Irish will first snap the ball here's the lineup Dave Casper's you see number 86 they tie down the split end at the bottom 85 peek dem early you see that you have nice and sylvester Denardo Brenneman chimeric oh those are the men up front and in the back field it's Clements number two best a Greek runner number 23 Panik with power and speed number 44 and powerful Wayne Bullock as a fullback number 30 so from the 20 it's Tom Clements who gets this ball game under way now asking for yes cheering so his teammates can hear the signals best when in motion some of those powerful wings bullet number 30 that's the animation that we showed you just a few moments ago pull back hitting in and that time he got the ball a linebackers we're thinking wide number 47 is woody Lowe the sophomore linebacker weather than rod showed of Oklahoma perhaps as the fastest that we've seen this year in this position he fought off the block of nice and made the tackle side of the field and the ball just across the 25 let's call it 426 it's a second down and four the officials changing balls the big snap because of the wet field the waters flashes his Gibbs and brings with him Ricky Davis number 19 one of the Alabama safety men defensively now for Alabama 83 Croyle rains number 91 low 47 we have 63 Montgomery 36 Strickland also up front number 72 Kabila's and DuBose number 54 well in the backfield it's Washington it's Davis but Macon along with Kane so it's the initial first down to the ball game at the 42 yard line first intent to the boundaries no score Plymouth's looks to be a very good call very beautifully for Alabama was number 34 Mike Washington really believed it was a broken play Chris the backfield came to the bottom of the screen and he went to the top and it didn't look like he had anybody leading him as you normally get when the quarterback is trying to run some kind of a bootleg Alabama has been playing a 5 to front bus fire but if Notre Dame continues to grind it out we're going to see if some varied alignments and planets can wash he's averaging four yards on each of his crazy 360 yards on the ground scoring touchdowns second to 9 now brings it out to the 48 for about 5 yards number 43 Tyrone King a sophomore from docena Alabama was in on the play ball control of course is the name of the game for the Irish they used it masterfully against the University of Southern California but Pat Brian thinks that if he can contain the Irish as they did on the first down of each series as they did on this says he can stop it's third down and four now let's question motion stop finish to the far side Bullock gets the first down and more Wayne as ministers and this'll guide of the 40th annual Sugar Bowl Classic of New Orleans and thus far Alabama's defense you can see is concentrated very strongly on stopping the off tackle play on the sweeps they're giving the fullback Bullock room to run those linebackers are thinking very strongly getting the outside that's their statistical record and it's magnificent and now Notre Dame is an enemy territory at the Alabama 43 Bullock with three carries 33 yards first down Tom Clements number two of Notre Dame the photo like press number 23 that was test number 23 getting a block from Gary DiNardo the right tackle who was moving out to the far side of the field is Wayne Hall the linebacker number 50 came into play Stars and helmets are for exceptional play who laid in his way above and beyond which of anomaly expectant with the fall player it's a Medal of Honor Award and some of those stars are falling right on Alabama miles Notre Dame is moved from Psalm 22 the 40 Alabama second down and 7 for a change was stopped the defensive work done by Cabela's number 72 of a Alabama front for Notre Dame is truly a multiple offense as you can see they rarely line up in the same formation twice but when they picked the man up in motion they snapped the ball when he's in his normal half back spot so they really are the equivalent of a Wing T all the time but they may go without anybody in motion and then there a double wing in eight plays no passes everything on the ground for Notre Dame 47 from about the Alabama 40 Clements still no pass and bring up up close down the dried wood started at the Notre Dame 20 on third down of seven stalled at the 38 bringing up a fourth down and a field position which is always a critical factor the Irish started from their own 20 they moved it down now to the 38 yard line but when you start on way back something usually happens before they get to pay dirt both teams have great kicking games for Notre Dame the punter is Brian Doherty the average is 40 to 70 but in this case they won't matter Alabama has two corners along in a short expecting some kind of a fake punt because they've got no one back deep all right the punt and it takes a lateral bounce at about the 15 of Alabama so the Crimson Tide averaging 41 points and mighty on the ground get the snap the ball following a 22 yard punt no score in the ball game with 10 minutes 46 seconds remaining in the first quarter wheeler 82 to 78 Sprayberry roof a chrome 165 George view is the tight end for Alabama number 88 and then the backfield the quarterback there you seeing the FIR Levin on his knee and his Rutledge number 80 Wilber Jackson then we have Ellis Beck member 35 number 26 jr. Randy Billingsley a very fine blocker so from the sixteen first intent Wilbur Jackson of Ozark a senior carried on the play Ross browner a freshman number 89 pinned him down are you seeing a Notre Dame fan for half time in the Sugar Bowl of classic loafer Jackson number 18 once a receivers census averaged an incredible seven point nine pick married during a season Wayne wheeler number 82 on the one pass catcher for Alabama set to the far side on second and nine from their own 17 analyst phone Taylor going out down the middle of pastor wheeler double coverage it's an incompletion there was not control or possession establish what a pass call of Alabama's passing comes up the play fake this is Wiener who is there split in he's averaged twenty seven point nine per reception and this was just a straight Street pattern down the field hoping that the defense would be torn in or brought in by the running fake and you can see that they had double coverage on him and ignored the fake Rudnik and Townsend where the two men that covered there you see what wheeler is done averaging twenty seven point nine per reception great year three touchdowns now it's third down a nine whew this tight end is split to the far side with Jackson in the slot the variations but then pull the Notre Dame defense Jerry cook tempeh number 40 Rutledge the quarterback so it spoke down Alabama both teams have had unusually long time to prepare for this game during the regular season you've got about three and a half days to get ready here you've got about four and a half weeks you can make a lot of changes in your defensive pattern and teach it and the first two or three possessions by both teams will give the coaches in the press box a chance to study what knew was being used tonight the wind is changing to the opposite direction gentlemen in the Crescent City Greg Dan of Alabama sixth in the nation in punting gets it off so not as it for Notre Dame at supporting Duncan that was a 48yard agree yard return bison on top Notre Dame as we look at the Fighting Irish band so the second time with 951 remaining in the first quarter Notre Dame will try to move the ball s ladies and gentlemen our young ladies that attended Notre Dame and same areas in South Bend Indiana and now Notre Dame the second opportunity to try to move it first attempt the 40 following an Alabama hunt with 908 remaining in the first quarter Artfest number 23 uses his blockers and brings it up about four yards where Greg Montgomery number 63 and 91 Mike Raines number 91 has been the kid who were in on the tackle there's best hard best first time he ever carried be the Irish bud remember against Fitchburg 56 yards touchdown a couple of weeks later against Texas Christian 57 yards touchdown a free spirited kid sometimes needs discipline but he is some run all right Pennock set away and he has the ball here Pennock number 44 he's a native of Ohio Chuck Strickland from Chattanooga Tennessee number 36 was in on the play there's clinic number 44 coming back to the Notre Dame huddle scored seven touchdowns this day this year rather has a two and a three of the year first down is the key play for both of these teams their fourth running team ball possession teams they really must pick up four or five yards on first down to have the proper balance in their attack the white jerseys no score Pennock the short of the first down as david McMakin of Tucker Georgia number 18 was right there so it's going to be a fourth down and about a yard Howard David McMakin of course is the younger brother of John McMakin the tight end of the Pittsburgh Steelers as a matter of fact the brother went to Clemson and everybody thought that David would go to Clemson to but Frank now at the former Philips equation says that young David got some of those Bama states Bear Bryant in manhours enough he went to Bama Robin Carey is deep for Alabama this is the second Notre Dame hunt by Brian Doherty number nine and the wind has changed here bud and Kerry is the boy that broke off from the Tennessee game when which side 21 to 21 in the fourth quarter with a scintillating punt return now it appears to be a following win for Notre Dame but it swirls around it's great it shifts quite a bit and we hope with it we'll go the weather Bobby now we'll get the snap from Joe Alvarado gets it off nonetheless Robin Carey calling for a fair catch and you saw what the wind did to that ball it came down like a knuckler because of the shifting winds at the 17 and that's exactly the spot where Alabama tried to move it on their first opportunity will be back Rebekah gonna Tulane Stadium in New Orleans Louisiana America's greatest New Year's Eve party featuring the battle for the national championship Alabama getting the ball for the second time no score first and ten at 17 Gary Rutledge covering on the play was number 14 tenacious Reggie Barnett Flint Michigan under his but a defensive player but mentioned earlier that Notre Dame would likely show a number of different fronts and that's exactly what they miss Alabama is doing the same thing in other words air has not got his boys to school to defense the wishbone the way he did against Texas when they beat Texas and broke a 30 game Longhorn winning streak a couple of years ago Wayne wheeler to the far side on second and 12 they lost two on the fly the step point of 15 Ellis Peck carrying for the first time number 35 the fullback and he's greeted by number 50 Greg Collins at number 88 Mike Fanning let's take a look at Greg Collins next year's captain he's number 50 normally a linebacker that time lined up on the line of scrimmage moving very rapidly from the outside position to make the tackle on the counter play the Notre Dame defense is going very quickly with the quarterback will see more counters here for a little while Gary let the Alabama quarterback we have six minutes 30 seconds remaining in the first quarter there's no score each team with two opportunity Ellis back and that Notre Dame defense which this year has allowed average of 82 yards per game on the ground number three in rushing defense remember Lula sign says I'm behind the Irish get aware of the company all around the country as an under Year's Eve and here's the second pump Alabama's Greg and now it's a fourth down fourth and seven fair catch call for by Bob's and not handle less difficulty in fielding him and did Robin Carey for Alabama a few moments ago so it's back and forth in the kicking game thus far has been very very important this one went 44 yards this kick was very close to being blocked as you can see the rush coming here from Notre Dame but we slapped the ball must go through was open number 88 who is banning the defensive tackle almost got to it but they did keep the lane open gained a little bit on the exchange of punts about five yards now from the 36 it's our first time and Clement shows a beautiful pass which was caught went for the interception it appeared that he had attempted to emulate the great catcher or Notre Dame from New Canaan Connecticut helps on the 19 yard gain combining with Clemens misses Notre Dame is the famous pick past pattern the quarterback is rolling to the bottom of the screen goes without looked like it might be intercepted by Davis but the ball was an untargeted instead of an interception its first down Irish all right now from the Alabama 45 right near the ball for nobody on the clinic first on and Bullock carries for about two yards Howard getting back to number 85 the split in peeked Emily I watched him for three years at New Canaan under a brilliant high school coach Coughlin and New Canaan was of course a powerhouse Connecticut high school there was used to kid Pete they said he wasn't fast enough for the position like they used to say about a kid named Howie twilly but he's always open and he has the hand multiplex from the second down it is second down that approximately eight yards as Clements now back to throw again down in the middle and in the same man giveaway 13 passes by Clements here's the prusik this is this area the Notre Dame defense the crossing pattern the quarterback rolling out as you can see here after he is fake to the fullback from the bottom of the screen the end will come across and he will be open on one of the slots that is slicing there this time he was open on the third slot right there and that's the theory of the Notre Dame crossing pattern that you can't cover him all the way across the field someplace he'll get over now at the 17 after a 26yard gain Artfest goes in motion first down Notre Dame tripping their deepest penetration there's another pass wide open was guess who generally he is having a ball he thinks he's back at New Canaan high school one of the things he had to learn at Notre Dame one of the things he had to learn was they's only part of a team now let's watch him in isolation that goes dentally again but this pattern crossing here has been a couple minutes the action that you get from the quarterback who was rolling to the right of the screen that freezes it you're not sure Clemens not going to run with the ball the linebackers have all got to pursue and is that the graphic showed you a few moments ago there are too many slots there to keep covered so a drive that started at their own 36 has now camped first and goal three Bullock trying to get in Bullock denied by the tough Alabama defense david McMakin one of them the strong safety coming up fast joining John Cole but he forced my cottage he did get and that's the secret to Pollock as Debbie Jordi was safe to cut me earlier today said roll it constantly amazes me he seen slower you think he's going nowhere and when he's done he's got four or five yards dumpy Dorothy will be on Coach's Corner at half time you've been up a late the thing that sets up that pass and we didn't mention is when the quarterback gets outside of the leverage man another defect left I forgot a key contriving up inside now it's second down and goal with the ball and again the Alabama defense was right there Tom Clements carrying on the play little foam along these chains Chris he wanted to hand it off the fennec coming around but he bobbled the ball and like any great athlete had the reflex to bring it back in control it and then try to get a little yardage himself Clements is a great athlete because he had a beat out of great athlete it was ahead of him to get the job a youngster named cliff Brown have a Middletown Pennsylvania who once won against Jimmy Jones of Harrisburg Pennsylvania became the USC quaterback now it's third down and goal for Notre Dame going against Alabama there's no score touchdown Tulane Stadium including members of the Irish guard all the eyelid fitment as watch it again this is just the raw power of motor Penix coming in motion the handoff to Bullock and look at that line take off together low hard just moving Alabama back into the end zone for like powers at overs on their third possession they store Oh a bad snap 205 Thomas was getting set to pick up majority the corner who holds for Thomas it was a high pass tomorrow Alabama getting ready to receive following a Notre Dame touchdown and a drive to with 64 yards in six plays three consecutive passes aiding 19 yards 27 yards and 13 yards for a team that passes sparingly Notre Dame and of course automotive Emily and the extra point was missed because the snap was high here's the kick following a Notre Dame six corner Alabama now has the ball family at about the 27 yard line for side Wells number 31 note home very interesting statistic for great offensive team Alabama averaging six point nine yards clear play coming into this game held to only one yard and they've had two possessions just their third yes but it's very very early and the thing to remember about Alabama is they're the most explosive team in the nation in the fourth quarter 21 points against Tennessee for instance two touchdowns in the waning moments against Georgia trailed Kentucky and came back against them Paul Spivey number 24 has replaced effect in the wishbone at fullback from the 27 first down Gabon has ever using 66 players a game so now for the first time he's beginning to move in some of the reserve backs who are extremely good as Luther Bradley made the stop at about the line Notre Dame as far as lining up in a normal defense but they're bringing either Townsend or Bradley with the snap of the ball to fill the slot against the quarterback it's a very hard man to pick up from the offensive blocking standpoint for we'll try to adjust to it now it's second down to Tim for Alabama Notre Dame lead six to nothing coming up to the 3minute mark first quarter second and 10 for the tide red lead that was a short tackle he wasn't going to break from that grass and Mike Townsend the senior from Hamilton Ohio after the tackle you probably saw a gallery slide a little bit as Chris mentioned at the top of the show we had a couple of downpours before the game very heavy torrential rains and deep and they don't have a squeegee here we can't understand as quickly as possible drain off and dry out the field but still even under the circumstances the field looks most flammable Hawley Tariff artificial surface third down and five now here at the Sugar Bowl Notre Dame leading six to nothing Alabama with the ball runner 89 the freshman from Warren Ohio take a look at him 63 218 and we have an isolation of that great firstyear man here he is the freshman as Chris mentioned big strong he was trying to be blocked here by number 65 brown but he was so quick and so fast that he got around him and then was able to turn in and pressure Rutledge before he could get rid of the ball Alabama will punt for the third time Tim Rudnick is deep along with 7:34 dance party had to get it up in a hurry comes off the side of his foot it didn't go straight forward as he wished Ross groaning number 89 who we were speaking put the rush on the punter that was probably Ganz chorus punt of the year and it sets the Irish up in beautiful field position again the Saturday on ABC's Wide World of Sports eats east/west and the hula bowl vaya live satellite from Honolulu Hawaii featuring top college football players from around the country including Heisman Trophy winner John cappelletti from Penn State Oakland Trophy winner John Hicks of Ohio State don't miss the exciting football confrontation on ABC's Wide World of Courtney an Eastern Time so the ball was set from the 49 of Alabama Notre Dame leading six to nothing give the handoff to Wayne Bullock of Newport News Virginia wind Rolo and kapila's number 72 defensively for the tide with a minute and 12 seconds remaining in the first quarter to just join us Notre Dame in a previous drive went 64 yards in five plays Pennock scarring Bullock rather and the extra point was missed because of a high snap from center ball the cookie to hit it so it's second down and eight aren't best you may list again number 72 he's the senior right defensive tackle lined up with Mike DuBose number 54 of op Alabama but you've seen Notre Dame a couple of times this year have they reduced the amount of place in which Penix been in motion and pay for a best because odd seems to be in motion more often I don't think they will as the game goes along is where they are hash mark wise and which man is going to be in motion usually it comes to the wide field as you can see the clock running out on the first quarter similar to the far side pemmican motion on his third and seven very important series there under the Crimson Tide Notre Dame that excellent field position if they could have moved it down they could have put the game and reasonable control senior Chuck Strickland number 36 was right there to make the stop at the 46 fourth down and seven will have the punt in a moment and here is the Notre Dame punt the first play of the second quarter as time it is expired Robin Carey takes the guard a punt so now it'll be Alabama that has yet to do anything let's impress anyone Steve Sylvester number 71 made the tackle following a 27yard punt and look at those 0 goose egg statistic and that's the second most prolific offensive team in the country rushing the football Notre Dame de lis dominating time of possession the Alabama defense has held him to seven points but the ability of the Irish to keep the ball 21 plays to nine is something we'll have to change for Alabama recession time over ten minutes for the Fighting Irish little more than four for Alabama who now has the ball at its home 20 a pass and and there is a first down or how does it move completion we're going to have to put the ball in the air bud and I think we should emphasize that in the Alabama scheme of things pillows listed as tight and isn't really a Titan no actually they both he and wheeler have the same physical capabilities q is 199 pounder who actually is more of a split ender wide receiver than here's a Titan and he's caught only eight passes however as compared to nine year for wheeler Alabama now keeping that on the ground is called spy date number 24 the number two Kovac brings it out to about the 45 and is that another Alabama first down let's see I didn't believe christen is possible to keep Alabama from making a first down in a 15 minutes of football but in that first quarter make a single first down let's watch that play again runner at the top of your screen is the right end this is a counter play runner gets a little bit too deep he was thinking pass and he did not see him coming back and you've got to be in a little sharper angle to prevent that from happening now wheeler to the near side on a 1st and 10 from their own 44 Alabama Charlie six to nothing over Jackson the number 1 Russia number 80 stopped right in his tracks at the line by fluke temple 40 Greg Collins number 50 a moment ago you heard from and saw Meadowlark lemon at the Globetrotters also on our initial on our premiere Sunday Wide World of Sports at 3:30 Eastern and 2:30 central and for Pacific from Oahu Hawaii will be tough surfers competing in the Hawaiian masters surfing championship this coming Sunday we'll tell you more about a great week of sports on ABC the greatest of college football games right here tonight and Louisiana after one pair to play Notre Dame leads a score of six to nothing as they went 64 yards in six plays at three minutes and 19 seconds remaining in the first quarter where in the first minute and a half of the second quarter let's take this pause Notre Dame cheerleaders and there are the first to cheer here in the first quarter after about 12 minutes Notre Dame's score they missed the extra point on a bad snap they lead six to nothing but right now with 1332 to go in the second quarter Alabama has a second and nine on their own 44 wide is number 26 Randy Billingsley penetrates motivate territory for the first time 16 yards first down now you sing the real Alabama team his blood pointed out there only if they've got backs coming out of here's five eight who was behind Beck Beck is a senior and he always laughingly says well the coach starts me because I'm slow and not really the best when he wants to give me a shot and get me out quickly so the real players can get in all right now with the ball at the 39 of Notre Dame to the far side number 82 at the top of your screen that's Wayne wheeler Jackson Spivey ongoings de behind the quarterback watch legs first down and carrying Paul's five a number 20 for 13 minutes 16 seconds remaining in the first half Notre Dame lates Alabama six to nothing your name varying the defense from six men in the line of scrimmage with a middle linebacker to a 52 front but they're bringing the safety to the side the quarterback starts if he starts right it's Townsend coming if he starts left it's Bradley coming Alabama is doing a much better job of picking up the various stumps of the Notre Dame team on this Drive wheeler again at the top of your screen on second and seven that's Billingsley Billingsley inside the Notre Dame 30 then out of bounds forced out by number 50 Greg Collins making a nice block was chrome on the pre display a good play John Rogers the strong guard blocked beautifully for the runner and I believe that the motor game has been that wide field conscious thus far on this drive Alabama is coming to the narrow part of the field which is to the bottom of your screen that change the pace of the power sweep is excellent against the defense that is normally looking at an option that's Paul Bear Bryant 60 years old Alabama hundred and forty victories overall as a head coach 231 behind the lake in alonzo stagg and Pop Warner first and 10 now from the 29 Rutledge to Jackson and sliding find the fetter blocking back in college football and ran at the perfect size 510 190 which means that he's below and is in the hitting position when he's ready Jackson carried the ball only 95 times in the entire season for Alabama which to me is very interesting when you think the cappelletti carries it about 28 times per game all right seven plays five first downs in this drive that began at the Alabama 20 they have now reached the Notre Dame 17 with another first down let me look at that ball this way Jim stock over the ball for the Fighting Irish grounder is there as well number 89 there he is number 48 from Barberton Ohio sophomore Jim stock so the first turnover when you're going down the line of scrimmage with your quarterback everybody's firing out and the backs are all penetrating and you fumble the ball there's just no way you're normally going to get the ball recovered because the whole defense is closing on the ball and all your people are running away from it drive that begin at the 20 now misfires it'll be the Fighting Irish leading six to nothing that have it first and 10 at their own 36 what a minute 25 seconds to go 10 of crota coalition Clemens Dave Casper the big tight end look at him ramble a marker is down from his own 36 down to about the 46 we may have a cut call coming up you called it just right Chris the wide receiver I know for certain who it was I think it was pending for him three coming back down field it was a gain of 18 Steve Sylvester put a superb block on to open the hole for caspo that sprung him loose very well timed as you pointed out hard the corner man had come trying to get into the play so from the spot of the infraction the ball comes back to the 39 not a reminder that the rookies will return one week from today at its usual time right here on ABC I'll tell ya it's a different kind of Monday Night Football for me this college game is Swift so many more plays so here we go we're playing the first down spot as the 39 Notre Dame leading 6 to nothing panic Woodrow loan number 47 running a three fine Alabama linebackers joined by Mike DuBose on the tackle at approximately the 43 gain of four and I'm very surprised at how sure the pudding has been thus far as we've mentioned we had heavy showers the field is drained well and neither team seems to be having any fella getting traction second down and about three that was Paul Bear Bryant the coach at Alabama fest in motion Clements putting it right in the midsection of Wayne Bullock who scored the other day and touchdown in the first quarter very close but a little short this okay third down you see the makkya markers on the far side of the field Turpin Dick Turpin number 66 the sophomore made the tackle conversions Notre Dame 205 on third down Alabama Cyril that's a misleading statistic that third down conversions don't you agree bud we can develop it later yes so if you make the first down and second down you don't get fettered according to those stats and now from about the 46 its third down Washington Alabama has gotten the ball on the exchange in favorable field position ten minutes ten seconds remaining in the first half Notre Dame leading the tie six to nothing back again at the Sugar Bowl New Orleans Louisiana on New Year's Eve a carnival atmosphere out here the weather has improved it is not raining now Johnny Sharples 16 is in the Alabama lineup they've just recovered an older dame fumble they have it at their own 48 first down of Notre Dame leading 1610 tend to go first half Spivey carrying on the play a couple of yards you're looking at the count down in the second quarter right now and bud one lucky things if not the key thing that gives college football an extra dimension is the running quarterback oddly we haven't seen Gary Rutledge spring loose tonight methought from that very play at the top of the game Tommy Clemons hasn't been carrying either well thus far Alabama has not had a chance to run their quarterback because of that safety man coming up to claim as I spoke about earlier all right three new backs five eight Shelby and stock same quarterback catch number 32 Mike stock of Elkhart Indiana which is just down the road from South Bend which is the home of course of the golden dome and Notre Dame and therein lies the story stocks dad is a very close friend to verify secant and in fact stocks dad flew some Notre Dame people down here to scout Alabama gets the land himself attends Alabama quite a flair South Lawn 510 179 and and that's what we mean Mike stock carrying for coach Paul Bear Bryant numberone ranked Alabama and they are meeting Notre Dame tonight as a national championship the McArthur bowl will be awarded to the winner of this game watch the puck the Alabama line you'll see how much better they're reading the Notre Dame stunts at this point in the game have 844 to go on the first half Rutledge handing off to a spinning pause fighting striving moves it forward to about the 23 and it's an Alabama first down as Drew mihalick number 45 made the stop it's one of the advantages of the options that you get from the wishbone is that the linebacker here number 50 Collins is thinking that Rutledge has got the ball by the time he notices that the ball has been given to the fullback he's a little bit offbalance on the 23 first down Rutledge on a keeper his guard was out there trying to help and he brings it to the 10 another Alabama first down there you go there's a quarterback running the ball and budget got exactly right now they can't bring Bradley in there and they can't spring Townsend in there the way they were because Rutledge is moving those defenses and now he's gonna be able to move the ball himself and the odd hat back moving downfield now to pick up that safety man but the quarterback gets him run to run we'll see Todd in the game he's a stronger runner at Rutland and only you see number 10 coming in on each play to bring the message that is he gets a lot of yardage that not officially in the game and there is Mike stuck on first down play making it right near the five cups second and about three browner on the tackle here comes rich way now into the Alabama huddle you look at the Notre Dame defensive fire light huddle the signals being called Greg Collins attempt in Olympia next year by the way Mike stock was a high school bottom a halfback pass now we have Wilbur Jackson back in the lineup along with Spivey and Randy Billingsley championship 52 yards seven Crimson Tide and now they can take the lead as Notre Dame failed on the snap to get it to the holder thus their six points bill Davis now one of three members of the Davis family who have kicked for Alabama over the years will try to put Alabama on time it's up it's and Alabama just as we expected grilling game for the national championship the first week with seven and a half minutes remaining in the first half Alabama has just gone 52 yards in seven plays Billingsley scoring and with the extra point they now lead Notre Dame 7 to 6 Gant will kick off to either feminine or al Hunter hunter at the 15 for Notre Dame at the 30 at the 3540 94 yards and another thing puts down and the Notre Dame team is coming onto the field that will be a little penalty like a better trick myself their button and the only excitement college football it is not a penalty by next year I think it will be Chris I agree with you the loyalty video thicket you're always been for him oh yes but that bunch beautiful block those are things that you just don't expect will happen to this great football team like Alabama parents kickoff return now will they go for two yes from Greenville North Carolina and there's intense era Parseghian with this year's the 1974 chairman of the National Multiple Sclerosis Hope Chest campaign he knows all about it three members of the NVIDIA family including his sister have been afflicted by MS era says they need my help and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society needs your help and there is got it he's an extraordinary man he really is studies of the disease you can say what you want and get you all the time wisely get things settle down before they try for two as al hunter is just going 94 yards with the kick following an Alabama touchdown wow what a game love it welcome to seven we hope you're enjoying it I hope this is really setting you up for an enjoyable 1974 this situation normally teams go was some sort of an inside fake with a quarterback rolling out to throw the ball and I recall very vividly playing against the University of Texas one time where we were thinking that was what was going to come and Darrell royal press this up to fight his run in the straight ahead fullback wedge over the middle and he almost ran through the end zone at 94 yard return broke monk Simon sugar bowl in 1935 of 90 yards bumping on the sugar ball committee and Notre Dame now goes for two they lead 12 to 7 here's the truck coming wide open in the end zone hundred with the ball now keep your eye on the left side of your screen don't watch the ball Jerry watch the left side of your screen look at those flops beautiful ball carrier and a man with exceptional speed that's one of the differences between this year's notre dame game the speed of their back 15 seconds we've just had 15 points scored right and this is the extra point attempt again the inside faked as we mentioned earlier with the quarterback dropping back to throw and watch rosemary almost has it but as Howard pointed out Clements hung it up there just high enough to score the two points as we expected they're playing like they're playing for the national championship two great teams undefeated untied Calvin Keller who can fly number 33 and she'll be 30 on the near side can move to Alabama awaiting cliff Browns kick there's Brown number one thing I'm sure of before this game is over Alabama I'll have more points on the board no question about it in Calvin Callahan Chris mentioned broke one the longest run this year for Alabama the kickoff Chris all right there it is coming down very slowly to Shelby Shelby at the three 510 moving out to the 15 now with blockers ahead he's up to the 30 and he's tripped up at about the 31 and 228 yard return as Parker of Notre Dame the defensive halfback was in on the play on kick coverage so now with 7 minutes and 19 seconds remaining in the first half Notre Dame has regained the lead that when the twopoint conversion lead 14 to 7 and that two points very very significant that they've been able to not make it at one point from the highest nap on the first touchdown looking forward to the fourth quarter could have been the most significant play of the game this Saturday don't miss the season premiere of the popular Professional Bowlers tour the $100,000 open from San Francisco to 38 1:30 central 5 Pacific Alabama now caring was colored in a first intent from the 30 showing you their depth that is the third string and he is a freshman at Kovac he is a great great young prospect one of the most soughtafter ones in the country and as I mentioned had the longest touchdown run this year for the tie let's take a look at Collins bud number 50 the great outside linebacker for Notre Dame just slipping the block moving in he didn't quite have his feet in front of the momentum of the ball carrier made the tackle as he fell forward on a second and 7 and the 32 Mike stock offended across the 35 came from the 33 as you see the puck running 626 now remaining in the first half did you just join this Notre Dame scored first when a 64 yard drive they missed the extra point Alabama came back and went 80 yards to scar correction went 52 yards to score they fumbled on their 80 yard attempt and Notre Dame recovered but they got the ball on a Notre Dame fumble to go 52 to get their 7 points and then on the ensuing kickoff al hunter when 94 yards could third down and five that's Willie Shelby Tim Rudnick staying right with him number seven from Chicago Illinois another senior and you see it brings up fourth down and a little more than two for Alabama that was the eighth Alabama flare to carry the ball you mentioned Tim Rodman he's a smallish one came in in effect as a free agent tried out for the team amazed everybody gutsy little guy down Greg gasps winning for Alabama Simon and Rudnick and it goes into the end zone touch back 62 yards so it'll come out to the 20 and Notre Dame with a 14 to 7 lead we have 5:15 remaining in the first half yeah there's a man that's coached a lot of quarterbacks like Joe the man with the Tyrolean houndstooth hat and Alabama did not make a single first down in the first quarter they've already made nine in this quarter Bear Bryant steam now in defenses Notre Dame has it following an Alabama pond at their own 20 first and 10 they lead 14 to 7 Pentagon motion Bullock the only set back and he carries the ball and very effectively about eight or nine yards Wayne Bullock who scored 10 touchdowns this year he scored the first Notre Dame touchdown tonight getting back to the bear 15 straight times he has brought Bama to a bowl game and yet he doesn't have a victory in his last six this he wants desperate he's got 5 losses in a time the last six says this is walking college game ever played from the people of the south all right Pentagon a second of to stop hmm hit hard first by wind Rolo then number 18 David McMakin and fares last victory in a bowl game was right here at the Sugar Bowl in 1967 right now let's watch woody low 47 you said earlier but outside of an Oklahoma linebacker perhaps the swift dish you've seen all alone in leading the Alabamians and tackle he's been involved in a hundred thirtyfour tackles this year 8600 system McMakin was hurt on that last play in tackling ellen visit ola a birmingham alabama takes his place number 432 beautiful defense fourth down and one and a half a very big play for the die we know did it Howard mentioned those statistics of low and this is partly because they shield him from anybody being able to get to him he saw him move outside on the stuntin very very quickly so no one could get to him quickly and he's incredibly strong in addition to that quickness two plays in a row that the tide stopped them after they had second down and only two to go his strength was the point there that's like a tackle garrison in the critical game between Dallas and Washington early in the pro football season there we look at Brian Doherty who picks effectively going to big returns on him when he punts number five is Duffy Bowles just looks at the ball that's one of those funds Chris make you shake your head when you're coaching because it was a low line drive it fell surprisingly short and then took the long roll 54 yards Alabama inside their own 20 at approximately the 18 and we've got Richard Todd coming in at quarterback Chris yes he's a very fine one he's quite a lot for Alabama he's from mobile he's their number two rusher with six hundred and four yards he's thrown four touchdowns and he's a sophomore and bearer does not hesitate to using we think she's one of the more gifted athletes he's ever coached area is number 14 getting his second pass of the night out at about the thirty thirteen yards first down lamp low five buds comment on Richard Todd who we have just seen throw for the first time and he went back the second throw as you saw the Big Bear says that he gets the ball away even more quickly his release is even swifter than Joe Willie Namath I would have to debate the bear about I will everybody can do it all right here's Todd first and ten from the 31 this is why he's the number two rusher got a little more that was sweep all the way but you saw Todd get the ball up to make those secondary people wonder might I not throw it let's watch Luther Bradley the great freshman defensive back the Notre Dame you can see how close he's playing to the line of scrimmage here wound up as a monster man he's just swinging to the outside because he thinks it still might be a pass at this point but was when Jackson makes a beautiful block on him and Todd moves it forward for the first down all right now from the 43 after that 12 yard gain Alabama's Billings leg up near the midfield stripe 233 left in the first half all right second down and three from midfield Todd pitching back to Jackson Jackson is the first on the board for Alabama Texan touchdown saving tackle by Drew Mihaly number 45 from Birmingham Michigan on Wilbur Jackson the Alabama number one Russia who rambled 24 yards alabama has only one timeout remaining and i was beginning to wonder whether that wasn't too much ground for a wishbone team to pick up if you want to give them six or seven yards of play it's very simple usually to stop them but that superb execution of the triple option though all right now Miller's foot to the near side at the home you screen Todd handing off to Jackson all the variety of the wishbone and carrying him outside was number 50 of Notre Dame Greg Collins the junior from Troy Michigan failed to get out of bounds though as he would have liked to to kill that clock yeah that's what they're fighting now Collins in tonight playing an outstanding he's been outstanding all season long big 63 220 pounds he's got physique you're looking for her linebacker second down they need four yards at the Notre Dame 23 with a minute 46 to go first half third down coming up as Wilbur Jackson carried to me that down Christic Notre Dame was teeing Jackson assuming that he would be given the ball because of the tremendous rushing that he's done all year averaging seven point nine yards per carry for the season Marcus running only one timeout left here in the first half for Alabama Ridgeway number 10 has just brought the play in rock tapes running 123 to go first half Notre Dame lady 147 sugar ball what the field is as drew mihalick again in on Wilbur Jackson who trying to get outside on the past I think it was stock that gave him a very good Russian the ball was thrown a little bit behind him it he hit him perfectly he could have picked up the first down all right Phil Davis who's picked a 214 field goals is coming in now he's from Pompano Beach the Davis family have kicked a total of four hundred and sixtysix points over the years for Alabama brothers Steve and Tim this is Bill his kick 33 yarder I get about 38 yards and Alabama and put three points on the board to blow and then floor of Notre Dame with 39 seconds remaining first half it is now championship the Sugar Bowl and all the marbles let's watch ticker Davis number one head down he looks very very carefully at the ball now he looks up after it's well on its way and now he sees it go through and he's signaling it's good baby three point the senior year no doubt Gary jiminy is deep along with Al hunter last time al fielded the ball he went 94 yards to score for Notre Dame I would think Chris that they distribute her outside of her something here with a little time is remaining he pulled it away that's very senior he brings it out to about the 31 I tell you they really open those hole those lanes with that weight but for a minute he looked like he could break the hardest playing football the timely kickoff return because you never know how deep the kick is going to be how long it's going to be in the air if anybody blocks more than about three or four yards ahead of the ball carrier the defensive man will get off that block get up and get back to the play Steve Ford made the tackle Notre Dame with two timeouts 31 seconds left on the clock first half as they lead 14 to 10 first day on a path alone 30 Cummins number 2 a solo and a couple of linemen out there brings in a respectful across the 45 for a Notre Dame first down Tyrone King on the tackle box top there's plenty of time for them to put three points on the board if they can pick up another 15 or 20 yards well this is the highlight game of our 1973 season the personal hula ball coming up this coming Saturday from Honolulu and also on Saturday and Sunday fabled Pebble Beach gentlemen it'll be another edition of penguins proam championship and we'll be there along the thing during commentary it's a great event with all of the top pros and then the amateurs Jack Lemmon Clint Eastwood and James Garner people that you like to see playing golf as they play a little more like you and I do Bing Crosby appreciated by the thirteenth year the premiere of the popular Professional Bowlers tour hauless on ABC now from the 46 it's a first down Notre Dame 22 seconds left first half Wonder under 25 is in the lineup down the middle intended for generally Ricky Davis came up let's watch generally going down a field on this play Davis for reading for playing centerfielder Emily number 85 is swinging on the post pattern he was open and then you saw Dave timon perfectly to knock the ball down first in completion by Clemens that bad 4:05 53% for the season let's watch Davis here here Justin he thought he might make the interception but Emily did a good job of putting his body but bringing him in the ball McMakin is back in defensively as Clements moves out of the pocket wasted on his own hit hard by Tyrone King on the far side of the peeled stop into Clark was seven seconds to go each team with a timeout people are always talking about size and strength in the part of Notre Dame which they certainly have cl\u00e9mence is what makes him the superior quarterback with seven seconds left he's got to throw the sideline hits it seems to me get him out of Bounce and yet close enough to attempt the field goal Bobby Thomas is a mine field goal kickers soccer star if they complete one down the field go hard they got a timeout left so they might go for wherever they think the open spot is Alabama 43 is the spot first in ten Motor named Clement goes Q goes demo Lane you call the perfectly that was dim early one second mark stop the flag on the play generally breaking on the pattern as you saw the swing man go feet and that's Woodrow low coming in and the official said he hit him before the ball got there that's a penalty however that will not hurt Alabama to any great degree one second remaining which means one more play unless we get another penalty called on Alabama however penalty lose the ball in new possible field goal range Bob Thomas number 98 who said on 9 of 18 as long as was 47 yards this is one of 48 yards on an angle in college football it's up it's no good so both undefeated in powerful teams representing the best of America's college teams University and colleague Notre Dame in Alabama go to the dressing room with a parting Irish leading Alabama by a score of 14 to 10 with a tremendous Sugar Bowl halftime about to begin let's take this break it cooked round the senior plumber starting quarterback to another day we'll kick from left to right the wind has calmed somewhat as we have Culliver 33 and Shelby 30 deep brown where you see number eight quick bro number 20 Gary Domanick giving the signal noted on his toe hits the ball it's up in the air and it's Calvin Culliver feeling it I think trouble holding it gets it up to two it comes out to the five tough break for Alabama from there they'll try to work it as a channel 14 to 10 they'll go with these men up front Spray barren ground the tackles Ruffin and Rogers the guards chrome Sylvester chrome is the center in the backfield is Rutledge Jackson Billingsley in fact first down is the key play for both of these teams because they like to run the ball Alabama's average on first time plays in the first quarter was zero they're average in the second quarter was 10 yards on each firsttime snap there's a referee Jean Calhoun a penalty being stepped off here a clipping penalty against Alabama half the distance to the goal line so that puts them even deeper in their own territory back in with a sanity of the hash mark they ate the backfield 80 Jackson 24 5 8 26 Billingsley first and 10 first stop of the second half lovely Rutledge coming out across the 15 for Alabama Townsend helping to bring him down it's a 10 yard move by the quarterback and a beautiful wreath and the part of Rutledge should we saw the closing on the fullback back kept the ball and is the corner man by net played deep he simply kept it and that's what they're looking for him first down at 8 yard game second down and a little less than three or attempt Sentai trailing 1410 wayne wheeler's set away stay on the ground and it's 5a that was trying to challenge the Notre Dame defense on the second down play Kevin nice Bush from Milwaukee number 60 underneath to make the stop were right at the line so it'll be third and about three from the 15th obvious statement of how important it is for Alabama to pick up three yards or more in this play given the area's great field position if they fail to make crimson jersey Rutledge projection and Jackson hours his way for the first down as Townsend forces him out of bounds Townsend number 27 and there is Jackson number 80 from Ozark Alabama senior gone eight touchdowns this year this was a power sweep being run by Alabama you can see Pugh throwing the first block on browner he got to him fairly well the browner fought off that plot and then he was pinned as Billingsley went in on the second block but he knocked down much of the interference as you could see that was Alabama's first full blown conversion of all day 10 at the 23 a big hole opened up for rent Randi Billingsley who scored the only Alabama touchdown second quarter and this time Greg Collins and Rudnick stopping following a 10 yard gain another first down and there's coach Paul Bear Bryant his 22nd full game his last victory of bowl game was 1967 here in the Sugar Bowl against Nebraska 34:6 he's not had a losing streak like that I don't do those career and he done Wonka on the 33 first down Alabama with the ball there is a variety of the wishbone accent the power in the inside belly play awesome totally average little over nine yards on their first down snaps but we've got some kind of a discussion and don't know who's gonna get penalized here but we'll know in a moment in the white cap Jean Calhoun the referee from Madison Wisconsin the umpire Harvey Hardy from Lakeland Florida lineman Jim Lange Hurst and we inviting higher ratio must have been piling on after the tackle and can't couldn't really see it myself there's so much at stake in this game it's for the national championship this was screener going downfield he now tries to make the block and you can see Rudnick taking that little swing at him there Twitter so great reflexes Howard you've seen a lot of boxing he got out of the way I told you earlier Ruud fixes smallish fellow who's the gutsy guy and let's let's take another look at it you got to be gutsy to do that to try to do that to wheel it cos wheel is a lot bigger we were trying to guess why are you officers don't hit man when he's down pretty good judgment and I hit that thanks guys ever HAP your fist now the snap will come from the Notre Dame 42 a very costly penalty Rutledge Willard going for his first catch and redneck knocks it away and nearly pulled it out of the what a battler having Rudnick number seven and Whaler who has yet to catch a pass tonight number 82 you saw the two men sort of having a little trials in the previous play and Rudnick is right with him here and Greeks very high for the ball almost made the interception a little more wide field I think he might have Rudnick isn't in his own way as an inspirational a lot of young people as I mentioned earlier he wasn't recruited by Notre Dame for football went there just dried out for the teeth second down and 10 now for Alabama trailing 1410 getting to the 40 is Paul Spivey of Montgomery number 24 senior flow back one of the things when you're coaching a running team like the wishbone that you worry about as a coach the best passing down his first down because you know they expect you to run it but if you get the incompletion you come in there second and 10 which relaxes the defense now buddy here's a third down and seven for Alabama at the name leading 1410 beautifully Lanson excellent I go by quick Alabama 18 first down challenge the outside linebacker across the field we took the step laterally to go for the first fake it was simply a cost over the 10 at the end and he came all the way across the field and ran down Jackson who's one of the fastest men with Alabama has great move by Collin that's one of those beautiful lead passes on the phone I've ever seen Weston 10 Jackson going up set browner chasing who Notre Dame comes up to make sure everything that you thought about the first day of fall practice is at stake here in the last 30 minutes every team in the country being here are here there's nothing to save the day undefeated untied had only one common opponent that was miami alabama baiting them earlier in the season 43:13 Notre Dame as a closer shutout Miami 44 they're nothing it's 1410 Notre Dame on the Alabama get a second account red leaves in the planner whoever touches this first pass red make first ago get two men on in most of the time but this time it's a oneonone situation lunch oneonone it's the off pattern five wheeler and I'm sure the winner was thinking of it there's been a swing at me like that I got to run to get enough padding to get open it was long overdue and a oneonone situation with the speed and size advantage that wheeler has he figures could be able to get away from Rudnick and now the tenth play of this Drive that started at the 8th sixteen to 1014 and Jackson hurt himself I really think he's all right with me he got through to the back a little bit but he's going to take it off he just wasn't going to be the knight on that one he flipped the afterburner if he saw that opening now it's a twopoint lead Bala Bama will they try for the TIC conversion yes sir I would assume so I think so to protect against make sure of it and protect against the field goal by Thomas enlargement 93 yard drive powerful Alabama and Bill Davis mix at 1714 Alabama regaining the lead Notre Dame led first Alabama came back and it's been seesaw and rightfully so from two of the finest teams in the country for the McArthur bowl a national title we'll be back I must get our cheerleader of Alabama and not so muscular purpose no Dresden 93 yards 10 plays Alabama with the extra point now leads Notre Dame 1714 Dominican hunter await the Davis kick this is geminate coming out to the five the 10 hunter blinking giving it down at about the 22 mm marker is on the artificial turf 24 yards return notice how that kickoff team sealed off this was quite a bit longer we're talking the first half hearted very difficult to time those blocks and that kick was in the air long enough that they got penetration deeper down the field Dave Casper talking to the referee as a penalty against Notre Dame a cut now Notre Dame is in the very situation Alabama within just a few moments ago alibi completely down field from their own six the drive for the lead touchdown let's see what Notre Dame can do in two similar conditions putting this game in perspective Alabama took the whole first quarter trying an effect to study the Notre Dame defenses they learned something because ever since they've been dominant offensively now hunter is in the backfield so as Pennock number 34 from the eighth Alabama's defense is fighting mad they fired number 63 Greg Montgomery on the tackle Pennock shaken up on the play at halftime deputy pointed out that he felt it was essential for Notre Dame to throw the ball more than they had after their first touchdown drive I'm certain that Air Farce agent is well aware of that and that will see the Irish go with some playaction passes soon in the backfield 2530 bullet 23 past second down to 12 and about the six Hunter in motion Clements the yard put it down at 13 coming up Mike Washington catching the quarterback Clement we always are debating whether you ought to throw it when you're inside your own 10yard line but if you have a quarterback of experience he's not going to risk a pass that statement out of bounds or just eat the ball it's a safer play as anything you can run because anytime you exchange the ball you may firm enough for quarterbacks got it all away on the pass 30:13 demo over the far Bullock there's a lone setback hunter in motion in his own end zone Clemens Clemens gets out Mike comes out to the 10 or 11 Mike DuBose number 54 so now it's going to be a 4th down and 8 there's DuBose watching watch him break in he's blocked hard I think the clock made by Casper then he moved to the outside that Clements was almost trapped for a safety I think it was arranged that got in there Clemens had jumped him and ducked out to avoid to safety and we now have Notre Dame in punt formation Bama fans stomping in this stadium here jillaine Stadium the pump 5 Daugherty out of the end zone up high in the area Shelby looks at it loses it for a while did he get it down 8:47 notredame that's a lot better field position thus far Alabama's had the ball in their own 11:17 2720 seven but this time they've got it in an Irish territory on the exchange and Notre Dame must now prove it can stop this Alabama attack it hasn't been able to since the second quarter began Richard Todd is the Alabama quarterback number 14 Vennela Bama from the Notre Dame 48 there he goes but look at that marvelous ladies number two on the team they just surgical away they pick off the blockers that they're supposed to take adjusted is done it took them a quarter to do it they did I think a first town in the first quarter but his howard said since that time it's been a surgical touch 17yard gain we just received word that Eric clinic the fine back of Notre Dame has a bruised foot they're not sure if he'll be back in the lineup first intended for Richard Todd pounds in during that time and comes the play watching the radius green books number 10 first started picked up considerably since at with zero the first quarter its second down and seven coming up to the 8 minute mark of the third quarter alabama leading 1714 five a twenty four gary po temple number 88 on Tulsa Oklahoma defensive back now the lineup mica stock outcomes Wilbur Jackson number 80 there's nobody ever running tired on an Alabama team they alternate free backfield they have so many players that clea why they explode usually in the fourth quarter to the far side third and six from the 27 Richard Todd Billingsley carried Mike and Sherman Smith 55 I had that play read Mike Townsend the strong safety you can see him reading here and this is a way to play against this type of offense where they're sliding down the line is for Mitch Townsend won't even sure the fullback W habit then moving up no one got to him that time he was not coming up very rapidly but he met it at the line of scrimmage now a 45 yard attempt by Davis Alabama's 1714 as we have New Years Eve Notre Dame five times national champion in their long storied exciting history 43 46 47 49 shared it with Michigan State in 66 they trail now for the national championship 14 to 17 third quarter Clements from the 22 Bullock look for about five yards I think but we must make the point that both of these teams have shown character when they had to Notre Dame had to stop Alabama Matt last Alabama Drive otherwise the game could have gotten hopelessly out of hand there ravely doing Notre Dame had to come back when Alabama first took over the lead they did it with a kickoff return for a touchdown but Alabama on it's bob has come back twice to to take the lead second down and six down to 24 slicing through Artfest he was carrying the ball that time was all the Notre Dame backs to very low weight forward where it's difficult children stop them and always straight ahead but straight line you don't see Notre Dame accent too far see him now it's third down and 2 we have a pair of tight ends Robin Weber 91 and Casper 86 if it's true I hope their parents are watching that's the yardage they need double wing formation big block gone by Bullock Tyrone King forcing cutter out of bounds but it's a Notre Dame first down very good call and we're expecting the inside play they have been going inside on the short yardage plays that time it was just a straight sweep I'm still looking for the first down pass to demo I agree with Duffy they've got to get back mix it up demo lay 85 Howard ladies and gentlemen is on the near side of the field split it again double wing with a festive motion goes to best traffic jam what a beautiful defensive play DuBose number 54 he has been given and Bear Bryant said at the start of the practice season in fact it's spring practice last yeah at earlier this year years about to end so it gets a little confusing at the moment he told Dubois you're gonna have to earn that number because a fella named Leroy Jordan used to wear it he has earned it alright second and ten thanks to Mike DuBose clutter in motion the fake tone Clements has it Casper is going deep shorter pattern that was Timberlake it's the same pattern Chris that Duffy was talking about at halftime they hit it three times on the first touchdown drive and dem Aliyah was wide open on it again he crosses the field all the way you can see him here as he starts across the field and we had a graphic of this theory earlier in the game where he's got to find some open slots let's watch lower number 47 he's trying to come with him but you can see when the quarterback is running to the bottom of the screen it's very very difficult to keep a crossing man covered all the way he should have had that fall and that double wing to the far side on a third and 10 in the 38 Hunter in motion they claim he blocks Clements rolling like Washington 27yard Jane Casper is a great athlete he was of course a defensive tackle we also hollered is one of the 33 football winners of a $1,000 NCAA postgraduate scholarship and five other those college tip winners are going to play in postseason bowl games tomorrow and he also won was the scholar athlete the National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame in New York Howard hee hee a young man and a big man before from the 35 of Alabama Hunter very good defensive play as number 56 of Notre Dame was avoided Frank comma Rico Alabama's John crow made the play there is number 83 he came in tough enough and a sharp enough angle to close off the inside and then rebounded off the block to close it off outside Oh an exciting game we hope and pointing out again the total yards Alabama's zero in the first quarter and look at they then in second from West fire on the third second of 12 was in the vicinity on them this pattern just says it was plummet stop that Emily was going to break to the outside he broke in well gentlemen this Saturday on ABC's Wide World of Sports East meets West and they hula bowl live by the satellite from Honolulu Hawaii featuring top college football players from around the country including highspin Trophy winner Johnny cappelletti from Penn State Outland Trophy winner Johnny Hicks of Ohio State East is led by allamerican quarterback David James of Kansas the West by Dave White of Arizona all right now it's third down at 12 voter Dame in the white jerseys chanting 1714 from the Alabama 37 attended for Hunter I'm not sure that he wanted to catch it decision I think going to lose 10 if he did make the catch that missed pattern was costly Gemelli was free my crane put the rush on Tom Clements the junior quarterback from McKees Rocks Pennsylvania 54 yards and the following wind on he put everything he has into it shark you think he had a straight Bob Thomas tries a 54yard field goal so in our two fields all attempts a 45 yarder for Alabama 54 by Notre Dame to no avail four minutes to go third quarter we had showers earlier in the evening you could see the water on the colleague turf artificial turf is still there not as much as there was Alabama has it following a Miss 54 yard field goal first and 10 not the quarterback getting to the number three fullback freshman Calvin Culliver Alabama played 60 men in the first half which gives you some idea of the depth of that squad that says I said how they wear him down one game they played 72 they average 66 in 11 games and let's shift them around and peps on the opponent second down and eight 20 which in time by Notre Dame's defense on Willie Shelby number forty Gary put tempeh 45 and on the play mihalick here comes Danny reg way the message carrier who has more yardage than any back he's a kind of a cross country man you'll see him jogging back out there he goes the college rule you don't have to stay in for a play as you formerly used to hunt was 16 the nurse out of the field third down and nine is absent so they have rest of their regular ends yes and I think he caught it in the air Chris well that's the first one in this app we had only one turnover for each team in the first half it has been gets the big break and they burned it because suddenly they've learned how to defense Alabama in the last two series I think they've been guessing and guessing very well its last three snaps it looked to me like they were playing run all away and Alabama will come back with some passing next time they get it now to test the Alabama defense at the 12 of the Crimson Tide first down Notre Dame best in motion clinic back in the lineup shades of the 85 yard touchdown run play against the University of Southern against the flow beautifully executed we were talking at the start of the show Howard it's that full back fake up the metal it freezes those linebackers and when you get the hole open and turn the corner and what is exactly the same play that hooked the back of the Trojan as expected a fantastic game five lead changes thus far we're still in the third quarter with two and a half minutes to go as you look at coach Paul Bear Bryant and go tear up our sigit whose wife Katie's a great young lady talking about his intensity I asked for once that he had butterflies before game she said butterflies no but Eagles the point after good five Bob Thomas so Notre Dame now has a four point lead 21 to 17 mrs. Kasper leading the play and what a marvelous Crocky through Kasper is 240 pounds he's 63 he was an offensive tackle prior to this year but he's been a most effective pass receiver let's watch the play again motion coming this way pull back hitting inside Kasper ahead of it oh he cleaned it up and it was home free pathetic finisher didn't have much of a sore foot did he it's repaired in a hurry this young man at 2:30 Eastern 1:30 central 1 Pacific time on most of these stations on Sunday this week well he shall be back there that's a touch back so Alabama will get it back out at 7:20 but and he wisely played that Christie caught the hit the ball first out in the field of play and some young men that don't have good poise think that they got to pick it up and run with it then but the momentum of the kick put it across the goal line and he knew it was a touchback good decision exactly so yet it's the second kickoff that's been mishandled miss Florida by the tide Calvin Culliver did it earlier they overcame that with their 94 yard drive 190 94 they're so fired up they can't wait for the ball to come down now Gary Rutledge will quarterback Alabama number 11 from the 28 first down they trail 21 17 driving hard balls 58 number 24 Reggie Barnett along with Gary hook tempo the rest of the Notre Dame defender Sherman Smith 55 nice brush 60 stock 48 browner 89 Rudnick 7 Townsend 27 Bradley 20 Garnett 14 Collins number 50 eightyeight fallen huddle you sometimes think it's going to be a involved play when they stay in the huddle at lon quarterback when he was sitting everybody understands the signal second down to three for Alabama placed down for the tide five eight Collins tackling areas number 50 I'm trying Michigan let's watch Collins again he's great he's lined up on the line of scrimmage this time but he is a linebacker as you can see doesn't charge he simply moved laterally came back off the line of scrimmage to make the tackle I'll tell you that's cry he's a great athlete he's a superb baseball player by the way hit three home runs in one game seven RBIs Johnny sharp was 16 set away to the near side first and 10 to 35 Rutledge wants to throw throwing deep that was a little questionable Hubbard that was few number 88 and covering number 1494 Arnett there is Wayne wheeler the end for Alabama he's got some kind of a little hip pointer thing looking at how they were checking his pad their Pugh number 88 is out of the Alabama lineup you're looking at Jackson at the moment taking news in place as Ron Dyer of Florence Alabama number 86 second in town hand off trouble well Notre Dame has changed their defensive alignment they've got seven men on the line of scrimmage playing head up with everyone there are no linebackers but the linebackers are not charging but your Alabama you're not sure with somebody Brian F alignment like a lineman he's not going to charge so it's confused that momentarily started out six to nothing Alabama came back made the extra point to lead seven to six then touchdown and two point chased at 14 to 12 and knows what but was talking about the men up front and he was in bounds on the play apparently right here at about the 44 sharpless number 16 Sharples did not run the pattern deep enough to make the first down which of course is a critical mistake the receiver must get to the pad least to the point where the dr. risk so it is both down now fourth down and one dan has averaged 44 than half yards per kick going back deep now is roughing number seven number 34 Bob not this week tune in for the premiers in his Sunday edition of ABC's Wide World of Sports the everpopular hollenberg riders will be back playing their own unique style of basketball from London England and from Oahu Hawaii not surfers around the world attempt the treacherous waves of the fans I plan in the Hawaii master Surfing Championships hey bud you're getting pretty good at reading those fours it's important because there's so many good events people know about ok Pennock what one way and best has gone the other that gives you an idea of what best is really like and the Notre Dame players felt there was a hit late especially number 71 of Notre Dame felt that that was the case Steve Sylvester but his teammates quickly came out and doing the talking for the Notre Dame team number 56 Palmer Rico and it is just that a late hit and the misdirection of the Notre Dame attack the last couple of times they certainly say a lemon personal foul against the tie that's our cross leg penalty because it puts the ball at the 47 we can see the late hit here is best shakes loose from one tackle and there's Howard pointed out if Notre Dame backs they string line and toward the goal line and there was the late difference Boston 15yard penalty 27 seconds too many clerks brought in first at 10:00 at the Alabama 47 bullet destroyed the first touchdown of the game is hard to stop that gives you some idea I believe the strength of the Notre Dame backs and also they're faking does our cameramen don't lose that bar leverage Alabama is complaining about a slow whistle on the play apparently to no avail see what Jim Calhoun helping helping the runner got to do it on his own in other words no one to put hands on him and pushing or pulling we know back in the early days of football we used to have a very small quarterback and he'd have two people in the backfield and they'd throw him over the line and then another trick that people used was to have a handle on the canvas vests at football players used to wear and the ball tray would grab the handle of a man who was blocking ahead of him and pulling through the line so the rules committee felt he shouldn't help the ball carrier who told you this Pudge Hamilton Pudge is one of the people that did it a matter of fact I didn't know him when I was a kid growing up in Minnesota all right first down now from the 45 first and eight really as time has expired in the third quarter so the next step will actually be the initial one in the fourth quarter with the score Notre Dame 21 Alabama 17 we pause now for station identification cutter Dame will go from right to left for the first down and eight at the 45 of Alabama Notre Dame leads 21 17 piston motion plummets keeps as DuBose and Tyrone King and the play is stopped if a 39 the game is sick so it'll be second down and two that's always been one of the toughest places for most coaches to defense because you're keying the other backs and when the quarterback runs a designed counter play and they're reading the flow of the other backs it's a difficult difficult thing breaks down all the other keys in the game with five lead changes in each quarter of period art best number 23 very little bring it up third down so what we're facing right now is the last 15 minutes for the championship of the 1973 football season of all the many hundreds of colleges and universities here in the state's two undefeated untied teams here on New Year's Eve battling it out for the McArthur Bowl third best in motion she has it this down and more oh look a lot one of those floats in the parade along with his teammate Erik Clinic that's what I meant when I said early in the game he's the free spirit as you're looking at the third Florida statistics and you can't be yeah 278 to 273 possession Alabama has really dominated it in the second and third quarters they only had the ball a little over four minutes in the first quarter I invest in Motion's on the 25 first down get shot you know the statistics that really but a hundred one plays in three boys that's that tempo that we've been telling come out hard you know why I'm so thin the big thrill of it you don't get to play off in his college football 11 games this season when they get the shot they're always ready but just like the other games in this century Notre Dame Michigan State the 6061 Nebraska Oklahoma this has lived up to everything we expected for the national championship red Legion Alabama both tip making the tackle wheeler has a muscle poll number 80 tune a number one pass receiver so Sharples has been in the Alabama liner for that reason number 16 a very fine senior in the six footer he's capable Chris he thought the passes this year for average 4.6 yards per reception but at this point have to start to go over here where the line is he to see if Notre Dame's got seven men in the line of scrimmage there's just not much room to run and to Sharples he has it at the 35 a six 15 yard jimin's you're almost certain you're going to get oneonone coverage this is Rudnick going against Jeff Costa he breaks outside there can't be two men out there cooking one when you've got 7 min up trying to stop the run there is coach era farce Egan Miami was pointing out that he was out of bounds before he caught the ball so let's take a look at it again and see if there is correctly obviously not college football one foot in you're all right all right first down pass by Alabama to the same man but the ball is intercepted retching farting that let's see it again and lustin truck was making the break he's open and there's the pass and he had it in his fingers for a minute but as it popped up he could not hold it as the turnovers now are three on the pride of Alabama to run the fraud of Notre Dame let's watch it again this is the small margins that we talked about in that pass been thrown just one yard further to the right it might have been a touchdown by Sharples rather than intercepts you need a few breaks in football and his man beat then loses it so Notre Dame now at its own 32 and a half first down double wing best again in motion art best southport remember motor named plans will have a lot to look forward to to the heart best two more years is low makes the stop 47 there he is in the middle of your screen reading the plane went away from him he chases it and he's got that speed he talked about all that all evening he's able to run him down from behind as he turns up field please Emily now to the nearside clinic in motion it goes from the 25 the 35 the 40 david McMakin recovers an alabama live a first down at the Notre Dame 40 great battle the best since the Battle of New Orleans in 1815 I'm sure everything we agree with you think Notre Dame leads fourthquarter Alabama just recovered another fumble with the turnovers now three and three wall spy be carried from the 40 of Notre Dame Fanning on the tackle speaking of good coaching good game preparation Alabama that solid that defenses that Notre Dame was using in the first half but took him one quarter to do that and Notre Dame now has gone to the defense on the last several plays of seven men on the line of scrimmage only four men deep and they're going into it again they've one lane back to back this time he's right now surplice to the nearside second and seventh from the 36 Billingsley Lois phone moving ahead and Greg Collins again along with Luther Bradley forcing him out I mentioned earlier when we showed Dubois number 54 that he had to earn his number Leroy Jordan had wanted originally Billingsley was given number 22 Johnny Musso his old number he got hurt as you look at the turnovers and Bear Bryant told them he'd have to earn number 22 back he said I don't want it I want to make number 26 memory big first down but yes it surely is and finish that but I was saying about the defense when you use the defense in the second half the coaches really have a hard time adjusting because they don't have a calm time to explain it first in ten from the 28 Rutledge has the ball for Alabama keeps an employee by Guess Who rollin melons run a game he's played a junior linebacker he'll return for the Fighting Irish Bradley let's see Luther Bradley goes limping off the far side I don't think there's anyone do Notre Dame would less like lose at this point and this is view coming down field at him right into the nine and the man he laid out for that physician mike Parker will take his place number 33 a junior from Cincinnati Ohio so now it's a second down and nine from the 27 of Notre Dame Billingsley stop the 25 Smith made a great recovery he's the open side linebacker forum muttered aim this year coach era parse Egan has never been behind going into the fourth quarter Todd now is the quarterback Rutledge coming over along with Jackson Mike stock is in at left halfback for Alabama on a third down and seven nine minutes 54 seconds left in the game not the old single wing we used to call it the trench time like stop that boy we were talking about from Elkhart Indiana I told you draw pass before Rizzo or his dad didn't give the coaches any information today Todd the quarterback we took the past 25 yards Alabama leads 2321 down here is the pride for the point Bradley's holding Bill Davis ticking it and it will be mix it it'll put Alabama half no good does that anything that these two teams would not miss an extra point nine minutes 39 seconds remaining in the ballgame Alabama 23 Notre Dame 21 on New Year's Eve a Dazzler by the Crimson Tide most teams are not equipped really to cover the quarterback because they don't assume he's going to be a pass receiver stock throwing the ball back to Todd and you can say that there is no one around him is the end sharpless went across the field taking the corner man with him and he was wide wide open now we have 125 Dominick 28 back deep the winning the Alabama kick each team has missed an extra point in this battle for the national championship the MacArthur bowl which we'll be awarded after the game nine that's given ik in the five ten to Notre Dame 15 falls forward at about the nineteen down play very quickly you had said bud the old transcontinental out of the single wing we used to call it and of course the great exponent of the single wing with the late dr. John Bane Jacques Sutherland I remember back in about 1940 leaving the then Brooklyn football Dodgers against the monsters of the Midway the Chicago Bears the Dodgers pull a play for a touchdown a spark Oh was that tailback before was handed up to the wing back banks McFadden out of Clemson he threw down field of Farkas suddenly a receiver and for the only fine all the way for the score it's true please their guard when he was a boy okay a 125 Clinic 44 Bullock number 30 are in the Notre Dame backfield with how much the quarterback Alabama called for a timeout another Howard tell us a little about the hour I'm going to watch it because I've known you a long time I know nothing about an interesting friend and what do you mean they filmed you I have but they filled me for a span of many months NFL Films in the cinema verite snout but I've not seen the show I hope they show their wife and two charming daughters I've got to otherwise I'm Madonna but you haven't changed your character for month to month hey you know the superstars returns to ABC Sunday January 27th with some of the world's greatest athletes it's gonna be a great series guys like Reggie Jackson Petey rose Jimmy Palmer tug mcgraw Jason Sammy Jo green for wolf Paul Warfield Philly to me Tim Ryan Lee Evans just a few many many more Johnny have look you're gonna love it 23:21 alibi sixthly change is put to the test first in town from their own nineteen and there's how hunter the freshman we had a 94 yard touchdown tonight there is number 95 or 25 he was stopped by Ricky Davis 19 and 54 Mike DuBose after a 15yard gate and that's the first time we've had the reverse off the fullback fake and the normal swing off tackle caught Alabama going to the bottom of your screen Steve quale is in an offensive left tackle for the Fighting Irish number 77 from the 33 burst in town 8 minutes 50 seconds to go in the game he picked up that yardage on his own but stripped of his blocking he was able to turn that phone Carol King who missed the tackle is one of these sure tacklers that Alabama has he just gave him that little inside Juke and then had speed enough to get around gaining five yards bring it out to the 38 of Notre Dame second and five eight 21 left in the game Alabama leading 23 21 so much at stake now for the double wing Hunter goes in motion a fake handoff the clinic and clemont's keeps it beyond the line he'll run it 360 yards gained on the ground this year for the junior from the keys rocks Pennsylvania he gets a first down for the Irish we talked about Howard castles and large show titled what does he really like they are special spotlights him at 2:30 Eastern 137 go 1 o'clock Pacific time or most of these ABC stations on Sunday all right quarterback gets outside the containment it's always going to be big game 2:46 of notre dame first and bullet number 30 skipped Kabila's 72 and 50 Wayne Hall off on the ball so fast I thought he was a that's right he's had that problem from time to time he's been called offside the opinion of Alabama when he hasn't really been on engaged let's see if he was here there's the move and yet don't know if I don't think he'd been approached he was moving before the ball move but I don't think he didn't coach down the neutral zone but on second down at 10 mark 21 is the Stanford to commence number two a Notre Dame Clemens has time now he's down the line again the savers covered mainly Prem mercy will repaired the babe Casper was accorded double coverage Alabama have the Russian on Clements has got that great speed and movement back there but that have been any kind of an inside setup to throw the ball he'd have been for long long loss well Notre for long long loss well Notre Dame as we look at Jerry Rutledge of the Huck Finn tight live head from fight alabama now at the 45 it's a third and one for Notre Dame Clements Casper's out there Casper deep would you believe no I don't he had double Oh really the ball this is why it helps to be 63 of 240 he uses his body beautifully against the gate he simply turned and gave Ricky Davis a basketball block and he is so big and strong a sensational catch on Casper's part as for two catches 48 yards first and 10 for Notre Dame at the Alabama 15 6 minutes 26 seconds left in the game Alabama leading 23 21 yes litter rather excuse me number 25 now best is coming back into the lineup Pennock 44 is going on in an Alabama player hard hitting on this artificial trip tonight in this championship game it says more than lived up to all of our expectations what over three years a country John Crowell against in Alabama who keep identifying the home bases of these players note that most of the Alabama players peddling 50% of them come from within the state of Alabama on the contrary Notre Dame players come from all over the nation six minutes seven seconds left in the game 23:21 Alabama a lot of time left six minutes and five seconds that was John Cole just as soon as we can second in 1704 Pennock point in motion the nearside clements keeping limits number two on the move clemont's out of bounds at about the five perhaps inside ability opponents to turn the corner he Bennett consistently on this Drive Alabama's defensive campaign man has been caught inside because of the lateral movement when the faking of the I respect eight yard gain first and goal Howard at before say this but John McKay as he spoke for all the college coaches of the land as long as act water back to run the football we've got an extra dimension and I think that's fill an unchallenged double wing more people in this moment in motion very little gain second down and goal for Notre Dame Rock running four days left in the game with Alabama leading by Q 23:21 miss Notre Dame Lyon is so big their takeoff is so strong it's going to be very difficult for the entire early diagnosis on John Crowell the defensive end of Alabama's but he has not sustained any serious injury he was just knocked out and taking a little long to come back snap back alright second and goal yes touchdown coming up Mike Washington the tide is stubborn and how much bigger that missed extra point by the tide whoo that is right Mike Washington number 34 made a great play here he's would have been troubled by an ankle and came into this game Berra thought he's a little bit doubtful but he was one on one there against best when he stood him off and Leroy cook who took Kroll's place in there also humping third and goal now the tide moving along with Pennock all right Clement still wants to go in the air whoo its fourth down bullet was the intended receiver and so Bob Thomas as we indicated that both have great kickers punters and field goal and now it's up to Thomas on fourth down to put the Irish ahead Thomas has dried missed two from beyond his kicking range but this one is just exactly like an extra point as you can see but that was a tremendous goal line stand so it's from the nine plus the ten of the end zone 19 yards at top end I just made it right folks nineteen yarder by Bob Thomas the senior from Rochester New York watch how close get ordering holding there's the kick definitely it was in that college course weren't wider than the professional posted would have been out four minutes in 26 seconds which to score a filler on New Year's Eve in the carnival city the exciting city of New Orleans Notre Dame has just made elites for the seventh time kicking a 19yard field goal to lead 2423 notre dame kicking off alabama one point down Robin Carey a great new opportunity for the Crimson Tide it comes down now then to this four minutes 16 seconds left 15 counting down a whole season to superbly prepared unbeaten teams as we watch again how that field goal by Thomas narrowly went in the inside the right goal post opponent at one location pointed out earlier the extra distance between the goal post at the college game level and these two great teams separated by only one point a great kickoff return by Robin Gary the action resumes Chris at the forty first down what leagues is the quarterback loses his footing every layer was Bradley that may be the most expensive slip of the season for Alabama it may be but I'll happy to see it fly to five I've seen them come back so many times in this game and Notre Dame to an Alabama all season 21 points as I said the final quarter against Tennessee trailing Kentucky as we look at the countdown 14 nothing at the half winning growling George snoring two touchdowns in the last five minutes to win it second and 15 the pass intended for sharpest 15 for Alabama and the crimson jerseys three minutes 40 seconds to go 24:23 the first time these two teams have met on the football field once in basketball there's Wayne wheeler the number one pass receiver for Alabama that has not been at the line and I would guess were to look for another trick play like Alabama's touchdown was scored on it don't know what it will be that will be something that's got some unusual movements in it and I would guess it might be a hitch pass in a forward pass freshman Brown browner soup was extraordinary I mention it some minutes ago earlier you saw make an unassisted tackle he's been great 4th down and 20 and here's Greg Gant the Alabama punter averaging 48 point 7 yards per punt and he really needs to hit this one Tim Rudnick and single safety did his job Bay 500 on the oneyard line in 65year the whole arity here are the happiness but this penalty that you're about to see again and here he comes you notice how long the official waited to throw that flag to make sure he thought about it carefully what a tough job their shields have he was not touched on the play and if you are not clocked into it and you failed to get the ball it is roughing the kicker because it's a very dangerous play when a man is standing on one foot and one foot high in the air just can't have that time now three minutes left on the clock the final quarter the biggest game of the year 24:23 Alabama refusing to take the field position itand maybe force them to a safety is what they're thinking about the ball is on the oneyard line if they can penetrate and make the tackle behind the goal line Pamela will go ahead many times during the course of the contest one could have expected that I suppose because of the nature of both teams the coach is the coaching staff and the issue at stake the national championship we were concerned going into the game about whether Alabama's defense would measure up and ferret Brian right now has expressed total confidence in them not taking the roughing the kicker penalty I think it will stop them inside the ten Wayne bullet testing me out two minutes 54 seconds to go Alabama with three timeouts two timeouts Notre Dame has been announced family only two and the clock will come down Notre Dame meets the first town that's all we're thinking about it van was thinking we can't let him have the first end do you have any disposition to secondguess the Bears judgment not if they stop them from making a first down and that's what he was counting on the defense's ability to do I don't know they only had to get to field goal position mimicking motion second and seven and if they stop them on this next play I would feel it the decision has been vindicated but they don't stop them of course it's always that guessing game hard powerful wind blowing from left to right it swirls in that there's a total of 230 won victories 69 losses and 16 ties in 29 years of head coaching or 75% victory made a decision and now his team mess to stop Notre Dame 212 to go third and five for the Irish that was a big big penalty they're back again now where it's only half the distance so they're not going to be quite as close to the goal line as they were when they had at first intent this is the dream match the most important game of the year Notre Dame in Alabama at Notre Dame football is a religion at Alabama it's a way of life Notre Dame 84 years ago Rockne marceia mark third down clemont's coming up is it mad Robyn Weber number 91 a sophomore from Dallas Texas give Tommy Clements Orlick credit top of the show he was a young and his favorite receiver was Gemelli he could he cleared that out the second favorite but he proved that out as you look at the scoreboard clock and now to number 81 what a clutch plate 34 yards first down at the 38 and there's coach Paul Bear Bryant fifty sixyearold 24:23 leading up the clock in that decision when they made the first down up there it's going to be secondguessed but how can anybody have a second guest this man no coaching greatness a legend so the ball at the 39 at second down and nine for Notre Dame minute 34 to go Notre Dame danai in the center he's done a great job very steady his best closing nation one point differences kuvira's and lower on the tackle one more down to take their last time out they stopped a Notre Dame here and pours it into a punting situation they will take the timeout third down and seven coming up the ball at the 41 I don't think you'll find this to clements throwing on this occasion Pennock is out so here may come some sort of a special play we have putter 25 Bullock 30 best 23 and Emily goes to the far side he's got a feel if everybody would agree hard before he's going to do it again except he can roll he was just missed him he gets out across the 47 no we made the first tackle who talk about butterflies leathery faces down in a matter of seconds they're going to see Paul Bear Bryant and Arif are seeking go over and shake hands with one another era for all his greatness has never had a perfect season a unanimous national title and he may have that in about getting about seconds he's just about got it the most valuable word Clements deserves the award he's just gotten the most valuable player in this all game sixty minutes has been compacted triumph defeat pain despair ten football coming up 30 seconds to go 29 just helpless with the ball now if a 49 is a second down and nine there is no feeling coach has after a great effort like this and you know there's no more shot 7 of 12 for clements 178 yards passing 13 rushes 71 yards 249 he gained about 1 their comments 3 seconds to go here on the New Year's Eve party 5th guy he's only 15 or 20 yards away from Anderson throw that ball about 45 yards and throw it right on stride was a remarkable play let's don't forget that 19 yard field goal by a man named Bob Thomas the senior from Rochester New York always when you look back at a game you think it's a mistake missed extra point Notre Dame it missed one on a bad snap some sent up on atone for it with the gambling to coin play that works successfully again Sammy Clemens throwing just over roads and into peaked Emily hey Kelly look at the expressions on those people's faces that's ecstasy worked all season is dressed Avada than it happened all right three seconds",

  "transcript": "Ohio State's drive went 66 yards before it was stopped kenkun there's a cross kick again as the ball and every time they kicked a shirt they given us the excellent field position and it's the kind of club for this throwing ability that's dangerous to give them care we heard so often how teams are fired after another team scores we've seen us Ohio State now respond twice we saw USC come back USC now in great field position excellent runners they could put it up in the air they'll probably try ad hundred yards you see for Anthony Davis the sophomore and 16 carries first down southern calendar 44 they're leading 14 to 10 midway in the third period they spent Swan and motion the faith and he fires the completion in drag of 35 Martha's making a tackle on lynn swann whose clot free passes here in the second half USC is doing it in the air now they can't move much on the ground there it is again Jerry wasn't much of a fade the balanced attack of USC has really helped out the passing game just come on Ohio State is shut off if you can call shutting off a 100yard runner being shut off they should have to run fairly well variety of teams have ever had as many outstanding receivers on one college team as USC has to pitch it to Davis he's pushed to the 30 and to the 26 yard line before he's blocked out by rich Parsons 7 yard gains negative 3 we fought weakly for station identification this is the NBC television network now john mckay sends in sam cunningham replacing Manford more pull back that last drive Ohio State had they used up four minutes and nine seconds getting that field goal he daesil garrisons frets to the left second down three or four US v Davis down on the 26 yard line by George Hazen Howe the left tackle of Ohio State number 70 it'll be a third down and three to go for us see a new Roseville record crowd today one hundred six thousand eight hundred sixty nine hundred and broke nearly hundred and seven thousand regatta relatives in here does make it a hundred to seven times up to this point that Hazen oil really has shown a lot on defense two third third and three Cunningham picks up the first down bambams in for the 20 yard line both on the tackle for Ohio State along with Hazen Hall paranoia an opportunity of life both of these teams for week we were tremendously impressed with the athletes their personalities very dedicated young people we spent the whole time yesterday with USC and this is Charlie young was quite impressive here's number 89 that outstanding tight end gal on the Ohio State 20 with a first down Davis Warburton here is a dozen teachers the defense's on both seem the next 40 next balance right there's hairs away from it he stretches out and give you that little leap he danced pretty good here again all right now watch how he breaks tackles he has very strong legs that's his secret an amazing balance and of course we had Mike Garrett Heisman Trophy winner OJ Simpson maybe the best of them all Clarence Davis and others fellow ohio state develops fullbacks USC develops running tailback the kick is good and now for the time out of USC 2105 State then my goal as an individual to be financially independent as a single woman I am very bullish on America Jack Whitaker for Merrill Lynch I've been asking people here in Houston if they're bullish on America so far most of them seem to be but different people have different investment problems I'm very bullish at this time I'm retired and investment is what I live on my biggest financial challenge will be getting making sure that these two girls of mine 10 and 14 get a good education which is as you know becoming more expensive all the time different people are bullish on America but with different investment problems that's why Merrill Lynch has 29 different ways to invest and common stock is just one of them ask Merrill Lynch which ways they think are best for you Marilyn twentynine ways to help you share in America's growth drogyn horses named traveller too it was an animal Anthony Davis will kick off and he pulls this one Hegel's coming back with it Lari we have a flag drop being yards at a time the difference first of all in the Ohio State 36 yard line at the personal foul against southern cow my estate first out under 36 what's that for McCain wants to know we've seen it three times now Curt the teams are responding one team scores and the other team comes back we've said it before a high estate has done it twice they've got another chance now 546 to play in the third quarter 21 to 10 in favor of USC red hair gives the ball enriched galvo jobless to raise 38minute the Trojans are stopping the old house they running games them second down eight remember Nebraska against Notre Dame coming up next in the Orange Bowl from Miami Florida right after we leave the air here from Pasadena the Orange Bowl on NBC heard the are stuff in the big shopping in a slow play but none of his quick hitting them down eight weight was gonna be a troll there gets it out completes it who hasn't Ohio State here it is again good shot from the end zone he's almost pulled down here gets it off in desperation cuts in Graham coming over the top here's another indication of strength pulls away from Dale Mitchell almost breaks it gets a side swipe in the bone though Archie Griffin fumbled three times and lost in the Michigan game in fumble twice today a fortunate recovery there by Jim Fraggle the guard and Ohio State has the first gun in the Southern California 7 Griffin lamb down only 47 by Jeff Winans who made a tremendous charge at time and helps the freshman kid up now Ohio State has moved to more slam tonight first rather than that straightup looking at the middle guard and trying to go either way the running running backs have been picking he has now changed it a bit he'll probably go back to the straight first then the poly frost comes enter the wide receiver replacing Bradshaw second down 10 the goal for Ohio State around the southern cal 47 this thing and it Griffin's at the 35 and have a first down I'll tell you one thing I like this Harris composure factor twice released his ball at the last possible second and coolly fished out the safety valve man little Griffin how about you said Griffin Curt how about him freshman here he is responding in a biggest game of his life and he's always in the right spot I've seen a lot of seniors come into a Rose ball in half problem an 18 year old freshman has played a brilliant game today for Ohio State Archie Griffin so has a sophomore Anthony Davis for USC the highest face fall first down trying to run that power slant it only goes for two but Charles asked and he floods it up number 55 the dentist thought we'd see more greg hare running an option in practice they showed quite a bit if it maybe was employed by Woody Hayes show it in practice but don't show it in the game we know that great hair can do it well he had a big run against Michigan to help break open that game 21 to 10 the score USC leading it was tied seven all at halftime Ohio State has a second down eight on the USD 33 there was it four out of six Phyllis remember away Greg Harris issue that will not quick lap carried if you want to see great speeds they say John Hicks is an allamerican he's been fellow that stopped this play because he came clear across the field after the interception you seen John Hicks 74 big man cuts it off here that's what really prevents a CD so all the Ohio State Buckeyes had a drive going here it is watch it tip off the hands of Johnson and Charlie Phillips a sophomore from Pasadena playing in his hometown takes off and now the Trojans have the ball on the Ohio State 33 48 yards on that interception return Swan going in motion Mike ray on the counter since I was 15 McPherson i'm anthony davis on way you have this J here in the Rose Bowl just a beautiful personal duel now between AG Anthony Davis goodlooking bird quit flocking he and Griffin bird I will be at all surprised if we see this man gain 200 yards for his fullback 145 yards on the ground a sophomore playaction pass complete to fairly young and young goes to the green and our rain is mixing him up inside outside passing a beautiful attack that the Trojans have no wonder they've averaged 36 points in the game they could hurt you in a lot of ways you know John Mackay said it's all be tough getting ready for a pole game he's played three that's what he hates he's played three games in two months and it's very difficult to get your team sharp I think that first half has helped us see they have a two fullbacks in there now Anthony Davis leaves the game let's see they dive Cunningham again he's great on that dye play there he goes in his escort a flag is down though it drops the flag offside against Ohio State banned decree is arguing number 88 okay talking about Sam Cunningham and the way he died Jack Tatum who played for Ohio State is great at coming over the top you can be sure that's a safety man and earlier in the football game we saw around Parsons come up pretty sharp and Doug finds they're going to be looking for that dive awfully awfully tough though to stop stop this man let's see it from ground level view 39 Sam BAM Cunningham how'd you like to have him coming at you al two hundred and twenty or twentyfive pounds no way the offside penalty against Ohio State is now place with the ball in the yard and a half line Jim Pope has gone out Mike's canal is in they has a first down and goal to go USC coming alive here in the second half there he is again and he's older Sam escort in second diving touchdown well you get another shot of it now everybody's trying to come up Marnell Dave Jones is trying brick fit of Milton astride and there you saw the safety man come up that was Doug blanket he went over the top of fight there it is again this fellow is quite a physical specimen power speed flocking ability intelligence everything the kicked by my crane is up and it's good USC has exploded in the third period they have scored 21 points in this order and with a minute 25 play in the third period our floor is USC 28 now and Ohio State 10 well Woody Hayes is beaten John 2k three out of four times the previous meeting the last time they met they were both undefeated and Ohio State in the 1969 Rose ballgame defeated the Trojans 27 the 16 madigan the tough new york city cop finds himself and Lisbon tracking down his man watched Richard Widmark as Madigan Wednesday night at 8:30 Eastern Time right here on NBC we mentioned that Ohio State can't afford to get behind they do not have the explosiveness that the Trojans have there's 1:25 to go here in the third quarter it's a uphill struggle now for State Anthony Davis will kickoff he hasn't thrown any faster today but he can he was the lefthanded quarterback in high school Cornelius green is the middle man now and he's running up on this one and handled it on a 16 gets back to his 29 and he's it down there for us three by number 37 ten grade and now for car sick number 48 didn't take us see time the score you saw they did it in a minute of 17 seconds after the intercept of that fast well you can't teach quickness or speed that's what USC has and you can go along and suddenly in football that's beefed and explode for you and that's what it's done for USC first down on the 29 yard line of Ohio State the pitch out is the Galvez Rick Galvez and he has pinned in there and contained by number 26 Charley Hinton and now Woody Hayes is going to have to figure out what to do now to open him up anchor2 he tried to go up in the air man we should keep our eye on his number 41 James Sims or Dale Mitchell number 85 we mentioned they play defensive end in the five neither is extremely big but both they're very quick particularly Sims number 41 I'm checking it then Greg Harris fast is knocked away benefit galvo a flag down that's a motion friendly against Ohio State Eddie Johnson knock that away that's the tight end Fred Puckett was talking to his coach Woody Hayes notice the mess Jersey what he knows Kurt he's in trouble it's a different looking team when he when the highest State Buckeyes go away from their game fire another in California decline the penalty 11 in a row they've won the number one ranked team and they figured if they lost this one their season was really sort of a washout and Ohio State came in here with a chance to knock off the number one ranked team fill a bull plenty to shoot for in this game third and 10 Greg Harris can't find anyone open and he flashed it down in a 30yard line they could from behind there by number 82 Lanford a second spring tackle here it is again and when that defensive team knows you're going to pass it makes it a lot easier getting to era pulls it down state is out of their game plan that's obvious Rochford all along with they're going back into punt formation here they want to get this front off before the gun ends the third quarter because they have the wind at their back here's the kick against the role after what appeared to be a bad kick it goes out of bounds as fast the clock that shows the end of the third quarter it's out on a 33 yard line of USC that's the end of the third period in the 1973 Rose Bowl game with the score USC 28 oh hi Jim when you were completely great you did look older I can't believe how much better you look with just a touch of gray announcing Grecian formula 16 is practically clear as easy to use as hair tonic no mess use it every day until you slowly gradually get rid of just as much gray as you want some of it or all of it then once a week or so to keep it that way I use it too and he doesn't even know it Grecian formula 16 the 73 Plymouth Satellite Sebring plus Chrysler Plymouth made little drawing of it so I could show you what's new besides looks quiet exhaust and suspension systems sound barriers in the roof doors around the wheels all over it the new midsized satellite built to be seen not her limits satellite extra care in engineering it makes a difference third galleon healthy regattas fourth buried at the Rose Bowl USDA at twenty eight ten it was seven seven at halftime radish yard led the Ohio State team of tackles with seven little finesse tricks and the 3/5 Anthony Davis to a 38 yard line Afeni fie Randy Gradishar mrs. Nixon in the white suit first lady here today from the family the winner of white house out here in the west coast we've had a good day as Mike gray he has completed 16 out of 20 two passes for 196 yards and they needed his passing arm here to break things open in the third quarter Anthony Davis with a 40 look at him go into the 45 and he has a first down again Rick Middleton was a man that finally had a stopping you can't see enough of Anthony Davis just enjoyable watching this man run goes away from one he hits a bunch of people right here and Alice off for Anthony Davis who didn't start who was the third string tailback when the season opens the USC is going to challenge the alltime Rose Bowl record here today of 194 yards on the ground as you see has a hundred and fifty seven Bob Peter of Iowa's depth that record of 1959 45 yard line for no game by Charles E crop that time speaking of that church Sam Cunningham will have an opportunity to tie a very old record here of Elmer late Leighton's of Notre Dame 1925 against Stanford Laden had 18 points up at this point Cunningham has 12 like an INT and Davis goes out to the big hand number 28 he needs 40 some yards to break the alltime Roseville rushing record there are 13 minutes to play USC's ahead 28 10 lag drop too much time against USC moves the ball back to their 40 make the second down and 15 on that 18point scared also exactly Weisenberger of michigan had a sheen mal anthony also had a teen that was in the michigan Oregon State game in 65 the referee Dave Kaminski you saw with that said no the track and field coach at Cerritos College 22 years he's been an official and colleague over 50 they go to the 46 at Sam Cunningham and boy what a hole he usually makes the holes at this time he has it good hole card they get far that's the center popping on arnoldjones but this is the speed that Kurt was talking about earlier he can really accelerate he he get to that safety man as quickly as I've seen that was number 24 coming up Ralph forces Southern Cal on the Ohio State 47 third down and two for a thriving pushing as a first down for Southern Cal Anil house 843 the cream made the tackle for the Buckeye throw down to 44 you know these six officials in the games three from the pack eight and three from the Vic ten have 130 years of officiating experience they all average 21 years of officiating have you done a very fine job today first down USDA Ohio State 44 Swan in motion lay off throw it again if he's been on the run younger they dropped in at the 31 he was hit by number 20 Neil cozy but another first down for us see young Nozick is caught strict passion barely you can see why he's an allamerican idea you're right he's a tight end curve but I think he's good enough and fast enough to be a wide receiver rangy boys great hands and you know another good story is this Center I think Dave Brown sort of the spiritual leader of this team he's six foot he's 200 point nine pounds a very dedicated young man number 15 for young Charles youngest top six facet for 82 yards with Park California junior it was the first retail fact at the start of the season finally beaten out by Anthony Davis which is certainly noticed race and Rick Middleton made the tackle on it on a 29 yard line of Ohio State and Southern Cal now dominating he'll do a 7 to 7 tired halftime their passing ability and their speed is taken over that was McNeil first carry in the game Cunningham in a fullback ray going to McKay incomplete you know John McKay distorted the great sense of humor every week they have a recruiting meeting and the Craig Purdy who you'll see talking to McKay the quarterback coach was in charge as a high school area that young McKay and Pat Haden played in so they were talking about it the case that will Hal what about Hayden how do we stand there and he said judge will offer him a scholarship but don't offer them a cake hit one why not he's I can't even get him to empty the garbage let alone coachy they're gone seven roll out and the time janitor receiver Lynn's wine at about giving us a a first down on the Ohio State nine how about my gray though now he's really mixing it up they're going with a fasting attack and he's right on target doesn't look like he's going to do much but that ball seems to get to the receiver hitch they're very high on this one frightfully dangerous attack the cave that held in one tester daejung has six Swan has six catches Davis has three they throw everybody first and goal a call us see the fumbles of our who has it looks like a USC recovery number 57 Dave Brown the center with Glendale though they picked up three yards in the play we were talking about Dave Brown just a minute ago and it's just sheer pursuit he hustles all the time watch over his body will drive Parsons away from the ball that was banned decree who chased him the tree has had outstanding lateral pursuit today running those backs down on the opposite side of the field from him the timeout and with a timeout 9:57 to play in the Rose ball in the store USC 28 oh hi Oh state 10 allstate has life insurance that says you don't have to die to collect it's our money back players you get ten thousand dollars of permanent insurance now all your money back when you're 65 every dime you paid in full state money back you get something back when your loan gets lighter good hands with Allstate young man introducing the 40,000 mile radial tire with five guards to help protect you five ways the nuclear custom steel guard radio helps guard against truck ride the trend against wet skins loss of road contact on curves and against sluggish hand lane with a new Goodyear steel guard radial you get a five guard feeling the confidence of control only from Goodyear second down goal to go for USC like a rays passing figures 18 out of 25 over 200 yards in this game second in seven McNeil Cunningham rich Parsons drove McNeil out of bounds on the two yard line turn and to Manfred Moore comes in number 44 poor defensive tackles in for Ohio State right now they have that Cunningham D or C if he dives again he scored two touchdowns already they give it to him not sure malee have a force sound and I'll put the Gaul we're bound to see tear down an awesome collision I think they're just consistently doing it and they'll probably stay with it again just give it to Sam BAM Cunningham but watch the safety men they're going to be trying desperately but I just don't know how you stop that man Michigan could not punch it in against Ohio State's goal line defense Southern Cal has been able to mostly because of that fella coming fullbacks and the fam Cunningham damn has had a lot of airtime he's probably gonna pilots like a host again watch it let's just take off look at that like the man on the flying craft fees when they cross with that goal line that Hayden will hold raise kick is up and the kick is good and us be pouring it on now in the fourth quarter with a timeout the USC Trojans 35 Ohio State 10 this is the plymouth grand sad a little beauty let me show you something easy to get in and out of plenty room comfortable alright the looks of it I've given a few of these lately when it comes to a fullsize car I don't think you can beat it and love this thing the plymouth grand sedan try one yourself it's a Chrysler Plymouth dealers leaving your lights on for over three hours in freezing cold that's murder but that's what we did with these cards let's see if any of them can start the Sears diehard the diehard extra power to start your car when most batteries all right here we go now at nine minutes of 10 seconds to play USC lead 35 cent it was seven to seven and a half time they was kicking the cornelius green on e for the 20 after the 30 and he's down in his 32 yard line the tackle there by Marvin cough number 24 of us V well now Kurt anything could happen it could be just a it's a protocol already a twenty five point lead but if he puts it in the air he's going to be getting a severe rush the interception a very likely thing really when you're under this kind of pressure and now we have a new quarterback in here now sophomores Steve Morrison of Huntington West Virginia see if he can move them some rich cowboy playing his last game for Ohio State brought down by Jeff Winans the right tackle will be on the 40yard line of Ohio State a gain of eight before that last play USC finally got going and it mounted 399 yards on the attack to 29 by passing at 170 by rushing Ohio State has 260 yards total offense Erol Henson resident is used as much today as everybody thought he would be carries the ball to the 46 yard line for a first down for Ohio State stay tuned right after this game the Orange Bowl in Miami it'll be Nebraska Notre Dame right here on NBC Woody Hayes being played a gallon first half Cowboys for the 49 but finally have been outstripped by the versatility and speed of the u.s. East fly it looks like coach Hayes is kind of admitted that the battle is over there's the bench a very depressed team a very gallant football team they came in here to play and they play they really tested this USC team and they'll go home with a great deal of respect for them under 8 minutes now 7:40 to go second down eight to go for Ohio State flags are down Parsons tossed with grabs off hit from the corner back of the forties up to the 50 45 and his out of bounds New Jersey a senior cornerback I believe the flags against Ohio State if it is us he will have the ball it caught that ball at his own 40 ran about 15 yard and southern challenge the illegal procedure friendly they take the ball over now in the 41 yard line of Ohio State with another chance to score seven and a half minutes to play Charlie hidden carried a fine young man to be storage so told us the other day that he's going back to East Orange to work with young people his major is in community work and I can tell you he'll be well accepted existed outstanding young man first down in motion at Boulware looked like that Hayden's come in now this youngster splat a passer and has complete the match before at the 40 gets his moves in the 30 and it sounds worse than us honey who's made the tackle Pat Haden number 10 one of the greatest high school passes in the history of California football will be the quarterback next year and for sure throwing the ball Johnny McKay said I've never seen a better one and we watched him Tosh Saturday and a workout and he could really deliver that ball beautifully Danielle you really can carries a little concerned about his height 26 foot he seems to deliver it on his toes he's not stretching out just the natural factor first down Southern Cal Anil house.they 26 the pitch is the McNeill and the deal is dropped down on the 23 yard line of Ohio State by Mike Scannell the highest scores in the Roseville USC beats whispered 47 to 14 in 1930 and 1960 3 USC 42 Wisconsin 37 the wildest game ever played here those are just the highest scores for a USC team in the Rose Bowl yardline Jim Fox a Killeen here it is here's a man that lost his job to anthony davis and how many teams would love to have this kind of move Kirti he has I think McKay has quite a few good football players he played against his brother who plays for UCLA first down goal to go for USC leading thirty five to ten six minutes to play seven of seven and half time Pat Haden brought down from behind by a landed Gradishar and we understand why he made the All American teams of the linebacker this season he looked junior champion Ohio he'll be back next year second down now 13 yards to go for a Southern Cal shuts down 49 points is the most any teams ever scored in the Rose Bowl Michigan did it's right 49 yearold John McCain known he said cured the other day that win or lose you know the world kind of goes on and he doesn't take that winter loss he loves to win obviously and he isn't with timeout and our score again USC 35mile State down USC stopped fairly effectively in the first half now is rolled up 427 yards total offense two yards away from the alltime Rose Bowl record baby fast broken up at the goal line by tim fought faster than tenifer Chris Bella second spring tide in 429 yards total offense at the Rose Bowl record set by Iowa's team against Cal in 1959 USC has 427 yards today against Ohio State they now have a third down of 13 to go for a touchdown five minutes of 22 seconds remaining in the game hey watch mara was in the game then they paid chefs out on the one foot line UFC now holds it all total offense record or theme in the Rose Bowl game and there was the fam the phone the human Shannon BAM Cunningham who fought three times has cannonball into the endzone his famous dive is back in now for sound and a yard to go let's really give him the ball again for a record for touchdown in the Rose Bowl game he's a deep man in that eye and he's and he hurling myself full frame fullspeed 267 a founders al talk about instant replay Curt this is the most replayed shot we've had all day he's pretty good you want to go out for the high jumping theme Volta so in his drawing record for Roseville game the kitchen is good by Ray all kinds of new records big set today by the mighty Trojans who are indeed number one time out with a score USC 42 Ohio State Penn you know you could get a better shave if your razor had a second blade why well when you shave your whiskers actually stretched out from your skin but after it's cut it starts to snap back now if you had a second blade right here you could shave that whisker again before it all snaps back so with two blades you'd have a better racer our razor the Gillette track two Gillette made it one blade better a Chrysler has always been an automobile with the tradition of performance on the open road it was an automobile that faced the challenge of LeMond and Saul victory in 56 grand national competitions today the tradition continues with electronic ignition in this 73 Chrysler Newport a Chrysler more people can afford Chrysler Newport extra care in engineering it makes a difference and this is Nixon first lady is leaving and I imagine she enjoyed herself and the parade today and the game as she's seen us he really opened it up here to second half Anthony Davis kicking off to Cornelius green again at the 11:00 he doesn't get far as that for the 25 and that's it met there by Tom Bollinger jr. and we have a flag down also with five minutes of six seconds to play I was handed a wrong record here and I want it correct at 429 yards offense is for rushing that's why the Iowa team and that has not been broken today by USC still quite an impressive performance 42 points against the club the caliber of Ohio State Mary's your clip Ohio State back under 13 the most total net yards 516 in a Rose Bowl game was that Iowa Club up the middle they go arrow Hansen carrying the ball for under five minutes to play now amazing Curt how few people have left this there's Cunningham have left this oval they're starting to leave now but with a hundred and six thousand people here the game totally out of hand now in favor of USC you think maybe there'd be more living quarter of five here on the west coast soon as this players run off tell you why I mention that they run little lip first and second spring tail but right now you would normally be sitting the Orange Bowl game but we're going on here we have four minutes to twenty seconds remaining and as soon as this game is over we'll quickly switch you to the Orange Bowl in Miami for Nebraska against Notre Dame and I don't believe there's any doubt L is the number one college team in America they could be the number one team for quite some time with the ball players we're seeing today Morris or the quarterback up to his 23 yard line we were talking about Richwood thinking about John Mackay and how he gets these young people he did a clinic in Atlantic City New Jersey and rich woods coach at Elizabeth Thomas Jefferson High School in Elizabeth New Jersey we're talking to John McCain and John said look if you ever have an athlete that you think will like would you bring him to it well Mick would who runs 109 eight played offensive guard in high school now is playing linebacker just a sophomore so I guess McKay like that clinic down in Atlantic City there he is first down for Ohio State swim at 23 rich Galvan to the 30 and gets up to he's 32 the answer daily Rex Kern is in the stands today I remember Rex when he was an outstanding quarterback played twice in the Rose Bowl here he was the most valuable player of the 1969 game played in a 71 game when his team was upset by Jim Plunkett and Stanford but he is here in California to be married on January 16 and a future mrs. Ternan was a rose princess the 1968 Rex turn can't be too happy about the outcome of this game and chef Hansen has dropped in his 36 yard line remember Ellen I'll be at the Super Bowl game on January 14th Miami and Washington all the activities will be carried by NBC this year the Super Bowl game January 14th two minutes 45 seconds to play in this game 42 to 10 in favor of USC they have scored 35 points in the second half USC flippers to the 40 45 50 and in the USC territory for a first down they stopped the clock and Johnny McKay is going to have his 100th coaching victory today also very witty man he was described as what happens at a Rose Bowl game with the coaches just yeah I'll tell you about it a minute first out Ohio State lipfird again runs it to the 41 at the kickoff luncheon they're rowing for 3,000 people there so I'll tell you what happened there's across the field for me is woody need ranting and raving up and down the sidelines of course I'm very calm and collected on my sideline and deep down neither one of us knows what's going on second down five Morrison on a quarterback heat with a 35 out of bounds to stop the clock 42 to 10 USC has won the Roseville one the mythical national title with a certainty were there impressive performance here today first John Ohio State they're on the USC 32 yard line Dahmer Lippert again and he's chased along a 30 and down he goes you know talking about the intensity of the man Woody Hayes if you look at him on the sidelines he's still walking up and down he wants to touch down it's a matter of personal try this game is Woody Hayes his life and he's brought so much to it really there he is Ohio State football has just been a tradition of great great things the executive producer of the Rose Bowl game Scotty Connell game has been produced by a car by there's the throw incomplete directed by Harry Coyle our associate producer has been Jim Maroney production managers Bill palmerston technical supervisor jerry Ireland and the technical director of the genes for bears your time remaining 42 to 10 USC statistics today there's the famous dog called Turk that's the mascot whose dog is that feed Adams the TV down he goes out and gets in these atoms is an orphan and that dog is also an orphan he picked him up off the streets and he just hangs around his flight all the time in a locker room he finally made it in the Rose Bowl they loved that dog with that USCG leopard running it to the 25 one minute to play in this game statistics today that you've been seeing big hole identify junk Estanza dr5 wood lobbying group responded you will see for first charles the years he's done a great job broadcast in the Ohio State Games when our spotter scoring Chuck Fatima and our production stage manager Carl McCarthy and they have voted a player of the game now what would you guess is a player of the game ladies and gentlemen can I try Anthony Davis you said Anthony Davis try again I give up Sam Cunningham that's one of the Helms Athletic Foundation player of the game award that has to give some strong consideration to Mike Ray the quarterback I agree Mike Ray what are his final figures there Joel Mike Ray really opened him up as the engineer at a brilliant attack here in the second half ray it 18 out of 25 for 229 yards and just directed a very brilliant tactic if 72 percent of his passes the mouse a still banging up the middle trailing 40 to defend well you can't really blame him what he did that and earlier when he decided to go to the air he was intercepted and that kind of just flew it all together up there he is still figured what he loves football here the lineup for you Johnny Carson Isaac Hayes Joey Heatherton Bob Hope Dean Martin Lee Trevino and Flip Wilson all part of the first Jack Finney special Thursday night January 18 right here on NBC let's those got in the Ohio State lineup with a timeout well McCain will leave the field with his squad 12 victories in a row this year the closest game he had was by nine points to Stanford and he's had a season that very few coaches have enjoyed the way he's dominated the opposition I mean it has been almost overpowering this season against the opposition a ninepoint game of the closest scare they had otherwise they just blasted everybody and it has to be I imagine l1 a powerhouse safety has ever come from the west coast that's right currently do you think what they did the class they showed against Notre Dame Notre Dame came up against them guts within two points and then USC pulled away and Steve Morrison throws its murder the tight end who goes out of bounds with 47 seconds there has to be a little bit of concern in the big ten how also about the Rose Bowl game because the PAC eight is winning his fourth in a row USC beat Michigan three years ago and Stanford jump undefeated Ohio State Stanford upset undefeated Michigan last year and now today USC is winning impressively in the 50s the early 60s the Big Ten with a dominant conference but now especially with a red shirting in effect here where Flair can be in school five years the Big Ten will not do that hurting them son and football quality they have to be a little bit concerned about this West Coast football and there goes a touchdown in short God bless those scores 44 seconds to go make the score 42 to 16 USC Paradis what's all really never quite came back from a an injury last year looks pretty good here though moving rather well Woody Hayes in his tradition kept calling the plays and went in for that score Blair Conway boots it up and good 4217 USC marker down offside against USC the client by Ohio State I know how they will kick off well far today dick look of this commissioner and the guidance Department official walk Indiana High School our headlines with Tom Frost from Tacoma Washington as a recreation director of the coma line judge Bob Fallon of dolt Illinois is a safety superintendent but the Illinois I fell telephone cut came back just Jake light of Roseburg Oregon independent insurance agent he's been officiating 23 years and the field judge Bob brought backup Peoria Illinois has admitted a West sales company executive nine years in the big ten six that's what officials today handling this game will kick off being a rarity today a woody hey Steen beaten this decisively yes don't run over his clubs like this USC has today I think the officials going for a fair catch waiting in the darkness now he's ready and they try an onside kick that goes about a loss of three or four yards and it is to go out of bounds we can't see with the flares on the sidelines and there is a new record for the shortest kickoff in history roll out of bounds on the 40 and the ball was kicked from the 45 so that is a net kickoff of 5 yard do you ever see that 1l and all I have to admit mr. Gary that's the first remember the Senior Bowl on NBC Saturday January 6th the outstanding seniors in American collegiate football I'm Akay just that I've never seen that either a kickoff from minus five yard and Southern Cal now is called timeout 42 to 17 USC called Pat Haden over and at South team the Senior Bowl game allamerican birch Jones of LSU Florida State's Gary Huff leading the north to the country's third leading passer Tony Adams of Utah State and the West Coast and out Oregon's Dan Fouts was father with an outstanding sports broadcaster 5/5 for years in the Bay Area by the way that was Kip husband that was walking one of the coaches of USC that walked in front of John McCain all the coaches are both teams have been extremely helpful to us all week first down USC at the 40 Pat Haden is the handoff Alan Carter a thirdstring tailback Mike Scannell made the tackle and we're down as you can see the last 30 seconds as USC has trampled they used to call in the Thundering Herd here under Howard Jones to coach five Rose Bowl teams John McKay is surpassing now with six Rose Bowl team and this has been the Thundering Herd today 42 points they've scored on an Ohio State squad that lost only one game and at limited block position of the 12 points the game the crowd fours out the salute America's number one college team it's all over a final sword UFC 42 Ohio State 17 it was closed at halftime 77 a tough battle in the first half in the passing game of USC their speed their variety and off and drop it open and they won going away a Happy New Year again ladies and gentlemen Curt Gowdy and now the oil gotta say late now for the Orange Bowl right after station identification James Coburn answers the question what did you do in the war that a Saturday at 9:00 8:00 central time you",

straight drop back we just ran where he throws on the run and heaves it out of power Lord Peis it all has a rush on and he's back in their allamerican tackle Haven Hall pressured him now watch him on this rush see that right arm Kurd that was what was bothering him it's wrapped up it's a bruising thing knows he's keeping that right arm out of there so it must be punishing him a little bit Thanks graph straight up he got graph ray has tossed five times ten times completed five for 58 yards third and 10 USC under 38 there's a rush again and he history site is young we made a great play out of that one and he was a safety valve man and I'll tell you that was dangerous when he flipped that fall out the young there close to the first down but not quite there there a yard away Parker comes in the punters in there Dave Boulware hits fourth down and a yard to go southern cow on her own 46 they're going into a punt formation Tim Holy Cross going back to the deep safety man for Ohio State wobbles this one up and Ohio State will have the ball deep in their own territory see they touched that ball back on the 13 so while the house they gets ready to go now well cause with a score oh hi Oh state seven USC seven your battery is pulled by the headlights drained by the radio weakened by the wipers dragged by the heater and air conditioner but starting rains more than all the others put together that's why Goodyear packs the powerhouse battery with more reserve power than the five best selling batteries when those other batteries give up and die Goodyear calls up the reserves

yards in the ground as USC in his game 104 255 leading rushers freshman Archie Griffin a 59yard fullback brandy Keith has the old Ohio State three yards and a cloud of green dust down here in the Rose Bowl to the 17 yard line of Ohio State second down thick you know they're coming but there's not much you can do about it well you know curtain until there is a train change really in defensive strategy what are you gonna stay with it he's gonna work on that five work on the man over the center Monty Davis is back in there a lot of pressure on the two line back insulin comes back in a fullback also a wide receiver Bradshaw is in they give the ball the Herald's champ Simpson who works on the family farm in Nashville Ohio during the summer he's over he's 22 he's 21 take him down there by James Sims I would have third down and along two to go for Ohio State our game is tied seven to seven eleven thirty to play in the first half bran to keep back in a fullback third down and two stop Archie Griffin stops on his 23 yard line by Richard wood the sophomore linebacker and the wind is swirling up again very strong now gusting around 2530 miles an hour I'll have a timeout for a measurement I just like to remind you that NBC's coverage of the National Hockey League action will continue next Sunday January 7th with a game between the Boston Bruins and the Chicago Blackhawks at 3 o'clock Eastern Time right here on NBC Perry Justin set that defense they're looking at this measurement they'll be punting agenda set that defense again it's a very wide 5 with Richard wood and Charles Anthony going on the outside shoulder of the middle van on the center what he Hayes the strategy is attack the 5 in a straight line they're doing rather well with it all right let's set up the punting Gary legal and platform ation Vince one he's in trouble hey got it away and bounding around at UFC territory and winds up on the USC 45 house after getting out of trouble first on us see on her own 45 yard line 32 yards front from scrimmage and you know curbing annex High School Center I know that it's kind of tough making that snap and I imagine if you're a sophomore as see Luke is in the Rose Bowl game it must be really tough USC has been out gained in this game so far they're tied 7 to 7 or at least the two touchdown favorite they're under 45 yardline there's the option the Davis is up to the 50 and he's pulled off down in Ohio State 46 yard line by van decree the wide defensive end so that gives us see a second down in the yard to go we got a chance carry that night you try to get a good shot of it Charles cut Charles Anthony but Sam Cunningham Sam BAM Cunningham number 39 for a big man he's a great speech and he's a devastating blocker Dave ball where and as a wide receiver he'll be a slot back Lynn Swann is out the desperate garrison was flanked outside of him second down a yard to go and get down to pass on the three and arnoldjones the blitzing linebackers Jones and what a charge Dupree has had today when he does Curt moving very well Hazen all coming with him Pete Adams retreating now it gets difficult Pete has a feeling he's doing what he's supposed to do but when that quarterback comes out of that pocket it gets awfully tough big lon loss of 17 it's third down and 18 ago they had 2nd and 1 and Ohio State smelled a pass all the way gone back in its life at third down long yardie they swing it out Anthony Davis gets away at the 35 and pumps out a found on the Southern Cal 41 but now it's fourth down and 14 to go go on third down the temple a USC has tried five and has failed to convert one so how states has five first out third down situations and they have converted one fourth down confirmation Dave ball where Jim Holy Cross back of the safety man along with Doug plank number 28 nine minutes to play and a half it's tight 77 the low kick rod feels it on he's 23 to the 25 and slithers true nearly got away number 77 feet Adams what this point Kurt the Ohio State team is definitely out playing us see now USC is armed tackling they're really not coming their offensive line isn't blowing off the ball sorry all right we'll get back to that L we're going to have a timeout now here in the Rose Bowl just under nine minutes the play and a half and a score USC seven ohio state seven I'm Bill Russell in business as in basketball you have to block the other guys shot to get a hit and then again there are instances when you have to be at both ends the core at the same time I found a way to handle that to say I'm in New York and after school points with a guy in the West Coast I do it by long distance I can talk to the guy feel him out see where it's coming from he could do the same you know that way we can reach an understanding in no time at all it's a fact long distance is the next best thing to being there so get with the businessman of course the point stays away oh hi Oh state's ball first down under 23 yard line they hold the edge and statistics so far is upset at his 24 yard line and he was dumped by Charles Phillips the cornerback at number 83 Richard Batman would second down 9 USC been behind only a couple of times all year early against Arkansas and early in a game against Illinois aside from that they have been ahead of their opponents all the way and they have been a tremendous third and fourth quarter team this year they've blown everybody out of the ballpark in the second half second down nine I'll stay sticking on the ground except one shall oppose the wing back james sims tackled him and Phillips third down and three let's check the rushing figures or both teams USC was expected to run on Ohio State today but in rushing I laughed at it up there down really go here's the option Griffin plan to slip outside you saw those quick feet it goes out of bounds on he's 35 and he has the first down for Ohio State Archie Griffin sure we had to keep in mind the only game again that Ohio State lost this year they were out rushed Michigan State got more yards than they did so far today Ohio State is out rushing a pretty good a very good USC defensive team and and al this freshman Griffin now against the number one ranked team in the country has 67 yards in the first half alone first down Ohio State under 35 fullback Keith jamming ahead to the 38 he's playing much more than everybody thought he would be today a three yard gain second down seven the hopes for Ohio State they said don't get behind early and be able to move the ball some to control the clock and that's what's happening now we've talked about Sims who's number 41 85 also Dale Mitchell runs real well he's got the wide side of the field to Tim's rather has the wide side of the field second down seven for the I've of Ohio State under 38 players given off the sheets again each to the 41 yard line Ohio State tackled by Monte Doris the middle guard of the Trojans will help there from Jorge Velez we're seeing what they're trying to attack which word is coming in colette is now in it right defensive tackle Monte Doris is in over the Senate a USC must stop that inside play that's been hurting them all afternoon Terrell Hinson replaces keep the fullback Ohio State's attempted only two passes third and four 41 we'll pull down on his 44 yard line by James Sims again number 41 while they're really popping in there again you see Luke going off the ball trying to block on money darvis Charles Anthony moving to the play he stopped in their sin it's not too big but very quick Gary Lego goes into a punt formation centering the ball back would be Tom Nixon now they had a bad snap the last time fairly good one and he kicks the low end to Lynn Swann in the 20 to 1 at the 25 21 by Tom Nixon who centered the ball back allow the lineup we pause briefly for station identification this is the NBC television network Kurt Goudy and Audi regatta the Rose Bowl an alltime record crowd of over a hundred and four thousand a sunny day temperature in the 60s and a gusty wind blowing and the game now settle into a defensive duel between the two 30yard line 534 to play in the first half of 77 gray on the option the Davis Davis at the 25 the 30 on a 48yard line of USC bike seat kissing and arnoldjones well I think AG is great my wife's number 39 needs to play when you're as fast as that man is he wipes out he'll call Z over there Arnold Jones comes over strong man that's a sign of great balance they say he's got excellent eyes Kirti really can see that defense extremely well Anthony Davis just left the game after this 27 yard run he now has 86 yards in the first half Anthony Davis replaced by McNeill and Sam BAM Cunningham frantically up the middle stopped cold by Pete juicy this is something that'll stop cold bye Pete juicy this is some site here in this valley football game to see a freshman Griffin with over 60 yards in the first half and a sophomore Anthony Davis with over 80 yards on the ground now Davis is back into the game replacing rod McNeil his brother plays that you at UCLA and they live together second down USC on their 49 yard line they have a second down nine they've been tied 7 to 7 so far Tenley's not against USC and a flag was dropped back in the backfield of USC they may have moved out and I think Oprah seizure we were talking about his eyes and there was an indication of it he's got great body balance excellent ID so he's always looking at that second way this fish young man is tremendous balance we already said the penalty was for a legal procedure so the ball is back now in the 44 yard line of Southern Cal the second down 14 to go and that wiped out the long gain in the first down game tied 7 2 7 4 minutes 10 seconds to play in the half Davison's cunningham behind ray gray Blair's adoptive Davis at the 40 animate his moves and get it back to the 46 Charles V crop the secondstring tackle on him there now it's third down and 12 yards to go for USC the state team looks like they're using a 43 it's a little different type of 43 we indicated early they're playing their interior for rather wide two linebackers in the middle they're dropping the zone pretty good giving you short passes really to the outside my crazed hit 8 out of 13 for 72yard he's presented now with a third and 12 deep drop back now to scramble and that pass is a complete nobody signaled yet it must be Sam cunningham caught the ball at the diving grab with Randy Gradishar right there with him but they don't have enough for the first down and this Ohio State team is playing very well against the pass out they really aren't there's that defensive front just tremendously impressed with them you like the way they're moving across they're losing their hands extremely well and they're always going after Dave ball we're back in punt formation again Tim Holy Cross will be the deep safety ball where has a strong wind at his back but sometimes it's a crosswind and he tries this one hi Andy data back when it's a touchback it was in the end zone get the such fact when IO space ball first now sable put the ball in play first down on her own 20yard line they're arguing Kurtis didn't bounce in but it was into the end zone definitely all right we have a timeout with the score ohio state 7 and USC 7 this is the newest copier in the IBM line aside from sharp clear copies of ordinary jobs this plain paper copier makes sharp clear copies of books sharp clear copies of oversized documents even sharp clear copies of photographs and it lets you make them fast the more you want from a copier the more we think you'll appreciate this one the new copier from IBM is tomorrow the morning you break an old habit when you start to think what good are two edges if you can only shave when wanted she puts both edges on your side the Schick super tools super chromium edges working together for a close comfortable shave the Scheck super it's enough to make you break an old habit the fall fast just before the goal line they're trying to reach up now they call US illegally fating is a touchback Ohio State fall under 20 yard line game tied 7 to 7 to 19 to play in the first half rich job also has been effective every time he's Jerry Duvall is brought down by the weak side linebacker Charles Anthony tackles today gran is made for Simms is 5 woods 5 and Phillips 3 for USC they're on defense right now yeah both carry the ball just four times an average of 9 and a half yards for 38 yards hit a second down three to go Ohio State on their own 27 they have fought USD to a standstill they run the fullback landok East to the 30 Ohio State now has gained 144 yards on the ground the 92 for Southern Cal States first down the stops the clock for the 936 to play in the half we've been talking about the offensive center Luke but next to him is Chuck Bonica number 58 an outstanding Big Ten Player an outstanding several allamerican mentions and also Steve kragle number 63 on the left side good jars we all stand by Woody Hayes offense plugging away up the middle that's what they've been doing today down in a counter play Griffin is hit hard at the 34yard line they put the ball in the air just flies they haven't run much trick stuff tonight right after this game Nebraska against Notre Dame that'll be on NBC from the Orange Bowl in Miami Nebraska Notre Dame the Orange Bowl we have 56 seconds to play in the half second of six for Ohio State he's throwing a wobbly pass after the 50 I think he was undecided he was trying to hit the tight end Brett puckish down deep he was really trying to go after Bradshaw but he saw he was covered and then he changed his mind right in the middle of his delivery and that's why the pass went out there got a halfheartedly and fell to the turf in complete right they've gotten out there at the five defensive backs Richard wood is off on the far sideline he is out you see him standing there with coach John Mackay they're going to try to take away the pass number one and number three ranked teams meeting here in this game they're down a 63 Ohio State the 37 and that's all Archie Griffin met fair by ten Gray's number 37 a sophomore linebacker in San Pedro California hey timeout Southern Cal is call the time they have one left now in this half 37 seconds remaining and it'll be fourth down Gary Lego has come on to do the pudding Tom Nixon will Center the ball really interesting Kurt the way this wind suddenly calms down just completely there isn't a breeze right now which obviously be very helpful to number 22 Lynn Swann will be catching his punt shadows are starting to creep up from the near side well Ohio State has played themselves some football game here in the first half they fell behind seven nothing they had an early Drive stopped on the 20yard line of Southern Cal and Ohio State came back in eight plays went 56 yards for the score they've out gained USC they stopped him on big passing plays and they've been plugging away they'll see what happens now in his fourth down kick Lynn Swann was average 14 yards a punt return his deep for the project he's the single safety very dangerous man laughter and and he just got it away the kicker went down and he's claiming that he was rough Dale Mitchell let's watch it now on a rerun is he hip he'll take a look he went for that foot pretty good turns this is the way you've tried to block a kick good call they missed him he went right fine pretty good act though fine at USC and UCLA I have very good dramatic schools I'd say Legos in there Rohan school it'll be a first down for USC on there 41 but he did quite a job getting rid of that kick 31 seconds to go into half let's see how USC plays it now it's a tie game 7 to 7 ray starts the options spins it out to Davis Davis votes for the sideline and was out of bound and decree who's been outstanding as a defensive end the day for Ohio State we've run with excellent lateral pursuit ran Anthony Davis out 26 seconds to go in the half and here the penalty being marched off against USC USC has not been able to get on track much here in this first half remember one drive that's a clipping penalty against USC carry their ball back to the 28 yard line and makes it first and 25 you know it's interesting the talented linebackers that we have been seeing all year particularly today Randy Gradishar very good Arnold Jones unheralded but good Rick Middleton could be a surprise this boy could be outstanding first down now long yardage 20 seconds to 6 seconds ago and a half graves on the fraud and it's at the 40yard line the Charles young is tied in he's shackled on the 46th of the USC so that is the second reception for Charles young UNC is call a timeout and that's all the time outs they have now they're in the first half 18 seconds remaining well we do that the sophomore Anthony Davis was good but al he is averaged just a little better than seven yards a carry 86 yards in the first half you know what's incredible Kurt he's 18 as you say he is a freshman but being able to read that offensive blocking as well as he does now this is a trade really of Woody Hayes he said you could drill a team doll or you can drill it sharp well he's drilled this team sharp and that young man watches the blocks extremely well and has a great burst it'll be a second down and about four to go coming on now is Manfred more a play being sent in Manford more pull back Mike raise coming back to the huddle Sam Cunningham goes out 18 seconds for Southern Cal undefeated in their last 16 games their closest game this year has been by nine points against Stanford they had one of the most impressive point spreads over their opponents in recent years in college football and they've been tied today played to a standstill seven to seven here at the end of the first half 11 wins in a row sorely pressed today he has Fred my way gets out of that past run broken pattern maybe at the 40yard line mr. Charlie young at 33 and a fumble their fumble the ball coming up when there's duck plank number 28 you're only five seconds to go made an excellent move Kurt was a good hit he really popped him and he did fumble it's better like this boy we continued to get my gray it was in real trouble here a passing plane that's the All American tied in young now watch him here Jeff Davis hit seen Davis is out when has big tight end hit him and on the fumble duck flank came up with it so in the last five seconds of the half of the Ohio State's fall the 1973 Rose ballgame with a score oh hi oh space 7 USC 70 when headache pain and the tension it can build bring out the worst in you take Edison watch Anacin starts with as much pain reliever as the leading aspirin tablet then adds an extra core of this specific ingredient against pain her headaches gone and so is its tension anderson relieves headache pain and so it's tension Addison no it's convertible let me three cars in one like this see this is

this 1973 Rose Bowl game is brought to you by your chryslerplymouth dealer highlighting Plymouth Satellite for 1973 and by Goodyear makers of the new custom steel guard radio silence and by Texaco and the many thousands the USC fan we're here halftime of the Rose Bowl and our game is tied 77 one of the most important parts of any song is the lyrics many of today's popular tunes carry social messages through their lyrics for an example you only need to tune in to your radio and listen to Chicago's latest rockin dialogue visual medium of television music both creates and heightened emotions to enhance what you see sit back relax and listen while the Trojan marching band dances the Isaac Hayes's theme from the moon music and movies go hand in hand many movies have been based on the lives of famous musical personalities the hottest movie in America today is Lady Sings the Blues based on the life of jazz singer Billie Holiday and now to sing love is here to stay from that movie the Trojan marching band proudly presents its star miss Diana Ross not for whatever and may be handsome panties may go go in alone no way that we know makes you see fencing fantasy but in time the USC fan the scores Ohio State seven USC seven as we get ready for the second half kickoff in the 1973 Rose Bowl game I'm John Brodie this is the most exciting radial tire of its time the new Goodyear custom steel guard radio a forty thousand mile tire with five guards to help protect you five ways in my business I know all about great protection it's not as good here in there the steel guard radial helps you get great protection look at this giant model it's the radio that helps guard against rough ride against penetration under the tread against wet skids against loss of road contact and against sluggish handling I couldn't ask for any better protection myself great protection for great control that's what you get with a steel guard radio the confidence of control and that's the five guard feeling only from good here very even as you can see yards rushing Ohio State has double the yards on the ground at USC which is a surprise no surprise that USC has dominated in passing because they've thrown the ball 16 times to this three for Ohio State interesting duel between Anthony Davis he has 75 86 yards on the ground his team has 75 also but Anthony Davis has 86 16 yard loss to Mike Ray is what threw him back 15 carries 73 yards for RIT Griffin Archie is averaging four point nine in cabbage carry seven point two for Anthony Davis that play a dual the receiving in has been passing to mostly short passes the Charlie young Anthony Davis is Lynn Swann 16 thrown 11 completed by Ray three thrown one completed by Gregg hair I had a 77 Kurt Goudy and LD rogue on us as we head into the second half ana see now if us he opens up the 14 and a half point favorites have been held to the tie and here's a cross kick at shortland Cunningham offended at the 44 but that short kick is USC excellent field position Kevin Fletcher making the tackle first down for Southern Cal on their 43 yard line Mike Ray will be the quarterback again carried only twice or year both of these teams been tied at halftime USC tied by Arkansas three three and nothing nothing in the rain against Oregon Anthony Davis and Sam Cunningham behind race one is going in motion the pitches to Davis Davis spilled out of bound on his 47 yard line by George Hazen Hall number 70 the left tackle they'll have Hazen Hall and shoe streak of the to tackle 70 and 71 decree playing the white side of the field is defensive in he's been outstanding and cope is the short side of the field in number 91 Middleton Gradishar Jones and flanked the four men right in back of that front for Tim Fox rich Parsons and Jeff Davis of the deep man second down six there Ron Davis and he has slowed up that time he was hit first by shad Williams number 79 and then sealing it off with number 42 Arnold Jones Falls now on the 48 yard line of Southern Cal they have a third and five and put more than a fullback replacing Sam Cunningham the wind is in favor of Ohio State here in the third quarter gusty windy day here waves lapping throwing to the sidelines completing at the limbs blonde and he's just out of bounds on the Ohio State 41 you saw an interesting defensive moved there when Lanford Moore went into the game that meant paced the Ohio State Ohio in with a threeman rush the two outside many of you saw one of their drops off a threeman rush the linebackers tried to take away the outside throw Swan is toddies third fast cutting hands back in a fullback now Jake a McKay and Lynn Swann or wide to the left USC has been able to move much in the ground and the air has been different North Sound in the 35 yardline it broke Hazen Hall's tackle first finally was Doug plank that nailed his top five and Acree here it is again this boy is not only got speed but he's got power that Gradishar he's big and he is strong pulls away from Gradishar this is the pursuit now that helps out the outside pursuit is really what makes it Anthony Davis tops off for the pack aid car but now it's picked up 96 yards on the ground Manford more the place then there again a fullback the option play what if charge like radish our hoop lips Randy Gradishar flipping four or five times they really put ray under the pressure today with tremendous charges you're right Kari they've got this team figured out extremely well you saw the good play by the halfback coming up going under it that was playing Gradishar comes up and wipes it away a third down and 17 USC on the Ohio State 48 the game is tied 7 to 7 early in the second half ray fires deep this one he has perfectly at the 25 Hugh's a great thrill though I'm I crave the threat for his whim you know card rate been coming out of that talk it in the first half this time he stayed in it gave his team time to protect and laid it right there perfectly blank knocks Aneta back 13 out of 18 from I crave who didn't even place in the first or second allconference team well it won the Pop Warner Award is the most valuable player in the pack eight timers how do you figure that one out on first down way again guideline found it with the Jays game McCain McKay and a few SC in the air now ticking Ohio State apart okay you'll notice that fool man to mustache the coach the Sun and the long hair great human interest story the father and the son together now at USC 50 colleges tried to recruit McKay D in Pat Hayden will be the quarterback for USC next year one of the outstanding passing combinations in the history of California high school circles and Hayden lived in the coach's home you know in their senior year because McKay's are Hayden's parents had moved to San Francisco and young McKay and Hayden did not want to be separated I want to finish the senior year together area was kind of interesting when John was telling us that he would go upstairs and he knew those coaches and Scouts were downstairs talking his son and he wanted young JK to make his own decision and that's the kind of man John McKay is and they attacked the first a foul on now half the distance to the goal against Southern Cal the ball on the ohio state six yard line with a first and six to go that's the first ohio state penalty in the game raised under the gun breaking away throws it out of the end zone he just threw it away Garrett back at the 20yard line with pqz who has had some past rushes today and shad Williams imagine my Crais has had more pressure today even though he's been very effective he's hit 14 out of 20 now several times he's had to throw four apply for out in the Cotton Bowl 1713 Texas overall a man more in betting Amazon at fullback Ashton the Davis Davis heading to the flag bounds on the to Arnold Jones drove him out the linebacker third down and two to go for a USC touchdown how many times is the highest 18 curt held against that great Michigan team and here they are again back to the wall and they're responding just beautiful I think they held 12 times inside their 10 in that game wall plays they're going to measure for the first down the USC gaining only 55 yards on the ground in the first half came with a passing game and opened up here at the beginning of the second half they're short the r6 that still not cleared the field Anthony Davis was out BAM Cunningham is in along with manse with more they have their two big fullback then put the power down at the goal line in Ohio State has four defensive tackles in there down here at the two yardline now digging in there's a guy with his famous hurtling died but he Leslie out in front there won't be many people that will stop him when he gets in the air Sam I guess that's where he gets the BAM shutting him Cunningham who has been timed in ten yards by the USC track cult burn wolf as the fastest he's ever timed the USC athlete after that a little different story but he could get to that line of scrimmage very quickly Mike raise extra point except his good drive by us me mostly fine passing time out in the store now the USD 14 oh hi Austin so you found a new friend your moody stuff well that's okay in this car is enough let us face dusty you get a full down seat here in the back gives you 6 and 1/2 feet of space to pack whatever you gotta pack in the back full a carpeted deep folds up to where the rooms it opens on a country ride don't cost much extra that's a Sun inside crank shut nice and tight because the Sun don't shine very much good night of course everybody knows that lemon face duster you can get more out of it because you can get more into it duster next to care and engineering it makes the difference the u.s. sees drive 57 yards in ten blade they're out in front 14 to 7 now house they'll get the ball for the first time in his half Davis's chick is very short Randy Keith takes it down to 23 and he has hit there at his own 30 to tackle by number 48 of us see an earthquake has occurred as you all know in Nicaragua many thousands of families homeless if you care to help send your dollars to care Nicaragua earthquake fund Department to New York New York 116 how about the shocking news Roberto Clemente the great one the greatest baseball players of all time lost evidently killed in a plane crash on the way to help give relief to those who needed Nicaragua actually Griffin down at the 31 yard line he's given us some outstanding thrills on the NBC game of the week and over the years valuable player four times batting said what a World Series he had in 1971 and the Governor of Puerto Rico has announced a free day mourning period for Roberto Clemente lost and evidently killed on his way to Nicaragua to help in relief of the victims there that's the Ohio State bench you notice in drinking water there we want to talk about that in a moment there's Griffith and he's hit at the 23 USC now evidently fought hey they must have been given some kind of talk at halftime by John McCabe you know to sell the Ohio State players drinking water their team doctor Robert Murphy especially asked us to talk to the high school college coaches around tomorrow about the lack of teams drinking water now that 8/5 last year heat strokes lack of water and heat flames at a dehydrated player is a fourth performer and more athletes to drink water they can drink all they want Joost the pass has got a man wide open and he kisses the ball at the USC 45 as Tim holocron and you oh hi oh state now had the first down on the USC 45 we've seen a switch of strategy on the part of southern cow and that was to go to the air and they did it very well highest state now put their ball to put the ball on the ground it looked like USC made an adjustment to take away the inside and perhaps weaken themselves up defensively against the fast stop the run Tim Holy Cross catches a good pass USC is leading 14 to 7 Ohio State's ball is a Southern Cal 45 mandeecees breaks 4:30 5:30 and pounds his way to the USC 27 gave him the defensive end bought him down another old house a first down here it is again that centers doing a fine job Monty Dory's tries to make the move good block to put we're on Richard wood Randy Keith well he's going to find good locker probably a better blocker than championship and wood is out Richard wood the sophomore brilliant linebacker it was an 18yard gallop by Randy Keith Ohio State in the Southern Cal 27 first down notice jeez hit they keep moving on his face low center of gravity very difficult a knockdown boy you're going to see a good home barefoot blocking this lock to the inside key theme to play out this man has brilliant instant really great instinct now this is the second time my estate has responded when USC is scored and they're in great scoring position now I've never seen to better a young running back to one game and Griffin a freshman and Davis a sophomore first down he spotted a ball at the 11th that he went down Randy Keith gets a shuffle and a set when he was met head on there by the nose guard of US v Monte Doris on the 9 yard line of the Trojan second down eight to go

boy was in a bit earlier and he does a good job he also is very quick and a full house key for making this one weighs 185 is stronger though when you're thinking would be he can get him inside and outside auntie Doris again brought him down along with Jeff widened the right tackle number 92 it's on the six yard line of Southern Cal third down and five for a first Griffin in high school in Columbus Ohio was a wrestling champion third and five for Ohio State inside believe in the more difficult now when they go inside four yards up down there against the mass goal line defense Parker

already left the parade some even stayed overnight to see the parade in the Rose Bowl games left on the streets and today an alltime record roller brawl crowd of over a hundred and four thousand will watch Ohio State play USC as NBC Sports presents they look at the 1973 Rose Bowl game here we are the Rose Bowl game it's the granddaddy of them all a Happy New Year from Curt Goudy and LD real got it you know Alan was just fifty years ago in the first Rose Bowl stadium game that the Trojans beat Penn State by a score of 14 to 3 however the fart very first game was played back in nineteen 270 years ago that point a minute powerhouse from the University of Michigan came out to play Stanford well the game was a rout Michigan won the game by a score of 49 to nothing the game was so onesided and so boring that the tournament committee decided that football wasn't the answer for their special day and so is scheduled some other event let's take a look so on New Year's Day in 1930 the theme was simply an afternoon as foreign and a varied menu of competition it was everything from track and field a greased pole climbing egg and spoon races but soon to become the most popular event was chariot racing and so it was for the next 14 years charioteers is fired by the popularity of the book Ben Hur that was sweeping the country rushed their very lives and limbs meantime the new year's a morning to track the Rose Parade which had begun as early as 1890 maintained its popularity and it was enjoyed not only by spectators but also by those parade participants who relish the challenge of creating unusual eye catching floral design finally in 1916 football was given a second chance the popularity the Rose Parade was undampening this scene from the 1916 parade originality and design continued to flourish even in the rain hello Washington state shutout Brown University 14 to nothing on January 1st of that year the game with the crowdpleaser and even a downpour in Chile 46 degree temperature cannot dampen the spirits of those who realize that football in Pasadena was here to stay within just six years plans were finalized to build the concrete stadium and on February 7th 1922 construction began on what eventually was to become the worldfamous Rose Bowl so named by Tournament of Roses publicity man Harlan dusty Hall despite somewhat primitive construction equipment and method less than a year later saw the Rose Bowl opened its gates for the first time to a capacity crowd of 57,000 on that historic day for the City of Pasadena January 1st 1923 well rain in that first game played in the Rose Bowl stadium today the weather is very windy it's going to be a factor in this game we'll be talking about it later an LD roll goddess is going to carry you along but some of the highlights of the Ohio State season right after this you guys can see magnets up close I decided to give you a purse snatched area trial out of uniform but on Judy read and Malloy royal a purse snatching back in

on me alone and there is no escape your God and this island I am watch search Wednesday at 10/9 central time on NBC Ohio State is number three in the country they're nine and one some say this team is three yards and a cloud of dust we think otherwise and I think you'll agree Woody Hayes is completing his 22nd season at Ohio State and his teams of one three or four in the Rose Bowl the Buckeyes have a big quarterback in Junior Greg head she's 63 and 198 pounds average nearly four yards a carry this pair is from Cumberland Maryland scored 40 days hair is a strong arm has completed 49 percent of his passes to score three for touchdown tenth a creek gallows was the leading pass receiver for Ohio State catching 11 top more fullback Harrell champ ensign led the nation in scoring with 20 touchdowns the 64 220 eight pounder from Nashville Ohio gained over a hundred yards in four different games and finished with 772 yards rushing freshman Archie Griffin also gained 772 on the ground to Ty Henson for the school leadership Griffin gained 239 yards in his first game against North Carolina defense is a Woody Hayes trademark and against Michigan the Buckeyes allowed a store and only one of 12 plays inside the 5yard line tackle George Hayden all number seven the defensive captain of the Ohio State squad the teammates who voted him the Most Valuable Player of the Year and the 262 pounder from Garfield Heights Ohio has made the first unit on several allamerican teams Hayes and oil is a natural leader when he was in high school he served as captain of football wrestling and attracted another Ohio State allamerican is number 53 Randy Gradishar he plays what is coaches called the short linebacker position but Gradishar is hardly that a 63 and weighs 238 pounds Gradishar missed nearly three games this fall because of the knee injury and still finished second on set in tackles well have to look at the Ohio State highlights we'll take a look at now what happened for us see during your undefeated season right after this messy is it possible with this planet for it has been visited by travelers from outer space did they wander through the throbbing lightyears of the universe in search of other life and find it here if we accept the premise that beings from another civilization visited here ages ago then some of the mysteries of our past take on a new and startling light early stone carvers left sign of the records for their descendants to tell us something but not quite enough the world is a storehouse an archive of unexplained phenomena gigantic creations in effigy of what to appease or acclaim folk legend surrounds their origin strange stories of gods who appeared writing across the skies and flaming chariot of light Serling narrates a fascinating NBC special in search of ancient astronauts Friday at 10:00 9:00 Central Time John McKay is not a bashful man and he comes right out and says if this year's USC team is the best one he's ever caught 11 wins in a row let's watch some of their at the USC team to the Rose Bowl with a sixth time in 11 years he's won three and lost two at Pasadena the unbeaten Trojans feature a balanced offense they've gained nearly 2,000 yards passing with unanimous allamerican tied in Charles young grabbing 23 the case says young is the best tight end he's ever coached junior Lynn Swann not only caught 21 passes this year he averaged 11 and 1/2 yards per run on flanker reverses and led the Pacific Eight Conference in punt returns with a 14 yard average sophomore JK McKay the coach's son top stubborn Keller receptions with 25 forgoing four touchdowns fullback Sam BAM Cunningham scored nine touchdowns he was third in team rushing but the 218 pounds seniors noted for his crunching blocking Mike Ray is one of the most underrated quarterbacks in the country he passed for over 1,500 yards completing 55 percent of his posture he scored 97 points himself ray ran for almost 300 yards many times after scrambling free from tackler and the senior kicked the school record eight field goals and 43 extra points he won the Pop Warner Award as the most valuable player on the west coast for the first eight games this autumn Anthony Davis wasn't even a starter for the Trojan on December 2nd this 190 pound sophomore became an instant celebrity on that afternoon in the Coliseum he scored six touchdowns against Notre Dame two of those six pointers came on kickoff returns of 97 and 96 yards Davis finished the campaign with 1034 yards rushing the most in history by a USC sophomore his 16 touchdowns trail only henson of Ohio State not bad for a young man with a quarterback in high school it might become a pro baseball outfielder in two years in the background here from the Rose Bowl in Pasadena right after that I am just the young man who is coming home from war it's a hard ball I have traveled but soon these had served my country within the last hour the wind is diminished here at the Rose Bowl 30 to 50 miles an hour of blowing this morning they can still be gusting again what about the wind the factor in the game L move the ball so extremely well on the ground you have the fear that really it may not be that much of a factor we're a son of meter problem terribly the chosen frame the ball up will be difficult number one the trouble should be in field goals in just fielding kicks it was incredible the amount of trouble they were having with the duck what he Hayes says that USC has never really been tested this year they've never been behind he said we want to find out early and we can move out in front I think that'll be a real clue to this game it will house fake and get an early lead yes they don't have the buried offense the play catch up football right and Kurt they can move the ball better than most people think 9 &amp; 1 is a great record they can go up top the truth is Kurt they cannot afford to get behind absolutely right I believe the first lady has arrived this is Nixon he was in the parade she wrote in the parade this morning and this was Pat Nixon the first lady has arrived at the Rose Bowl will view the game here her husband spent a football morning he had as his guest for lunch this morning in the White House George Allen the coach of the Washington Redskins were going to be playing Miami in a Super Bowl game which would be seen on NBC the 14th of January he is now being announced to the crowd so mrs. Nixon takes her seat Ohio State USC are in their dressing rooms and we're going to have the parade of dignitaries here so that's been it for a free view look at the Rose Bowl game and we'll be right back following station identification for USC mrs. Nixon's USC and Ohio State in the 1973 Rose Bowl game who told me mrs. the Rose Bowl next followed by the Orange Bowl a football doubleheader on NBC the 1973 Rose Bowl game is brought to you by your dodge dealer we invite you to see the big guy and by Goodyear makers of the new rose custom fields art radial tire and by Texaco and many thousands of independent retailers and distributors in all 50 states hi everybody Kurt Goudy LD roll Gatos on behalf of NBC Sports wishing you a very happy new year and today John McKay against woody hate all week these two coaches have been asked a lot of questions mostly is this game for the national championship is this for the number one team in America what do you hate said it should be okay at first says no now I said let it go for that that's what Hayes wants he's in town that's what it's going to be but I think the one real question that should be asked for coaches and which we've done is how does it feel to play in the Rose Bowl as a player as a coach or players in future years and so first of all we went to woody hey white clear and ask him about the Rose Bowl this is our third time in five years it's quite a choice a lot of work but it's all worth it because we're not only regarding is the oldest of the ball games but the best friend we're certainly playing a super team this year in the Southern Cal they always represent this conference out here well we like to feel weakly the same sort of great thing in conference from which we come so it'll be a great football game we're the underdogs but the theme for coach Woody Hayes it has been at all his winning seasons is flared and it's same for John Mackay and USC okay though I think they look at different slant on it especially when he speaks on behalf of the pack a car of course the Rose Bowl is the goal of all teams in our conference and I think all the teams in a big 10 this university is appeared in 17 times I've been fortunate to appear five times it's my sixth time I can think of no greater thrill for a college coach or a college football player and plane in this game some of the great players of all time and played in it we're going to play a very very fine team in Ohio State and we think it's gonna be a great game and we hope they have a lot of fun thank you now coming on to the field the grand marshal Michael Morrison Wayne Duke Wayne the fireman nicknamed him when they used to keep his dog when he went to Glendale High School and a football player at USC and he's with Otis blasting ham the tournament president John Wayne a very popular choice is Grand Marshall 50 years ago he said he used to help pin up some of the flowers for the parade and it took him 50 years to decide to make him the grand marshal and here are the Queen's the queen of Sally Ann Lorne a 20 year old beauty from Altadena California and her princesses are Michelle Marie the Bedini Gayle Andrea Girl Melanie Lee Erland Janet J car Jimmie Lou Bates and Karen Lee so the Queen and her friends let's quickly talk about the weather the wind has died down it was gusting 30 to 50 miles an hour a wind coming off the heights of Utah down through Santa Ana and there was some danger that the wind would raise havoc with the freight agenda but you can see the trees the wind and once again out what is the strategy this winds going to be stronger at time today then it keeps gusting up and down that's right Kurt you know other than the wind the setting is this magnificent I've never seen weather like this frankly strategy faltered so much but not necessarily in any big way again the ball is going to be on the ground we may see some passing Ohio State hasn't been overwhelming whelmingly through the passing game in the past let's go down in the field now and pick up the Ohio State bat Ohio State now this alltime record crowd of over a hundred and four thousand will be on their feet temperature in the sixties the Ohio State man will be maneuvering and then we're going to have our national anthem and now to honor America you are invited to join The Ohio State University marching band under the direction of dr.

you're shake hands then get your kidneys right out here can we pause briefly for station identification this is the NBC television network Kurt Goudy and LD row goddess Ohio State in white Southern Cal is spreading out what he haze with a last talk let him go and the famous plussize battlecry playing in the background John McCabe seeking his 100th coaching victory today what he Hayes is going after his one hundred and fiftieth this afternoon it's unusual to see a tailback kick off but Anthony Davis the star running back of USC on the small side when you look at him is going to be kicking off he has a very strong leg and McKay says he's going to make him into the field goal kicker next year the boy doesn't want to do it but that's what it's going to be he's a superb athlete an excellent baseball player Archie Griffin is the middle man number 45 Bosch Nagel number 48 and Holy Cross 27 are deep the wind is swirling around you can't really tell from what direction is coming from here's the kick if the short one and running up on that when there's a freshman fashion taking on the 2025 down in the 28 yard line Ohio State will move into action now on their 28th Bollinger downfield for USD to make the hit Greg here will be the quarterback is number 18 Archie Griffin 45 Henson 38 Galvis 33 the running back during their robust here the old straight Dean hair on the option with hit by spoon Sims number 41 its jr. from Los Angeles and he practically plays in the opponent's backfield he's very quick and he Gamble's and penetrates in the play it's brewing back for two as to the 26 yard line of Ohio State second down well to go at Sims fella carry waste this year has been a defensive back for this Trojan team all right smartest checked in as a tight end now for Ohio State either for stringers twentyseven Monni doors who plays the nose guard of the middle guard in the five man went line for us he hit him the yard gain in the beasts third and 11 Dale Mitchell is the left in 85 they flop around a time John Grant the allamericans left tackle 94 doors the middle man 72 Jeff widens 90 to the right tackle and Sims 41 the end Holy Cross into the game smert has come out third and 11 and with this wind today passing may be treacherous Ohio State Grigg hair they run it again with the Gryphon when he spills over the 32 is 32 a gain of 5 but they're way short it'll be fourth down six To Go and coming in now the punt is Gary Lago who was a top kicker in the big 10 this year averaging 41 and a half yards a kick and he's going against the best punt return man on the west coast Lynn Swann number 22 so in one game this year ran punts back for 157 yards against Michigan State the best single game effort of the college season beautiful beautiful back to the 20th tumbled and it's out of bounds on the 15 and the ball was fumbled by hitman number 26 tell us see now spin back on their 15yard line we took we talked about that wind Kurt and we said it could be a factor in the punting game in practice they were having a difficult time it just rips away from you fortunate kick it's out of bounds that was a 53yard punt no return take that anytime wouldn't you beauty all right USC will have mike ray at quarterback number six out of their stack i anthony davis of the tailback 28 Cunningham's the fullback 39 s 1 is the flanker 22 Mike Ray's going in motion this one 16 yard line by Randy Gradishar number 53 of the allamerican linebacker second down nine to go the Dessel garrison number 19 is a split in the man who made everybody's allamerican Charles young 89 is the tight end Pete Adams Steve Riley at tackles Mike Ryan Allen graphic guards and Dave Brown as the center second down nine for USC no score two and a half minutes gone microwave from Lakewood California Anthony Davis again amazing balance Johnny McKay must have been asked a thousand times who does he run like garrison or Jarrett Hilary played Curt they were stacked to the inside Ohio State nicely Anthony Davis takes up to the outside follows his interference well that's quite a bit on his own and you know Alan you figure he didn't start until the eighth game I still wound up gaining 707 yards you know how incredible he had to be in the last three four games of the season for USC you know Curt also looking at the state defense they're playing they're two of their four linemen very wide Gradishar and Middleton the excellent linebackers are jamming that middle it looks like it's inviting for the Trojans it may not be the coach's son Jake came the K if he plays garrison as a wide receiver Bay will be number 25 in most of the strong David hits the point I'm assuming magnificent charger by number 88 then decree of 53 Gradishar the linebacker he sixfootthree he's 232 pounds he's a junior and he's the man really they've got to be 53 moving to the outside coming back quite a bit of help carried great pursuit Manfred more number 44 as come in is pull back now for USC you notice that time the raid a quarterback went back and gave the ball the Davis deep that's to give Davis and time to look over the situations to pick out his hole he sort of delays back there wanna motion again a flag down that's against USC illegal procedure and I believe he may have started the man emotion toward the line of scrimmage the 19 yard line of USC they have a second down and 16 we have no score 11 minutes to play in the first period we've been talking cared about those linebackers Rick Middleton number 32 generally plays the offside Gradishar plays the strong side tough there's Middleton very quick now this is their power I wanna motion McKay is flanked to the left great for a first pass the screen gave us out and down down his 30 yard line by Rick Middleton the wide linebacker number 32 Anthony Davis Cox 15 passes this year they have a buried attack McKay bought 25 Charlie young the tide in 23 121 Davis 15 so they have four or five outstanding targets to produce third down now for USC on your 30 yard line Cunningham is back in it pull back answer Moore's out there all the USC records at the sophomore set this year you're going to throw on third and five he can move he's under the gun he's one up desperately and this one is out of bounds but he was just throwing out of desperation he threw the big rainbow lob up there in the field of play that could have been intercepted how about this state defensive line Kurt now they're really penetrating we were tremendously impressed with the Trojans offensive front huge people very quick don't estimate underestimate this highest state defensive front they really come and Tim Holly crops who goes to Ohio State a sophomore at Bedford Heights OH Ohio is back as a safety man in punt formation will be Dave Boulware who averaged 35 and a half yards going against the wind kicks it low wobbles job if sent a 45 and he gets a few extra yards in the bounce and it winds up alright for us he is dead on the Ohio State 34 yard line we have a timeout now the Rose Bowl with a score USC nothing Ohio State nothing introducing the new Goodyear custom steel guard radio the 40,000 miles higher with five guard to protect you five ways guard 1 against rough ride a shock absorbing polyester cord body guard 2 against penetration under the tread to strong steel belts guard 3 against wet skids a computer design thread channels the water in wet weather against loss of road contact on curves to special other groups allow the trend and the scythe wall to work independently more firm tread contact guard 5 against sluggish handling special stabilizers stiff on the sidewalk and cuff allow recovery on sudden turns with a new Goodyear steel guard radial you get the 5 guard feeling the confidence of control only from Goodyear and Ohio State offense on the ground 270 yards this season as usual Ohio State ran the ball six times for every time they passed it a 6 to 1 ratio Ohio State under 34 they gained through yards in the exchange of punts right here Archie Griffin the freshman how about a freshman playing in the Rose Bowl game isn't that something hometown Columbus boy Archie Griffin picked his way to his 40yard line rich wood has great speed he almost overshoots the play here who's 9 8 imagine that a sophomore linebacker 18 9 800 he comes back great speed Elizabeth New Jersey Thomas Jefferson High School what a football clip they call him the fat man because he does miraculous things Ohio State on their 42nd down four out of there I a slot I once again they run little Griffin and he breaks it he's to the 15th and the USC territory at the USC 49 yard line the left tackle John Brant nailed him from behind but at the first down for Ohio State interesting story in this game is the center Steve booth Steve is starting this game because Steve Myers was out ill with mononucleosis and he has Monty Doris on his nut on his nose much outweighed he doing a good job there he is Ohio State on the Trojan 49 first down no score 8:45 to play in the first period first man through to pull back at jr. he's just replaced champ Henson and Keith carries of all through the USC 42 richard would the sophomore linebacker who made some of the allamerican teams in his first year of college ball made the tackle now going in its height in is Ted Powell replacing Fred puckett the ball is on the 42 yard line of USC Ohio State in possession they have a second and three and right now they're out playing USC out of the slot I the hand of the Griffin he slips away and this amazing freshman runs it to the 30yard line he slipped away from Jeff widens the tackle who had him contained watch him slip out of this six for 256 pounds wine is this is the freshman 239 yards against North Carolina to set a school record in the first game he ever played right the Buckeyes up a 14point underdog looked ready to play today now they're in a wide slot with Griffin and Keith and Randy Keith the junior from Cincinnati gets a couple it's a very young Ohio State team on this offensive team you're looking at right now they're only three seniors for juniors three sophomores and one freshman and they have only one senior on their starting defensive team you know caret looking at the USC and if you were to say what is the strategy well you attack speed they've got great speed in those linebackers you can't run away from them run at them second down seven to go Ohio State on the USC 27 nothing nothing game in the first period Archie Griffin six brothers in the family all football players three of them a play college football Archie Griffin load up on a 26 yard line of USC by Monty Doris and Jeff whinin and now Larry Wiggins is coming in at left guard replacing Jim Craig 'el for Ohio State probably the greatest asset that Greg hare 18 has is that he can run and run well and Morris Bradshaw has gone into the wide receiver number 25 replacing Mike for so statefair running the option the pitch out for Galvez the wing back and he appears to be short of the first down as he slammed out of bounds on the Trojan 21 by our team is Parker the safety man of USD from Sacramento and you saw goblets the offensive captain's signal over we're about that short Ohio State has marched from their own 34 for the 21 yard line of USC their fourth down the short yard to go and Larry Wiggins goes back into the left guard now let's see what they do Randy Keith and Archie Griffin are lined up behind Greg hair Brad now had his first suspenseful moment forth in a short yard to go and is given the key and it's very close very close now certainly have to measure this and the officials call for the measurement us three of health USC health and Richard would got in her underneath they delay to fit on that hand job that was just a lay you'll wonder out on a quick hitter how they have done all right carrot they would they've been very successful in that quick burst and suddenly they went away from it and now we have a timeout with 6:17 to play in the first period the score is nothing nothing I'm Jerry Lucas not the youngest guy in the league so I workout to stay in shape I'm talking about my hair every day I give it a 60second Vitalis workout it stimulates my scalp and makes my whole head feel good leaves my hair neat and healthylooking do something nice for

first down for USC so far they've been outplayed by Ohio State Mike rain looking down and he has his man at the 40 that's Lynn Swann who came back a Stepford to Lynn Swann is tackled by Jeff Davis this is what he's afraid of the balance of the Trojan team they could run it but when they have to they can throw it good protection good completion Lynn Swann according to USA is to them but Johnny Rodgers is to Nebraska you'll see Rodgers later in the Orange Bowl right after this game on NBC the Heisman Trophy winner Jake a McCain's in the game and garrison is out of the wide receiver Davis is flung down here at the 41 by then decreed number 88 watch this charged by the defensive end van 336 one and he's 216 pounds closing down the line now that's coming from the offside that's getting across al boy it sure is if you're not big Kirk you better be fast Davis is carried of all four times for 11 yards they're flanking Swann to the left and McKay to the right and four more now in a fullback replacing Sam Cunningham second down eight for us Leon their 41 the playaction pass gets away from Hazen Hall to the 40 and then to white shirt at Ohio State men Rocky Mount led by shad Williams number 79 second string right tackle defeat QC Chad Williams 79 a senior from Portsmouth Ohio carried the way those defensive team is coming and the way they seem to be slashing and showing great pursuit they could be a little vulnerable to the screen pass third down and six for USC on their 43 the quarterback reg here 5:13 to play in the first period nothing nothing Manfred mores fumbles the ball out of bounds I believe he's tripped out though on his 48 yard line so while they line it up the seventh in a series of football classic will be seen on NBC this year on Sunday the

sound on there 49 fourth and a foot they haven't hunting ham gift that yardage hurtling 225pound and run the hundred under ten seconds Sam Cunningham picks up the first down and you see where they put Sam not in the up position but in the back position he is big this fella has got to be outstanding Manfred Moore makes a good block huge he could hit that line very well boy he's a good one this for the first time USC has been at Ohio State territory around the Ohio State 48 no score just under five minutes to play in the first period fake that day the flag is down here's a deep pass and it is incomplete but a flag was dropped at the line of scrimmage and they were trying to hit Lynn Swann who can fly very dangerous man it's a legal procedure against USC they'll talk it over with Hazen Hawley allamerican tackle defensive captain number 70 see what he wants to do he's going to decline it it'll be second down 10 for USC on the Ohio State 48 you may be wondering why they declined it this is woody strategy try to get the Trojans in a second and 10 position now Swann after that long run on the deep post pattern goes out and Dave Boulware number 7 comes in Woody Hayes who says show me a good loser and I'll show you a loser second downtown in motion his ball where two pitches the Davis he's got flocking and he stretched it out oh he just keeps those feet flush to the ground he

great flock Alan Graff hitting in there manfred following him oops AJ just remember his blocker by Cunningham back in the flesh Seymour JK McKay replaced with garrison as a white man USC moving now first down in the Ohio State 33 brave under the gun throws it out us incomplete and he was trying to hit full where'll and air pinned against the far sideline but he was well protected by Jeff Davis 49 yearold John McKay it was an all Pacific Coast Conference halfback in oregon played in the same backfield with Dutch Van Brocklin retain a great deal of the zone defense this year Curt Ohio State is using it right now linebackers and making big drops they again have the team in the second and 10th position second down 10 USC has really picked up yardage on first downs this year they pull the guard they pull the tackle they have the fullback on leading and even the quarterback and the play is called student body right or student body left five or six blockers out in front of the tailback Anthony Davis the wines up for the 28 of Ohio State third down and five Southern Cal in possession and here Swan going up and bull we're coming into the wide receiver and timeout on the officials as George Hazen Hall comes to the sidelines going into replacing his Pete Kuzak number 71 I don't know whether there's something wrong with Hazen Hall or it's an equipment it seems to be him on Friday night ghost story becomes a new series of bizarre tales when circle affair from mirrors it'll be right here Friday night 9 o'clock on NBC third down five to go USC on the Ohio State 28 no score morning have enough to play in the first place there it is again and Davis ships out of bounds and they're going to place him out on the Ohio State 25 Rick Middleton forced him out the junior from Delaware Ohio and the state defense Kurt is really playing Ryan surprising that the Trojans can move it against this defense even Doug plank number 28 plagued playing that strong safety he comes driving up there USC is that to third down attempts failed to convert either time lane for Ohio State third down a fourth down two and a half fourth and two and a half that's the power I gray is going to throw it and just in the let it go he was hit a fence ray is deck fact thereby 71 pqz and 88 and the cream put a marvelous pass rush on him they think a great deal of cq2 6p6 to 231 19 years old he's a sophomore the fast protection has been breaking down for you to the Trojans there's a peak coming in got by Alan graph a good guard I'm out here in the Rose Bowl with a score oh how state nothing USC nothing the Ohio State back feel has Griffin and Keith and back compare the quarterback they give it to Griffin and Archie Griffin's to the 30yard line a very first game this youngster started he gained 239 yards against North Carolina which was an alltime ohio state single game rushing record as an 18year old freshman this is Nixon Ohio State on their 30yard line second down five both teams of that fourth down play stop even the other teams territory right on the ground ago Randy chief runs with the fullback you might wonder why Terrell champ Henson is not in it or more the leading scorer in the nation with 20 touchdown well Randy Keith is a better blocker and they're going now to the tailback offense and they just take Henson out but they're Griffin's been running well so they've been having keeping here to block for Griffin now Henson has got into the game Holy Cross there's key thought only crosses out they have a third down now and about a half yard to go this Jordan their 35 just with a power attack right here the old straight team they gave it to Henson wriggled off his left guard he's hit there by Carl's Anthony number 55 the linebacker has the first time for Ohio State the Trojans continue to use their 50 defense a fiveman line two linebackers really they're playing the end positions but they're really look more like linebackers they're not that big the attack Kurt again if you can hit right at that middle man and get one block on the linebacker this Harris dangerous on sprint out he has long loafing stripes first down Ohio State under 36 no score late in the first play ball Cheryl Philips number 49 applause flirted out of Griffin's hand there the first turnover in the game and the USC defense all year force mistakes it was so quick and aggressive USC has the ball by the way is the second string right quarterback or the other side of the field he wanting to play on Southern Cal now on the Ohio 38 yard line with two minutes 41 seconds to go in the first period no score Mike Ray puts them down in motion as Lynn Swann bake the David Rosen after the fat end our young in a crossing pattern and the allamerican tied in the best he's ever coach says McCain is not abound on the Ohio State 26 they call young the tree six feet four and a half ways to 30 so that play goes for a first down carry both offensive lines have some outstanding players John Hicks of Ohio State is a true allamerican Woody Hayes says he's the greatest and that's saying something offensive lineman he has Pete Adams 77 a very good one for the Trojans first down Southern Cal Anil Jose 26 the ksn I was a wide receiver the flip is is Davis Davis 15 Wow he just glides of those boy if you're right and he just gets super people on this is really student body right hey scram there's Cunningham that's Charles young making a block Newton body right goes pretty good three weeks after the Rose Bowl game Anthony Davis will report to the USC baseball team he's an outfielder when they say the brilliant prospect it's one of the reason they came to school he wanted to play baseball history under day to their famous baseball coach great chart by pete music number 71 a sophomore that's the way that's a quick charge class tackle across that line they lost three gets second down now and ten for a USC touchdown it's been McKay left one is the slot back inside of him Davis has already made 50 yards in the game and they're throwing this one for a touchdown gone for the score punt returner a great class receiver and a runner on the flank early bird he was wide open Jared got some foot protection a DTD by the way George Hazen all he's still out of the game they're working on his right arm Mike's canal it is in there they took advantage of the first turnover they went 38 yards in four plays and they score with a minute 30 to go in the first period Mike ray the Pat Haden holy rays kick is up and it is good USD finally struck me I've played for about the first two thirds of the first period and there's one bad news to opponent's next year he'll be back and there goes the Trojan horse across the fields an imposing figure now we talk about Anthony Davis kicking off he does kick off but very wisely John McKay doesn't send him down on the kickoff team he will hit the ball and then he plays defensive safety go tailback Anthony Davis will kick off Archie Griffin Brian bash Nagle and Jim Holycross our back seat Griffin's the middle man this one is coming to fashion agela freshman on the five getting that ball away from Griffin Johnny Gosch I haze up to the 2530 he gets a blue bear forty beautiful run by a freshman Bryan fashion Eagle of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania who is the star of the future for Ohio State it was a good pass receiver and has the move to be a dangerous runner a 39 yard kickoff return by Bosch Nagel Jim give hand I reserve in brought him down so good operating position now for Ohio State they're on their own 44 yard line so far u.s. leads have the ball 622 Ohio State seven minutes in the game there's a pass there was Amish life nearly interception by Eddie just at number 11 that ball would have been floated higher Holy Cross was running by Eddie Johnson the playaction pass that's the first pass at Ohio State's attempted in the game he's now in the second intend encourage not the greatest position he likes to use Rick Gow Bose he has an opportunity outside the linebackers as we have indicated are playing inside more Davis is 50yard freshman Griffin is 43 yard here's the option they fitted the Griffin the best 345 are they stealing them that's what u.s. he does very well with her speed that James Sims a very quick end up front 41 and Charlie Phillips the cornerback 49 hard to run outside on this team right Kurt they played that option well one guy playing off the blocker the next one was going to take the run away from the quarterback forcing the pitch and the halfback came up and made the flood john mccain with his teamleading 7nothing has taken Sims out and his pile was gone into the defensive end here's hair his passenger with a 39 yard line of us see Jim Holly front and Hara drill that went in there this fella is a good passer a the very strong Armani he does Curt he shows it here he is big and range in kind of a tradition of the Ohio State quarterbacks and he's witty Hayden had some good first down for Ohio State on the USC 39 where in the last 20 seconds of the first serious Holy Cross the spread to the right is the only man outside and bursting coolers Archie Griffin and a question was it for the 25yard line when these quick hitters up the middle the Ohio State front wall at resolution Bonica is opening up hold right remember Steve Luke is a late replacement and he's doing a fine job against his five there's a good block pull away really from Charles Anthony right to the safety man this is the kind of play Curt that made this man get some 772 yards this year he already has 59 yards in this game now Archie Griffin in the first period gained 59 yards in the ground that's the end of the first quarter that's for us c7o hioh station nothing ah here's an her his guide to big

  "transcript": "ladies and ruffles and flourishes being presented at John F Kennedy Stadium because the arrival now of a President of the United States President Ford having just arrived at nearby International Airport here in Philadelphia by helicopter from Washington DC attending the 75th diamond anniversary day a former University of Michigan football player out here on a beautiful day where the temperature is about 39 degrees lots of sunshine and of course a capacity crowd the last president to attend an armynavy game as President John F Kennedy in 1962 Navy won at 34 to 14 and prior to that in 1952 president harry s truman navy winning 7 to nothing now our national anthem Oh now we look at the brigade of Midshipmen some 4200 strong numerically even with the Corps of Cadets from the Hudson Bay to the membership of 4200 and today as they have for the past two years are playing for the commanderinchief trophy one initially by Army last year by Navy and a humiliating 51 nothing defeat of army so it's up for grabs again today and appropriately the President of the United States Gerald Ford is here to watch the game to participate in the toss of the coin of let's see if we can there's he call it is a tale it's your choice you'll take the ball with you here now the brave old army team three victories seven defeats the cocaptains for the Navy down on the field with the president Collier and Tim Hardin captain for Army the nonplaying Bob Johnson and the dark blue jerseys those football players from the United States Naval Academy and today we're proud to have the head coach of the Air Force Academy so it's been marking with it and on the far side of the field our main excellence appearance first year head coach whereas George Wells the coach of the Midshipmen is in his second year so we're moments away now for more pageantry and the opening kickoff of this battle I'm Chris Schenkel here in South Philadelphia with a native a man who graduated from the United States Naval Academy 17 years head coach of the United States Air Force Academy Ben Martin Ben you won and lost to these two teams what do you expect I think it's gonna be a terrific game I can already feel it right in the middle of my stomach it's the same old feeling I've had so many times and I think this is going to be a classic I don't think I've got as many goosebumps in any sporting event I got the same type as I got when we cover the Olympic Games wherever they are because this has all the the color the pageantry the excitement and today and protect with President Ford perfect day as we now get ready for the kickoff here at JFK Stadium 74 years they've played the game and kicking off his Navy Steve dykes and getting the ball is one of the great ones Marcus hearty of the army and hearty is nailed at the 6th a beautiful kick coverage that was durwood see Curtis number thirtytwo of Navy that came down and that was our great effective kick coverage by the Navy it certainly was and you know Army is the reputation running back kick off at that time they deviated from the center returned and tried to side liner and the Navy was ready for it surprisingly so all right arm in the back field goal ugly number fourteen the quarterback Doug drill number 37 45 audience tingling 44 so they try to bring it out poor Mac field and here are the army men the quarterback Scott Galloway number 14 Brad drill number 37 and junior there is Spangler the fullback the junior number 44 and number 45 is the boy who returned the kick Marcus Hardy so now with the ball at the 9 it's a second down and the Black Knights of the Hudson the Navy defense Marcus Hardy number 45 J winterberg as far as the ball is Jeff ooblar number 62 middle guard made the stop for Navy at the 12 so with a threeyard gain it's a third down and four and Ben Martin of the air force big play they needed here Chris they're backed up and they're going to be kicking out against that wind it doesn't seem like much of a problem there's no doubt it will be something we have been informed as not working right with the timer and the referee has come over here say mil Jay winter courage rock opera George Jay Becker the field Judge Joseph Brownlee the line James a Warner Empire Ernest t : oh and we have reserved officials here Thomas J Eliot and Everage a myris jr. that's the importance of this game and coach Ben Martin knows the importance because he's had all that service Academy experience Ben as a player and zuko right you know I deal in a case like this to keep it the field Chris the clock will not be official until they get us started it's critical but not in this time of the game it's early yet but that position on the field is critical I'll tell you Navy's really going to try to keep him back and the Army has to come up with a big play now third down we're looking at Army in the huddle now as Army has reached their own 12 with a third down and about four this is the first series of downs and incidentally on that toss of the coin it was a commemorative coin which later will be presented to the president as you look at Army's record it's identical to Navy's three wins 7 losses army defeated Lafayette Holy Cross and well the coach here the Air Force but a squeaker 1716 but then you did defeat Navy yes we had a tremendous game of both of these schools out there we're lucky to win on a field goal in the last eight seconds against Navy and we lost in the field goal in the last 17 seconds to army so we have the same kind of troops as they do it just a matter of the and that emotion you were talking about been started long before the kickoff oh it certainly did like about a week ago and then they came out on the field today everybody's really fired up and and the the Corps of Cadets or a gate of Midshipmen marched with pride a tremendous pregame spectacle I think that everyone is involved in this and not only the players student bodies but everybody that ever was in the Army and Navy really feels this it's kind of a gut reaction to a battle apparently having electrical trouble with a clock high above the stands here so the clock has we'll have to be informed no this is the third play third and poor and did they get enough it's going to be very very close to the first series of downs because maybe kicked off to army army and the white jerseys Dan Spangler moving the ball and it's a first in 10 for the cadets they really came up with indicated the first man through instead of the counter plan Navy was a little bit cold on that one 31 and adjust to the near side of the field first down from the 17 sighing look this triple making it into the belly of the pullback and fellow Glee met more than is matched by cocaptain Tim Hardin number 84 and number 55 skip Lind so there's a lot of amount of yard we've gone back to around the 16 so it'll be second down and 11 no score in the ball game it's Harley and white against Navy and blue maybe one last year 51 to nothing John Hodges now goes to the far side of the field of a second and 11 Mount Gilead Oh Ohio practically every state represented on the two rosters because the game represents all parts of the United States of America there's a closeup look at Brad Doral who carried the ball and the advances up to about the nineteen a threeyard gain its third down and eight this is the first series we're number 44 a pack of Monongahela Pennsylvania did his job so now it's going to be a port down walk down and about eight and backed upon his day Subin Gardner I think the offensive team westport we're going to go on a quick count and the less than jumped off it won't really change the situation let's just give him five yards more to fun listening the voice of Coach been marking marking of the United States Air Force Academy writer you'll hear from our colleague bill Fleming Tolleson will be on the sidelines as well a procedure penalty just brings in like five yards so now Dave Lupin gardeners you're looking at him right now Robin Amin number 80 is in single safety shielding his eyes because he's looking into a very bright Sun here in South Philadelphia may have its effect here is whooping Garner's and it's coming to the near sideline it is not a very tactic when only 20 yards and the Midshipmen of Annapolis now have great field position as they snap the ball for the first time Carl Willis was the man that put the rush on the putter will be back again in Philadelphia for the 75th armynavy game army was forced to punt at winnowing 20 yards as a result the Midshipmen of the Navy have a first at 10 at the 33 freshmen might both Montana as reporter back at his home 33 garnish the pullback another firstyear man Gary 43 up front we have owns 34 Seward 73 how do you read Driscoll might blur an Willie those are the men that will be up blocking or catching passes two of them for the backfield which includes Cooper our great one number 25 Jackson 38 7:43 second down and thirty that was creating a cooper tackle by mark smith the defensive left tackle from fresno california number 93 let's take a look at the portraits of the backfield men number 15 freshmen Microban this is number 80 aiming the junior now we're looking at Goodland number 43 the fullback and here is Cleveland Cooper was broken all records at the Naval Academy so now with a third down and 5 another test first word no score in the game let's watch from the field too soon roben on mark smith number 93 who now has to find offensive plays didn't do t know they come out of power I was a little innovation for Georgia lost his Navy came and then they use the motion to put their tailback out there that and it wasn't effective our he didn't seem to be surprised we're going to have a field goal now by Steve dikes number 91 the point is the 35 plus the 10 of Enzoani has a following wind of 16 miles an hour so it's a 45 yard attempt here it is it's up it's long enough so after only it's a play at the 28th the Midshipmen have just kicked pain or go and quickly take a breather nothing lame and of course the brigade of Midshipmen MIT happened happy and football Ben Martin we always know is a game of inches and that just got over that crossbar he did it was kind of a belly shot that didn't get airborne too much but it had a lot of power behind it they got the three point they've dykes to pick the 48yarder this year against Notre Dame just booted a 45yard you know three to nothing and thanks to the three points on the scoreboard for Navy Marcus Hardy is deep it's Hardy at the 5:15 Brahmi coming out drawing a crowd at the 2321 yard return and he's been averaging that this year returning kicks one of the leaders in the country so we'll be seeing him throughout the afternoon as now the cadets of army have the ball at about the 23 with a first intent so they have their deepest penetration following the turn let's see what they could do trailing nothing two three who's the hallway trying to land roll back off the triple opposition wishbone who that makes your hearts out something out the defensive end for Navy just went right across and took away the fit doubt Angelo's netplay that is the loss of eight yards at second down and 18 is Navy leads three to nothing Marcus Hardy alertly got over that ball number 45 who is one of the half backs the other is drill the whole back of the wishbone is 44 Spangler globally the quarterback number 14 Hodges set to this side and they go into a single setback for me brings it out to the 24 a 5yard gain and chef boomer number 48 from Kettering Ohio a junior the rover back made the stop but I see this play again there's a jet motor over back for Navy's perhaps the leader in that defensive set and he is really tough he's a skinny kid but he's very aggressive he comes up on colloquy makes the stop great open field tackle by chip mauler back home I sweat em to the far side is Hodges Daly in the slot on third and 13 is not doing too well as antibush act number 50 of Parma Ohio came into force army too whose tract is the pink kid he's 6 for 235 and really has the strength to move and he really complements that defense on a weak side super player how's the second Punk for Dave Lupin Gardner the guy work to kill Lucas on is Robert amines this time hope at Dartmouth the Jets went high in the air calling for a fair catch was a made member 80 and now maybe we'll start from its own territory from their own 41 there's no score in the game after another three to nothing inform that we have 8 minutes of 20 seconds remaining the first quarter as the clock high above the stands here at JFK Stadium is inoperative and as always the time has kept on the field so that official is relaying it to one of our men so now with navy leading three to nothing they start again from their own 41 raehwan Cofer number one one of the few players on either team that can bust one he got a step on the defense goes outside is stopped by Greg Dyson number 51 of Wharton New Jersey Darren we look at Cleveland Cooper you know all about him DeMarco he's a really a quick runner he's their leading ground gainer a record setter and he just needs a little crack of daylight specially on that sprint draw and he's around the corner my Navy puts them on top three to nothing second and five Jackson number 38 a New Jersey made he's carried on the play here again there in that power I set which is something that George Russell is very to be the basement over at they've had 14 plays so far in haven't sorted past I guess they're trying to establish something along that line of scrimmage I should do like the Air Force does go to the air we have to in desperation they should here I think it's 1304 very very close to the first down by micro band of Great Falls Montana the freshman quarterback as Dave done cabbage who made the stop we have a replay of his defensive work well done cabbage is playing the left side linebacker number 54 the left side of your screen he's really a good troop and he's a very short act where he reads those keys very nice being comes up to make the stop they did not make a first down so as I walk down and less than a yard and John stubble being do punters have long names Alison Gardner and stumble beams John Stovall beans a terrific corner very consistent stylee 40.8 yard average and back is Gary Smith a and a loose ball this sharperson a wide receiver now watch here comes the kick it's a low liner but should be handled but went right through and the Navy had a good coverage down after they have all right at the 13 yard line of our May first content maybe maybe leading three to nothing whoa BAM a slight penetration Levi's cure a good one a point Michigan the freshman fullback 510 193 and then on the play Rick kind of the middle guard number 91 in the defensive left tackle Mark Smith Prince Army has been very tough down inside the 10 yard line they really dig in they they stopped us on the 2 yard line you know goal line stands are kind of a rarity in football today but this army team is really tough when they get down inside their nation's oldest service Academy Army is being tested on a second and 7 now Cooper moving over to make the stop army and white if you just joined us Navy and the duck jerseys here at JFK Stadium and about four minutes remaining in the first quarter here we have that army defense digging in here comes a blitz up some of their pressure from the defensive secondary to make them turn up inside they wanted to turn the corner Navy leads three to nothing and now they have a third down and three at the army six Cooper that brings up this is very very close to that forward stake that's what's the referee Sam winterberg Chuck Baker and Greg Dyson defensively 82 and 51 and here comes the first measurement of the ballgame you know they did the smart thing they tested the inside and nothing there so they sweep right in and come back and sweep left I think that was good tactical move to get away from that deep end first and goal for Davie at 3:00 you're just joining us a 45yard field goal was picked by a navy about the midpoint of the first quarter and they have a three to nothing lead but now friendly that is the initial Navy first down they started this drive at their all three so the native of Lindenwold New Jersey of jr. number 38 Jackson baby goes out in front nothing on the scoreboard they having kicked the extra point yet but Steve dykes who hit the 45yard field goal as my jig or hold a point and here's the try for the extra point nothing Naval Academy in Annapolis oh right here of a supporter will take a pause for this message number 91 Steve dykes teeing up a ball the drive scoring drive by navy 13 yards following a punt which was recovered as we look at Billy the goat of the 19 the Academy by the class which include Tom Hamilton Marcus Hardy number 45 back in his own end zone and right now for the first time today we welcome to Philadelphia our colleague bill Fleming Chris thank you very much as you mentioned earlier the President of the United States Gerald Ford is here and did flip the coin at the center of the field to begin the game that coin a beautiful gold modeled on platinum will be given him at halftime and we would be here hopefully when he comes to the side of the field to sit with the Army Cadets grade the second half we'll have a chance to talk with first he was a former football player at the University of Michigan that was very knowledgeable about the game nothing mavey irony with the ball at their own 20 with a first down the quarterback giving 240 for Dan Spangler of Sidney oh hi Oh as president for the sunglasses bundled up on this day that has the temperature reading of 39 degrees and with many admirals at this moment you'll be joining generals and the cadets there corps of cadets after the first half five it's the second of five army occurring on the play globally number 14 of Easter our New York skip wind made the tackle for Navy Navy in the dark jerseys we're now looking at the army offensive huddle army team that scored 42 points like last week in North Carolina losing however 56 to 42 armies in a two tight end attack right now Chris they got them all bunched in there get out of their own backyard but now it's falling down on one no hardly gets the first down that was the 22nd play football game here in the first quarter and we're still looking for the first forward pass Joe Aranea and Bob Heslin blocked to get help get that first down which is now the ball is now the 34 army first and ten hopefully the quarterback is a junior maybe has had their emotions just on the fact that they had a 45yard field goal and then scored go Chet Mahler the rover back he's now playing corner because the two tight ends but he can really find that football and he stings a ball carrier every time he gets near him in white at second down tonight at the 35 caught on the field gets it off at the last moment 237 bro 35 up is the second of nine play jet motor again number 48 Kettering Ohio to stop this time at the 37 which brings up a third down and seven for the cadets Navy lady 10 to nothing this Navy's really proud that line is coming to this post up formation they're going to move up a little here's the first pass overshot the receiver and a safety man named Jean for Louisville Kentucky barely happy let's see the gun they come up the fake in the bone it's a pop pass from deep one receiver out but the ball was not on the target all right now it's Dave whooping gardener urgently shot him and a fair chance call for my mammoth molar who has been that Rover defensively molar calls for the fat cats so maybe as they did on the last series are right near their own forty one a 23 yard punt Nellie block the ball neighbour's card after punting the army recovered a fumble at the 13th on a first and goal what's the 45yard field goal let's watch the Midshipmen now and about their own carries on the play Rochester New York one of 10 brothers and sisters President Ford watching on the Navy side the first half that was a trap Bay at first half we've seen today Chris they almost opted to that's the kind of a thing that Cleveland cooker can go all the way on if they set that up properly two minutes and 37 seconds remaining in the first quarter for adjustment of horn maybe leading to nothing second and five number 43 one minute that's the first time it is so captain the left guard watching you to play up front with this way army territory for the first time and recover the puttan on the territory a fumbled punt and then went on to score an accordion environment Microban the fresh cherry wood ball into the mid group of Goodwin the poll back in are very much good for a first year man he sure does and they put him at fullback and he had that quick start he really looked out and there may be now into an unbalanced mind doing a few subtle thing defense they're going to be struggling a little long and then they're really going to turn it loose which is but Army's been doing to them too that's traditional on this Army Navy game to come up with new wrinkles yes it is every year there's yeah Cleveland Cooper coming outside showing you some of his early speed and I wouldn't be surprised sometime today he's going to bust a long way yeah he has that capacity no doubt about it Cleveland cook a great runner good day life moves and I went to give out the open he can run away from people in 72 in 46 yards last year it's a third for now six carries 27 yard for the first down Bob Jackson number 38 of Chuck Baker was one of the army defenseman who made the stop over Michigan football player Thanksgiving the White House came party of my school teammates called the 3030 Club for the Thanksgiving Day brunch that's beautiful accidents all about maybe went back to their balanced attack then even though or on a hash mark they're in a balanced attack again with they got that power I said 37 with the first lady Camdon open we're in the first quarter the waning moments beautiful white edge to Playland Cooper who got a spendin inside the burning an old stool Miller of Dunkirk New York number 32 and alles dark L starke El Camino Oklahoma thirty seconds remaining in the first quarter and navy has gained a 10 to nothing lead on a 45yard field goal and the touchdown from the three following a recovery of a army humble is off to the left are they second down and two a meme was the intended receiver and number 32 school Miller jolted him pretty good clearly did they CR Microban up close number one fast catcher is swifty good feat knows how to read those defenses whether they're zone or man gets open quite frequently it's gone 26 passes this year and spark touchdown 20 yards to catch now it's a third down and two I could Gilmore Long Branch New Jersey her to the outside and gets the first down and the gun has sounded the hijinks some of the antics that go with the game looking at a putt now that his operative seconds the last time ticked off and the first quarter has ended with the vendor from Annapolis leading men from West Point by a score of we'll be back in a minute a first snap of a second quarter will come from the army 18 Navy in the dark jerseys will be snapping it they gained a 1st and 10 on the last play of the first quarter they laid army by a score of 2 nothing Navy up to the line robot is a quarterback a mean to the near side of the field and man getting outside and coach Ben Martin looking out the first quarter statistics well the name of the game mr. typically is actually Navy has hasn't all gone from them of 59 yards total 24 no pass is being completed is a big difference I thought we'd have a little of that but I think the big difference in the stats is where Navy started their drives and where army started them Navy had all the field position in the first quarter alright if this is a drive that started at the Navy 40 and this is the ninth play of the drive second and five at the 13 marker down as ed Gilmore goes across but let's see there may be a ship penalty at the illegal procedure I'm sure it's Navy everybody around referee Samuel winterberg let's say if he throws that that sign again maybe in the lead by score of 10 and I think 14 minutes and 19 seconds remaining in the second quarter and we're glad that there is a clock operating here at JFK stick the all right hours shift penalty now let's go down to our colleague Don Tollefson there been many great ideas on the armynavy game over the year but the real economy Award winner occurred in 1971 that have been rumored all week before that game that President Nixon or vice versa nags you might show up Charlie before the game of Luna Dean surrounded by security men and there's the stadium the Corps of Cadets stood and saluted and finally the limo stopped in front of the Midshipmen and get to the Navy go but army got the last laugh they won that game 24 to 23 all right thank you very much Don Thompson we're going to have I replay of the down then it'll bring up second down to 10 from the 18 and of course following this game will bring the Edit version of ABC's Wide World of Sports but one of the most beautiful and international figure skating from Madison Square Garden a benefit event for the United States Olympic Committee and then coming up from the Los Angeles Coliseum at 5:00 Eastern Time will be the Notre Dame Southern California game Pat Martin oh that's going to be a super game of course we had to pleasure I use the word loosely of playing a Harris team in South Bend and they're very powerful but Johnny well at the end of the stage and it's going to be a real dingdong battle there is George well Dorothy I coached him any of the mid a long time ago I'm firewood quarterback second in town Jackson is motion maybe with the ball just over the fingertips of Robin aleem Midwest City Oklahoma number 80 bring up a third out of 10 a minute of the second quarter if you just joined us yes this is the game armynavy a 45yard field goal by dykes in the first quarter but maybe ahead three denominations maybe recovered a punt by army and went 13 yards in four plays to score a point was good it's 10 formation burned down in ten those wasn't that close great deal of pressure number answer number 86 and on the field man we have two players named Ford this was stand board and the stands President Gerald Ford and watches connect made the tackle on the quarterback robe and he no kid knows got really good though the ball was back the 18 was forward pass incomplete so now here is a five yard field goal attempt by Steve dykes who kicked a 45 yarder earlier well this one is into the wind does make a difference oh good jerry smith a bill blow me back on a play are you saying the statistic and Martin armynavy yes not not a lot of office the Navy's taking advantage of their great field position to get their points on the board army has yet to get it out well they can join anything and I'm sure they're going to another particular series open up that 35yard field goal at the first content their deepest penetration has been their own 37 in three possessions Spengler number 44 carried on the play from globe lake sidelines again Don one of the great parts of the armynavy game is the great support the cadets and Midshipmen give their games back in 1944 when our against nominator Ben Martin was playing for Navy his roommate rooted against him students couldn't travel to away games in those days because of world war ii and when Martin was playing in Korea with the turncoat Mitch party when you're moving against an army won that game 23 to step on the second of six play Markus Hardy number 45 of Lexington Kentucky carried on the play for two yards they packed 77 on the tackle so it's going to be a third down on the floor for Army which is yet to back here again the Navy defense let's see what they do here now they send Jen sick number 81 through the left side in the back a wishbone first down it's going to be mighty close Randy and Hutcherson number 41 I believe you made it Chris good good ramble way another one man pattern one third long that normally when Homer Smith wants to throw he'll go to that's written home ation with four quick receivers but that time he decided to go with a oneman pattern nice fiveyard gain Michael Oher playing a first down of his own 31,000 ability has a nothing final 30 seconds remaining in the first half from the wishbone 77 look at him he was there were 44 and even Ted Muller come in and knocked down the referee he wanted to get in on the action that he's a really good two player he has sinking free 234 a junior from Pennsylvania motion backward yes I know you did Ben Martin are going to be the coaches this year West game on the coast their deepest penetration is Andy Bush Act number 50 of Parma Ohio comes in to make the tackle and it's at just short of before watching Muller again the rover back for Navy's playing the corner spot here he comes up reads the option well he does a super job he's really got the pitch then he has to turn back in and help on the quarterback so now we have a third down in six Johnny Hodges 31 Spokane inside Marcus RT number 45 that sophomore about near the front stake the far side of the field the principalagent by skip the wind one thing you have to be with a wishbone and I think the army team is picking that up from coach Homer Smith and the staff as you must be patient they're our base place and then you counter them along the way but Scott below Glee is doing a super job and then their last game against North Carolina he really executed the wishbone the way it should be done and I think they're gonna pick up the pace here quite a bit soon right now yeah they got it Marcus Hart a from Lexington Kentucky that last why heydon't assistant off to the far sideline this place will be Bob Simon's looking for a senior from Brooklyn New York more each team with three victories seven losses the records don't mean a thing when they come into this gate they certainly don't print everything doubt the window they're all the same happy young man they all want to be bad later the intensity level and high winds to the far side over 89 which goes to 37 Gaudreau maybe territory for the first time today the 41 are they gonna fill out the man is forcing from the secondary and they executed that one perfectly the pocket the perimeter long as game was seven number 44 can leap old Cicero Illinois made the hole and now army has moved down near the 31 of the midshipman I think they gotta have a measurement of course they went back to what the coach used to call the chain that they gave that ball inside the pullback and what he's supposed to do is get that tough yardage for the first down I think it just missed it yes by less than a art and speaking of coach royal his Longhorns yesterday here on ABC television did quite a job well they started off fast and increased to face with every opportunity that was a great win for Dow of course it means a lot to Baylor to because of the conference championship and of course of the universe December 30th out of a Purdy and beautiful Jacksonville Florida the Gator Bowl right here on ABC we have a pair of tight ends de la 83 and Jen's dick anyone because they need some plucking a procedure penalty Oh Army's had a little trouble they've had a shift called against him a double shift as a matter of fact two of the back now the procedure which brings the ball back five yards to about 236 and it will be a second down and six Howie Williams number $89 learn army first down at JFK Stadium and we're enjoying the comments the United States Air Force Academy silver Google and really is fundamental skills and a hitting along that line and Scooby too great to watch okay back to the game from the 29 now Navy it's a first 210 for the cadets maybe the nothing a beautiful second effort by the quarterback Scott globally number 14 is Kubler number 60 made the stop here's Dan Towson one of Navy defensive stand outs left him Tim Hardin has suffered a possible fracture of his right wrist doesn't look like he'll be able to play any more than just after noon Chris oh that's sorry to hear that it's really dumb it didn't play in the game like this 89 now a Williams at the bottom your screen split in second and four globally over the ball I'd say the defensive end just came right across to deny that bitch and that's the way they're playing that thing watch Scott Kalu Glee coming right off the plastic triple option with the fake to the fullback comes out here that's not a loaded one this time so the end who has taken away the pitches right there no one to block him same thing to happen earlier in the game they're really defending that pitch job mommies have the ball for 47 yards 11 plays with 14 now first time there he is number 45 Marcus party caring for the cadets their number two rusher and he's caught a pass this is the counter play when you're flowing too fast with the option it comes back to the counter to criss cross so they give to the halfback from the far side he just runs today like this time Marcus Hardy doesn't find much test to go all the way around the end I gained seven so it's fourth down and seven with eight minutes and 39 seconds remaining in the first 41 they've got to get it in that maybe's check haulers sinks they are they let's watch polar again if you're going to go for it I'd stay away from Chad Moeller he is really a ball hawk run away from this fella number 48 he comes across the facts the quarterback driving deep spin team gives him no opportunity to pitch doubt at all great play on the defense his father a basketball player and gymnast at the University of Cincinnati so it's bred into him a little athletic ability oh he's very aggressive and I think the thing we respect most about jet ballers the fact that he not only carries out his responsibilities but he'll cover for those other mistakes up front yeah well it's first and ten now for Navy getting the ball on downs on a fourth and seven doing a beautiful job defensively so thou hast put the flanker back ami now to the freshmen right on first down leading tenth a nothing remain about Cleveland Cooper Academy forcing Cooper out of bound after a 19 yard gain first down at the Army 47 that looked like the old student body left blade there's a power step and everybody came out there had a couple of linemen to pull back the tailback Cleveland took them to this really bad seat a 2004 imprecisions he's never missed the game this is his 34th straight baby now it's a first and ten at the army 47 a the Navy leading a 26 to go first half very good one the freshman fall back up one sixteen that guy is really quick we create that when we played he really had the dimension they hadn't had or freshmen gone straight ahead that rapidly trotting off here at the bottom left of your screen if the first intent for David Cooper Davidge the linebacker 54 of Trumbull Connecticut was in on the tackle to the outside it's starting to tell a little bit now and there five but it's being spread a little thin a mean to the far side it's the second of three for Navy of the army 25 may be leading 10 to nothing second quarter number 43 are me number 51 on the tackle a lot of speed real quick starts but everyone in that Navy background now as we indicated maybe one last year by a score of 51 to nothing the most important win this year was an upset over Penn State seven to six of the navy blue and gold are showing their might here now in the second quarter with seven minutes approximately remaining with the first two penalty and kana submarining in to make the stop Cooper number 25 and the dark jersey coming back to the navy huddle you seem right there at the Army bench and wants to be roused about that that can change in this classic a mean now goes to the far side of the field second a night from the 13th they the freshmen good one number 43 is having I think they're low surprised with his quickness he really darts through that line of scrimmage Stan Ford number 86 made a sure tackle after they finally got him stopped along with Al Stark health so it's moving the ball to the 60 yard line a gain of seven which means about a third and one coming up the Army's got the shock troops in there they've got their down linemen in places their linebackers they're ready for that frontal assault bird down or a 6pointer Navy 65 yard drive in seven play with five minutes in 28 seconds remaining in the first half driver consumed three minutes and five seconds on the clock and the Steve Dyck soon but the first points on the board a 45yard field goal second extra point its huh so 528 left in the first half and the Midshipmen taken a seven all right we're back again at JFK Stadium and may be favored by a little more than a touchdown surprisingly have taken a 17 to nothing lead they got their first on a break picking up an army fumble of a Navy punt and when in in four plays 13 yards and Bob Jackson the junior tailback has scored both touchdowns New Jersey and maybe now kicks off leading 17 to nothing leave dykes kicking Marcus Hardy has the ball for army Marcus has brought down at the army 24 17 yard return and let's go to Don Thomas Army and Navy officers have always taken this game seriously seriously but back in the 1890s things really got out of hand a Rear Admiral or Brigadier General gotten such an argument that they threatened to have a duel when the Secretary of the war heard about it he decided to call off the game for a period of six years tempers finally cooled and they resumed the game in 1899 for the fainthearted first and 10 to the 24 for the cadets and it was Dan Spangler number 44 and carried on the play you just joining us a 45yard field goal by dykes of Navy put the Midshipmen I had and then a 13 yard for play drive following a fumbled punt recovery put them in Bob Jackson doing it and he did the last touchdown on the seventh play tapping a 65 yard second and eight now for the cadets other Oh unbalanced line again they sent the wide side of the field ran towards are unbalanced so it's a 21yard gain is real occur Billy nineteen years build a night babies mascot he's been the man got over the last two years he was a reserve mascot for five years before he got the promotion code seven Navy's mascot since the 1890 because they make great seagoing pen they'll eat almost anything always pointed towards the opponent's goal line in case the Navy quarterback forgets in which direction he's going on the play on a pursed intend from his own 45 and he brings it out to the 48 his pay pack makes the tackle one time the Naval Academy had other than ghosts as pets and a couple of dogs a cat even a bird bird was that or your reward Colorado spring is hurting he needed seven yards on the play and didn't quite get it but to bring up the spirits of the that's a little bit they did get in the Navy territory to well let's call it the 48 well they could get it the Navy is really forth in that not good shut up in there like did like know what the ball with the Navy 48 Army with a third down and three Hodges and the Navy defense law they really bunch them up toward the line the army has only thrown that one pass and so Navy's good playing the percentages they have nine men almost on the line underneath though Army's gonna have to put that thing up in the air sooner or later they normally do it from a spread formation he said in Lehmann Hall but I expect to see that very shortly and on fourth down and one at the Navy 46 Dave hoopin Gardner will hunt back Dave is robbing a mean was making 14:15 and he is brought down good coverage by the cadets 33yard punt as we look at President Ford will look at more football following this message as we take a pause in South Philadelphia all right this is the deepest point from which Navy has had to operate at their own 14 with a first and 10 and they lead 17 to nothing robe and giving to Goodwin Goodwin's had quite a and he continues his fine offensive efforts from the fullback position Chuck Baker and stark l82 and twenty making the tackle for the army defense it got something good gone they're getting the ball to Goodman that sets up a lot of other things being very effective he's breaking those tackles making a lot of that on his own just on those big fullback plant play maybe needs one yard for a first down on second down a means went to the far side the power i formation of the backfield behind the first with no man of their own and ahead of that forward state goes over number25 a tailback then once again he unbalanced my attack both sides doing that when they get the right side of the field they're utilizing all that space to get their backs in Running Room Cooper now 64 yards in 11 carries and two new men coming into the Navy lineup number 73 Randy see ward and number 83 tight end Kevin Sullivan from Philadelphia chest until Academy product aired Philadelphia 6 for 226 first and 10 for the Navy they went over losing the handle number 93 says its armies the will exploit for the official yeah they all they all vote out there on booze quality the entanglement looks like the Navy still Edmonton and rotating him down means keep that clock going so it's a second down and actually there's a four yard game despite losing the handle and coming back a bit cooper recovered his own fumble well he looks like a thoroughbred needs a good like a down in six now maybe 17 to nothing rather than a 32 to go in the first half comes over an outstretched leg so let's go to Dan Thomason this is the first season for Coach Homer Smith the man army hopes will rebuild their football program last year's field is the offensive coordinator at UCLA when the Bruins were the top Russian team in the country he played his college football at Princeton he served as an assistant coach at army and Stanford a head coach at David's in the Pacific before joining pepper Rodgers at UCLA in 72 when Rogers went to Georgia Tech this fall Smith accepted the head job here at when Chris okay Don following armynavy telecast Dave dials in the provincial College scoreboard they really will keep you uptodate always does each week and then at approximately 4:15 ice skating featuring Janet land and it's charity benefit performance at Madison Square Garden which includes many of the international stars for the benefit of United States Olympic Fund then at 5:00 Eastern Time from the Los Angeles Coliseum Woody Hayes joins Keith Jackson to do commentary on the Southern California Notre Dame game how do you think Woody Hayes will do as a color commentator I'm sure as you know Chris but he's gonna tell it like it is to what her pea seeds out there is gonna be described a very accurate terms I can hardly wait to hearing myself write so that comes at 5:00 Eastern all right amine flank to the far side of the field tomorrow I'd third down and seven maybe on third who is one of four they leave though all right Goodman carrying the ball and he did not get the necessary yardage his little sightseeing down there as though the ball have been fumbled but apparently not it is down at the 33 so there's a gain of four it is fourth down and three army was in kind of a prevent defense and expecting to lay it up and hit in the air and a navy crossed him up and went right at him with Goodwin but it was not successful so now we have a fourth down and three and Navy's John steffel beam will do the punting and a moment ago you saw Gary Smith a number 26 in single safety again looking into a bright Sun this jeonse double beam is a soup that did I guess noted Amy had a 53yard average that made a big difference in the really kick the ball emulating 17a nothing very read snaps the ball the kick is on its way thank you can a mouse being protected by the Midshipmen in the dark jerseys and it's inside the 25 of our me traveling 44 yards 56 seconds left in the first half George Heartwell with in his second season as baby head coach is the first Naval Academy graduate to go to the Midshipmen since 1947 he played at Navy during the 1950's and he still ranks sixth on their alltime passages whole offense list he was an assistant coach for ten years at Penn State while there he could sit down standing backs was my delve into the John huh big all right Blumenthal a new quarterback formation puts one into the air a freshman popke florida through one bye Chuck hi sink this foot up number 46 so are me coming in with a little razzle dazzle now and they have come up marquee with their first completion yes they have and this is a way they do it the format is the bring in Lehman Hall and they're spread formation from the tees a drop back pasture big tall kid who has a nice delivery Navy's gone into a prevent defense was just three up front five short and three deep so I think they're in the defense to contain him but he's going to make a few yards if he's on target all right was an early indication of a first town and then a measurement was called for Tyson catching the past so now it's a second down and a little more than the length of first about the thirty four five always governor would be catcher trying to say there was interference but heaven feeder number 19 of Memphis Tennessee intercept here it goes again Lehman hog dropping back in the pocket he's throwing along when a fly pattern way downfield but that prevent defense it really has three safety men back there that's really tough to throw deep against that kind of his own contender for Bob Woodcock this is the second arm eternal this time not as dangerous as territory as the humble hunt but it is at the 23 of Navy as the Midshipmen lead 17 to nothing 36 seconds leading to the first half go back to the 27th as Rick canal number 91 of Winter Park Florida worst amount of Alice Murray is number 99 91 let's see him again he's really good over the center as a nose dry he's quick he hits a good shot on the standard and he finds a ball pursues nicely that's a good pursuit pattern down the line now he's got the cutoff angle right on row man and he gets him on a nice tackle from behind why some coach Ben Martin of the United States Air Force Academy completing his 17th years head coach what a job he's done all right Cleveland Cooper on a second and seven to come ooon he really can and he got it out around now to get close to the midfield state Don moody 25 and Jeff Bruckner number 61 who stopped him and forced him out of bounds it's a first and ten at the 41 now Cooper with 13 carries 86 yards Steve Berra 'glitch South Bend Indiana a junior comes in at left tackle the Navy offense number 75 Mike robe and carrying knifing off to the far side of the line as Dyson makes the stop number 51 joined by done cabbage and on the field clock 15 seconds in the first half there's a mortar without the helmet of a microbe and number 15 from Great Falls Montana is one of the very best in the state of Montana we knew a lot about him he was the outstanding high school football player there I think on that last play however Chris that that was a broken play mishandled the ball I'm sure they didn't want to sneak the ball at that point in time they were set up to do something wider to throw it but so they had to use one of their timeouts like the idea of freshman playing yeah I like it if I had Microban I'd flame too I think it's a good scene there are great many talented young men in college now and I think most of the coaches were surprised when so many freshmen made it made it big but now they're they're confident they can do it and he see a kid like this really cool and poised and a great football game that's really a super effort by an 18 year old young man coach Ben Martin and you're normally nestled at the foot foot of the Rockies and you know about ice skating a lot of Springs being a center Janet Linn appears right after our telecast today and a the benefit and she's great yeah wine rules I couldn't seven now from the 44 and even million that arm brought it back and trying to get away there was a tremendous army rush led by Ray Beverly number 68 us and Antonio Texas as time runs out now only six seconds left on the clock and it brings up a third down of course Robin I mean being the number one receiver when he's down he attracts a crowd an army had to deep zone with two people really watching him inside and outside there was very little chance for that pass to be completed and we hope that at halftime bill Fleming our colleague will have an opportunity to chat with the president president United States Gerald Ford he said he seated in the Navy side on a near side for the first half enjoy the cheering of the Corps of Cadets some 4200 strong the Navy huddle out in third down and seven from the 44 six seconds left in the first half Navy is in the lead 17 to nothing and I formation rightio screen up the middle they were in a prefab with a super safety back there no sense kind of throw deep probably be picked off so Georgie West went to the center screen I think it's a good call I do too it was intended for Goodwin number 43 and it brings up fourth down and seven with two seconds to go in the first half what would you do here Ben well you've got one chance that you can flip it on an inside pattern to a good receiver and see if you can run with it or you just haul up and lay your ears back and throw it deep and down the sideline I mean at the bottom of your screen now out of you number 80 all they decided to just try to keep the vault almost broken is romance so it's had time with the score Navy 17 Memorial Stadium in Philadelphia Pennsylvania after a word from our local station President Gerald Ford was at John F Kennedy Memorial Stadium today marking the first time since 1962 a president has made that visit that of course too late John F Kennedy early in the first quarter Steve dicus it from 45 yards out that put navy up in front three to nothing later in that quarter maybe got a break when this punt was fumbled by Gary smithy and he covered by khalsa percent and that was up the army 13 yard line four players later Bob Jackson was having a big day both three yards off tackle for the day two touchdown and it's Shipman led 10 to nothing after that first quarter Billy the night team like what he saw like but he was chomping on and with five and a half minutes left in the first half Jackson scored again this time our six yard spread around the right side with the extra point Navy's lead went out to 17 to nothing and Army's gonna have a tough time there after trying to get their act together at halftime this is Bill fight back at John F Kennedy Stadium where the President of the United States now is at the center of the field everyone is standing around at this moment he is receiving the commemorative coin which he flipped at the beginning of the game the army brigade commander james caleb co st. Louis Missouri here's a company there by the superintendent of the Academy made the general Sidney Barry and the men from Davey the superintendent Vice Admiral William feedback and brigade commander midshipman captain Jim Adams of Beltsville Maryland James Schlesinger the Secretary of Defense is greeted the president at the center of the gridiron now the president airheaded today despite this rather wintry day it is a sunshiny day he is dressed in a fur collar coat as you can see now his shaking hands super antenna Caturday Major General Gary next to Major General Berry is James Marshall drew the Secretary of Defense who has been accompanied today by the Secretary of the army and now the brigade commander James ed power is escorting President Ford to this side of the field and we hope to be able to we're living extra special to this game well I've done two I think four or five armynavy games and every one of different ball game every one as interesting and plus all the excitement the wonderful cadets and Midshipmen I really enjoy being here ago I think the core is hoping that you will bring them as good a luck as you grow the Midshipmen at 17 nothing against them well I didn't dare mention that I might bring the army luck when I left the Navy side but I can sure little for the army now I guess Hollister president football has played a great big role in your particular life just two days ago he had a wonderful reunion with Grand Rapids South the team mates well that old gang that I played high school football with in 1930 we've gotten together every year and Thanksgiving which was the anniversary of our state championship game so you see 23 out of the 30 back it was quite a thrill for me I noticed too that Silas Magee was was back for the first time of what 44 years this was the first time since 1931 correct he's been out in the West Coast as a longshoreman and just retired and we had a hard time finding him but he got some friends that helped him get some money and he came out he was as big a ham Thursday as he was a airplane fall you know one week ago you were in bottom bus dog at your historic summit meeting with Soviet secretary Brezhnev and at that time everybody here in the United States was very much involved with football particularly Ohio State and Michigan how did you get word of the game well as a matter of fact they woke me up about 5:30 in the morning which was Sunday morning out there and told me the bad news from the point of view of Michigan and they tried to console me by saying that the kick almost went over in the last 30 seconds but those games are great bill I fortunately played in three of them I won two out of three but they seemed to mean better ball players now and put on a better show so he sent her a little differently now don't they well then when you said it we think we used to do that pretty well but it's a lot easier to Center it the way they do now and block we used to have to Center and block so at least in one aspect I think we did a lot better than they do today well thank you very much for joining us President Ford we want to mention to you that on November 22nd 1975 the Buckeyes will be in the Michigan Stadium if you and mrs. Ford and Mike and John Steven Susan can come I'm sure dime cannon can find six tickets well I'd like to say it I had planned out of this year but then we ended up in flat of a stock so I got it by radio and I I'll see you there in the 22nd fine thanks very much sir bye now hi president Jerry Ford now will accompany the Corps during the second half of this game so we'll be back in just a moment the add States Military Academy is dedicated to frequent updating of learning styles indicative police reports of the best point is an instructional support system which encompasses a highly sophisticated educational television network as well as an academic computer center this television system which has been in operation for over one and a half years includes 600 monitors distributed throughout the academic area for the use of cadets television instruction is designed to supplement rather than replace classroom learning in the hundred and seventyfive courses now offered at this point 25 fulltime staff members are needed to operate and maintain the system is 3 million dollars worth of equipment a cadets also have access to over 150 computer terminals some of which are even located in the barracks the computers are used in a wide variety of courses but are particularly useful in the hard science areas that are curriculum together these television and computer systems after today's West Point cadets the latest in educational technology earlier this week I also visited the Naval Academy in Annapolis Maryland where a program of very dynamic growth including very much construction is nearing an end in 129 years the United States Naval Academy learned long ago the tradition alone is not enough to sustain a great institution in order to continually attract outstanding young men the Academy is committed to constant upgrading of facilities faculty and curriculum the Academy is nearing completion of a new construction program which is the largest in its history and it includes this new nine point seven million dollar library the Nimitz library will eventually hold eight hundred and fifty thousand volumes needed by Midshipmen who today are choosing from over 500 courses in 27 major fields as recently as 1964 all Midshipmen took the same 40 courses during their four years here at Annapolis now being completed adjacent to the Nimitz library is rickover hall a twenty seven million dollar engineering studies complex one phase of the construction program which was particularly welcomed by Midshipmen was the conversion of Dahlgren Hall into a full fledged recreational facility the most notable aspect of the new complex is an ice hockey sized skating rink which can be quickly dismantled and converted into a ballroom for so the halftime is continuing here at John F Kennedy Stadium as President Ford now has gone up on the Army's side there you see him greeting the various dignitaries in that box incidentally is Bob Hope who is enjoying the game today there's army secretary Howard both Calloway all of all a wonderful occasion back in a moment well it's very strange to be hearing the strains of the victors bars a victory song of the University of Michigan as an armynavy game but of course it is in honor of the President of the United States who incidentally wore number 48 at the University of Michigan and I took note of the fact that the Navy's Chet molar wore number 48 in that first half and played outstandingly on defense as you probably know President Ford was also a former Navy man there's Bob Hope there on the left clowning around a bit and trying to get a view of who else is up in the booth Chris do you have a word yes thank you very much we're tempus juries are know of Kodak gets the gold medal which President Ford received two years ago the army team is back the Army Navy game is brought to you by conjecture twin blade the twin with Teflon coated edges by Chevrolet you're invited to see Chevy's lineup for 1975 mature Chevy dealers man Chevrolet makes sense for America and by Goodyear the makers of Bigfoot the new poly steel radial tire it keeps its feet even in the rain 17 to nothing is the halftime score and coach Beth Martin of the air force academy our guest today analyze it for us coach well I think the story is right there and rithmetic Navy has first of all a great deal more than army and passing has been virtually nonexistent I think that that's the key to the thing that army is gonna have to be able to throw the ball now that and they can do it and they go that's great formation they throw the ball very well and I think we'll see a little bit of that very early in the second half ride with President Ford now on the far sideline over there near the Corps of Cadets we look at the Midshipmen of Navy who have taken a 17 to nothing lead as the second half is about to begin a 45yard field goal which broken ruminated game record which was Football Hall of Fame official four years of an army player Colonel ed garbage today my Steve dykes of the Naval Academy yeah fieldgoal take this go I think it Jarvis is the name is synonymous with kicking field goals over the years so that's a great Nvidia to somebody to kick a ball as far he did in the old days his super alright and speaking of Steve dikes who broke the record with our 45 yarder here today you'll be kicking the ball from his own 40 with the wind to his back an army will be receiving it and hopefully we'll be able to move it a little better than they did the first half still standing President Ford on the right now Marcus Hardy is deep party who returned 25 kickoffs this year for a school record of 603 yards including a hundred yarder for a touchdown against Duke and a 95 yard in their build he's very dangerous alright here's that kickass hi it's Hardy he's got it at the four or five 10 15 no hole there so we'll try to move it the first day we'll have these players Hodges leap old Erina no Casto begley Moritz and daily and the ball will be snapped from the 23 yard line first and ten boys Inc you think the started thinking half the see of the strategy one obtained Johnny still in there they go with their study quarterback Scott galore Glee and the fullback from the wishbone Dan the Spangler number 44 carries on the play in the backfield portraits of the players Gilad lay down at the bottom he didn't like it he's a junior and we have Dale drill read a couple of fine runs number 37 in the first half dan Spangler who carried the ball in the last play and Marcus Hardy so now it's a second down and six from the 27 for RB they trail second play of the second half and Bangla gets the call again and he comes a little closer to that forward state but the pair is great they'll need the third down and hopes of getting a first down as push act again makes the time and played well for maybe today I think that our meeting a little bit reticent to put the ball up in the air in their own backyard but I'm sure think it out in in a wide open territory pass that 40yard line when they are the quarterback state the local number 14 and he gets a first down and that should help the cadets move it to get some accomplishment gone I think it really bolsters the spirits they're really going to be hitting now from the 34 with a split in Howie Williams to the far side first down the way the lovely what's the troll Oh beautiful castle and a five Tony daily a mask on top of a 35yard strike and daily the end related at the throw back at the play fake and a beautiful fall right on the money and the referee Samuel winterberg goes 15 closer to the navy goal Dean by practicing in fact he adds about the best chance he had to keep that we've been going all away he just grabbed whatever get ahold of it so army really has an opportunity here Chris that's not a lumbering tie Tim that cut that ball either now it's the first Ferrari Marcus Hardy number 45 nice off to the right side let's see a replay of the facemask violation just reaches out and grabs it because that's a dangerous thing and it is a big penalty but you can really severely injure someone so it's a 15yard er from the spot of the foul after Spengler carried on the last play let's see what globally the quarterback of Army will do in a second and eight from the 13 they is in the lead 17 to nothing always from JFK Stadium in Philadelphia Marcus RT nice across the 10 down to between the eight and nine hash marks the back in that unbalanced line a tag and they went to the wishbone power playoff tackle to the strong side that I'm pretty effective home you're shocked occasionally see Navy's female cheerleaders they're from other colleges in the Annapolis area numbered here today and a third down and Oh Dean of the yard so brings up a fourth down pay pack offensively strong on the play for the Navy defense number 77 the defensive left tackle sold them all between the hash marks eight and nine and it brings up a book down and as we look to the far side it's a three good three yards for the first down and they're not gone for any field goal here they've got to get it six pointer I'm sure Homer Smith knows that he has to make a conversion out of this one so you're going to see a fake walk down in three are made bad oh it's really close stakes are on the far side the opposite side of the bill as the referee winterberg looks to the far side Anjani warner jr the crew for the corps of cadets not make a lot of noise but should it be to that Vantage here plenty yes you're a will you will know without being able to see which way it goes but is very close and army came back to the weak side of their offensive formation a time for the option play i think it's a good call just not enough field to give him the running room they needed he had to cut back up in there to try to get the yardage and maybe gives you the indication that they did not not make the first down with about two feet to go and ironically that really made the key tackled now you're looking at President Ford Major General Sidney Barry United States Military Academy superintendent and a man that has done so much as an American Bob Hope so Navy has the ball now first and ten after own six Amin is linked to the far side of the field in the back fired up good one was in there with the carry and 51 Dyson and also 94 trailer Tiki trailer as we look at the offensive line of Navy on C word ecology reef Driscoll along with feckler number 56 there is a look at Microban the quarterback from Great Falls this is Robin Amon number 80 this is Jerry Goodwin Waveland Cooper on a second date lady stop attempt all this is a very important series for the Navy just as it was for the army before they've got to get out of their own backyard in this play in particular it's very significant whether they'll put it up in the air to get it out of there I rather think they're they've got a big choice to make here right because it's third down and six and the ball is 5 to 10 we have 10 minutes and 29 seconds remaining in the third quarter Navy with the ball leading 17 to nothing maybe has converted one of six third down drive here's another in motion Jackson maybe touchdown that he did not make the Navy first down so it will bring up a punting situation and on come with a specially team of hunting team well they do have a good kicker and John stuff will be my rather I think that they decided they wouldn't take any chances to have a turnover deep in our own backyard they have the wind at their back and we're the kids are like the double beam I think that was the percentage play all right look at them limber up that leg he's really a high kicker all right it's number 21 John BB 4:26 is Gary smithy Marley rolls dead at the army 35 and a half a 50yard punt we'll be back in a moment message on stubble beam and they gave him a roller and he showed a lot of cool light they picked it up and hurried a little bit but got some rhythm into it and you shows what a perfect high kickin form he has got 50 yards out of that kick reminds me of Sam Snead the golfer who can get that leg above his head and speaking of golf I'd like to congratulate you on winning the National Football Coaches doctor from the 36 now army has the ball party number 45 ball carrier gets the order to is bush act makes the tackle army if you just joined us have made their deepest penetration through the eight on both down here comes a pants outfit that's Lehman Hall and it spread formation team they're going to go the air lanes now Chris alright and I'm glad the bomb squads in there we need a little over the army Leland Hall is the head of that unit number 16 of freshman 65 there is crisis of down the middle and it was low I'd say the first shot out of the gun the Navy did what they sure that kids a freshman they put the Flitz to him and he had to release early they're going to try to get him rattled because at the time he can throw that ball chucked Isaac was the intended receiver number 46 Hall now has thrown three times completed one for nine yards so now here he is with a third down and about nine for his own 37 Woodcock the reporters inside all rifling one and all yes Jeff Scott number 53 with Michael Georgia a junior linebacker Roldan the Third Army turnover now he threw that one into a crowd they went from the blip locked on defense to a drop back zone that time and he didn't have time to read it and superposition for the Navy they scored one touchdown getting a full recovery at the RV maybe good within the fullback during the hall to the 42 of our me so it'll be a second down and three done cabbage the linebacker number 54 on the tackle I've been around a lot of service Academy games the last half we thank you by a freshman of leave nothing happening for that by another please with the other side of the line is good that's really pressure the second of three maybe leading 17 to nothing they're moving a ball forty little more than one Chuck Baker along with tacky trailer of freshman from Rockland Ohio and on the plane now Bartlett Ola first downs of which 21 have been made on 19 of them by rushing that shows that passing has really been a secondary role here today one Gilmore first down you try to mention this many home there's a representation our country if you landed in the entire core and the entire brigade really as I think the core in our cadet wing and a brigade of Midshipmen there from all over the 50 states I think it's nice that the football team should be from all over the United States do Robin Ameen to the near side of the field first intent for Navy at the 35 of Army they lead 17 to nothing maybe pass by Robin and after catching the ball Kevin Sullivan wanted more what I'll kill Cheston Hill Academy product / patterns where they clear the song with the input the title ring very popular pattern and it was that community first intent now for the Navy from the 21 army now against Navy on this plastic game of failed to score in six quarters last year they were shut out 51 to nothing is now 17 to nothing the game is part over 643 to go third quarter Gilmore from Long Branch New Jersey carried the ball and Mark Smith of Fresno California on the tackle 66 was the cocaptain now moving back into the Navy huddle College Texas a senior in 15 might romantic great Donna and a fair debate 5357 rather steve McCraw all pan so texas a freshman watching so now it's the second diode at seven Beckett second at six maybe with the ball the delayed penalty took a little too long to get her gone Bob Jackson moving following will be the Prudential College School Board that they've dialed and and it's going to be ABC's Wide World of Sports an abbreviated version but one of the most interesting and beautiful and musical that you will see ever international figures game to tell it away we were there on the beautiful about 15 Easter time and then follow Southern California going against Notre Dame baby food second and 12 as we have a penalty I think the whistle is long but that was a flood pattern they were unbalanced to start with an innate emotion Jackson after the homicide so they had two receivers for one man in the zone to cover and robe and did a good job of picking out the open man little more than three hit a little less than four on third down now down conversions coming up laterally along with cabbage that she wants army to win that way I'd say maybe he's got the speed factor gone for now I feel for her they're really move on right fourth and one would you go for three I'll go throw first down or sex we did say what to do now I think they're gonna go for that step all right your football philosophy I know my light they are those and where this much of the lead all the clothes lady calls time out here at JFK Stadium in Philadelphia the 75th game for 47 to go in the third quarter and Navy is in the lead over army 17 to nothing Hydra back again at JFK Stadium in support down and less than a yard for Navy Navy that started this drive at the 49 following an interception of an army pass and they go for it on fourth down leading 17 to nothing here in the third quarter very good with the pullback and looks from here now the indication first now the ball is right on the town let's go down to my contusion left lay down the navy trainer tells me should be able to go back in the game soon Chris okay thank you don Tolleson no plumbing down on the field as we now have a first contender balls on the stripe navy scored the two Navy touchdowns Jeff Bruckner number 61 on the tackle here on the near side of the field 38 Bob Jackson the Lindenwold New Jersey 64 231,000 a lot of size the lines are quite the size of other NCAA colleges Army's offensive line 222 found a verage maybe defensively Navy 216 and army 207 Army's inner goal line defense they they run a 65 on that other play and they're ended again expect second on three for three and are they at the challenge Rick come in number 91 same there in the white army jersey an interesting thing before the game they they came out in white jersey why does it have now that's unusual then they had to go back in and change again somebody got the signals both and I think they're keen on Bob Jackson now because he's the guy that's really hurt him down in close they're gonna have to change up and give that ball to somebody else I guess nine plays on this drive it's a third down all that the super deep this time Gilmore carry the law and walk down and this is what it's all about right on that goal line but everything is important about earlier 24 seconds developer after stopping maybe on both down now trailing 0 to 17 they Navy blitzed him and caught the run the option play that are given it do it they found out heart was one of the players our number 84 the cocaptain midshipman and under lovely they had to gap defense they mr. Boff made that penetration which is a dangerous thing when you're that close to goal line and maybe was very effective in it putting on the far side laying down army captain Bob Johnson can't do anything about it because they operated without a here we played a great young man number 47 right I'm surprised to see Athena Robin Devine has a for Naevia 30 35 40 up to about 45 18yard return by May the moment aims are nothing and we have two minutes and 16 seconds remaining in the third quarter of play part of the brigade probably the reason for their place to grab the pun is to win now speaking up for it a bit and would not have gained in that much they figured they do they get a power kick down low to get the ball downfield as far as they possibly could spend Montgomery horse Academy and motion Jackson first and ten about 205 pounds and he discovered dumb cabbage in on the tackle the defense is done savage linebackers picked up the bootleg which is a tough thing trying to fool him too thin fool him as a good hit right here as Microban puts on the power and gun cabbie really brings him down though their save a longer game and number 15 micro man holding his head oh we have a quarterback bill California junior number 16 carry for a couple of yards on a second down and eight connect on the tackle yes per year was the starter for many games Chris and I he'll do a super job from there he knows the offense he knows his play he'll do a fine job with a navy theme ago but we hate to see Microban go out of there here throw two touchdown passes this year and written about now he has a third down and two down on the ground with good words fall back well that good when he really started really Gary's in 80 yards through that line a pullback plant blades and we have a different server Cuchillo Brooklyn New York through the 52 first of ten an army territory they have tipped that ball for your that's the first throw much on that oh it's a second down intent now here at John F Kennedy Stadium with 40 seconds remaining in the third quarter robe and shaken up the part to us is that he will return to the fourth Cleveland Cooper number 25 gentlemen providing a very high one punch or the Naval Academy connect number 91 the middle guard on the tackle and the stop was made at the 34 so it's going to be a herd down at about three all these possessions plays are turning that clock around fast which is what army doesn't want to happen but Navy knows it and they have done a good job of maintaining possession over freshman Steve Mellish of Orlando Florida number 22 pain to stop we'll be back for the Harbin moment staff of the fourth quarter Navy with a fourth down nothing big play and Goodwin appears too afraid the Navy first down let's go to Dan Thomason quarterback micro VIN and the slightly bruised left shoulder doctor right now and they tell me be able to go back in the game later Thank You Don no clothing Don Thomason coach Ben Martin we're all here at JFK Stadium in Philadelphia the first of three big events this afternoon on ABC International figure skating at approximately 4:15 of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time in California first attempt for navy of the 30 Walker is down sad Spira kana kaanum always playing a great game and those guys he's quick he moves around runs around those blocks and the penetrates very quickly at super play by down linemen and the third quarter statistics I think the significance of that is that total yards 281 and those turnovers down the bottom oh my goodness and we have an illegal procedure family and it's going to be a second down at 18 the laws open to person traffic you probably saw him was number 43 the whole back area Goodwin Cooper going outside and Mark Smith made the tackle that was the second of 18 plan let's see to the 29 gain of nine Cooper's had 18 carries he has passed a 106 yard mark there he goes limping off the fielding he's the first player in Army Navy history to go over 100 yards in three successive armynavy game it's not a tribute to his ability I really it needs a great competitor alright third and nine for Navy of the army 29 per year buhbam again they are really fired up that are made offensive name another Cleveland clipper Christy reminds me of Anthony Davis mess see same running style about the same size a very scintillating runner got the quick wheels I think the network's interest and real good football plane but people like Cleveland running the ball and Anthony Davis and with the comments later I hope good as you are on the FC Notre Dame game oh he liked the good foot boat they will just decide right stop we'll be back on fourth down at 18 he will get the ball sniffing voice the Dean perceiver but the lady protected and the gang army back to its wall again will try to move it from the seven all right army has the ball first intended their own seven locally as the quarterback pick number 83 tomorrow Maryland that shows a little courage outdated throw it right from inside the shadow right there but I was well executed into a little hole in that zone ten yards is what they needed has receded again well executed play all the ways the red zone of all is delivered perfect timing Bob Simon's has come into the lineup number 34 from Oakland New York where the first of 10 maybe leading 19 to nothing Oh John Hodges of Princeton New Jersey Hodges has been a number one guy and he split wide he got zone coverage out there I gets a little cushion breaks it off onto the first down yardage he's heading for that chain gang and he sees that heads right for it that's a rolling thank you to play good timing against the zone and it brings them out to about the 28th a half of the first and ten and Holly Williams 89 is put to the near side of the field I think we're in the poll have to go Tampa party number 84 San Luis Obispo California was in there and two quick later you save number 84 he is the cocaptain yes when you're when you throw a play fast fakes like that and the defense knows you have to pass by it does give him a little advantage so they just dig in and rush to faster despite the play fake three or three in this half of the nine the Junior yo wishbone attack their mother that's a winner but the pitch was taken away very nicely by the crew of people on the Navy defense grande huntersam number 41 on the tackle you see there there's the choir like level of Navy we have a third down coming up and now the passing team yeah here comes you split up and and they're going to go to pure Pez right now Bob Woodcock 14 is set to the nearside third and seven they'd be treating their information very well not giving a Hall much time and no real escape routes say it comes another team on the field this time fourth down situation Jeff Sam and Martin in Colorado Springs number 61 gets a little fencing credit there yeah we know just a few is an outstanding in high school player right in Colorado we missed out on a super kid the three service academies Dave Lupin garden and it goes out of bounds at approximately the 38 of Navy so with 10 minutes and 46 seconds following up putting one yard we'll take this pause in Philadelphia 1046 remaining in the game the 75th harmony of the classic Navy leading 19 to nothing they have the ball against President Ford watches first and ten quarterback is Microban ever shaken up earlier he was handling let's go down to that policy aimed one man would have to be there nine playing Captain Bob John Johnson who is the first black captain an army history is not played in a single game this year the summer you had a cancer removed from his right arm in order to avoid possible permanent damage he had to give a football the first doctors thought he would be unable to receive a combat commission but he told me earlier this week they will get that Commission and fulfill a lifelong dream to Mike Yeager number 10 Henderson Texas our junior alright good defense by Connor the nose guard he beats the double team block and hits it off the ground he had gone to the strong side they ran a weak side play made a nice recovery and made the tackle that's a super connect the winter park board a senior six weeks so now we have a third Prive from the 43 marry the ball and it looks like was it Rome and that came over to cover the ball yes it was it's a lot good hitting up have been rounded back or maybe on a fourth down and for the snap will come from the 44 Carrie Smith a satyr the gap to coverage or stuff Albania superb only going 44 yards now it's at the 22 yard line of army a former Southern California star Frank Gifford about the talk games going on around the country as well as Army Navy USC Notre Dame and one of the biggest is all tied up its Oklahoma rated by many as a top team in the country and Oklahoma State at 10 apiece take it away Chris okay we have a first and 10 for the cadets from their own 20 to the local ease passed by John Hodges of Princeton New Jersey number 31 untie so late on that last place is a pretty standard wishbone pass play they got a one drive you see if he runs down and runs a fly pattern just speed break straight down the field his little play fake the fall is laid up and he's supposed to run under it this barely nice all right there will be a second out of 10 all army got to the near side of the field Howie Williams number 89 Tony daily number 83 and he's out for the army first down that's the best play against the flow that thing zone flow goes towards a fullback and the low Gleason sits up he's gonna flow right looks right sets and throws back a little curl in pattern to the other side very effectively done that's good executed their income and he curls up stays open and is it a very good timing that's a precision best play there mine traffic them not at all first and ten now from the 39 for the cadets 818 to go on the game number 31 John Hodges covered by John Sturges a freshman number 28 from Mountain View California at the base fly play just left over the left formation comes off the fake lays it up on a Spreaker try to get it down that sideline you need a big play now really big one alar play calling the signals he's thrown seven times completed four for 72 yards Daly has got three Woodcock Ortiz on their side of the field on second example 2:38 I'm out there as with Cochran stepping in the picture is done zone that time they're not being cooled alone a be settling back made almost a prevent type secondary getting good depth the big question because we have to go deep as though they're taking it in stride and while they can because their team leads by score of 19 to nothing north army turf over the third interception will be back this was the last pass watched the interception by Sturgis good field position body position rebounding take the balls as high as 50 point that's the way to intercept a man and now maybe has the ball first and 10 at their own 25 leading 19 to nothing with 806 left in the game Goodwin his fullback southern I think though itami Plymouth Hayden has really a good strong arm pretty although they haven't been a passing team of late but I think there'll be a lot of good Gilmore carrying on that place to Miller number 32 on the tackle they make a couple more first downs here it's going to be very very difficult we have any chance to win the body so it's going to be a down and four from the 31 maybe with the ball and the college division is we see the president again \u00e9poca is leading slippery Rock 27th of 14 epoca undefeated 90 this is the winner of this will go to the stack ball where they be seen next week Princeton goes to every table is he happy that's here at Gilmore another critical first down that means maintaining for this with the clock run around our spotter a native of Norristown Pennsylvania I think this is 450 third game with us temple his alma mater playing today so is nothing to cheer about six minutes 35 seconds remaining first in 10 now for maybe of the 36 yard line objection that time they said the strong side of for me right side of the field they came back to the short side as the army over shifted to meet that formation changed very effective move by the quarterback Navy using sound ground tactics to maintain position in the backfield for Navy with Cleveland Cooper out who's gained over 100 yards agains and and another armynavy game we have 22 Gilmore Jackson 38 Goodwin 42 Rebecca's 15 with and I mean is linked to the far side on second and six when a man wants back to my back fully aware that David is going to be trying to run the clock and run off that inside Georgie Welsh talking to the linesman on his side pointed about what's going on what's that clock to go faster I think I may be from coal down Pennsylvania just call to play to send it in Georgia an ex quarterback of course has a real solid foundation in tactical football he knows what he's doing out there right now a day that mr. Joffe eternal Penn State his third down at singing well they wanted the clock to run around stop let's go to bank Allison trope you to be announced later on this afternoon or maybe you'll be able to see two of the top contenders for that award USC's Anthony Davis and Notre Dame's Tom Clements immediately following why roller sports when we're moving to the Los Angeles Coliseum to watch John McCain's USC Trojans face era Four Seasons Notre Dame my Fighting Irish and one of the great traditional battles Chris house third down and 11 the bound remains the same Gilmore number twenty to thirty five to forty a stool Miller and 51 Greg Tyson make the tackle and we have four minutes and 41 seconds as we look at members night Academy jeonse double beam strong kicker number 21 Garrus heavy weights people when he gets that forward bounce on the kicks when they're not filled today really a couple times when he got magic incentives to get the ball away and a couple times it kicked on me way back deep in their own territory kicking really is vitally important especially in a possession type football game as this has turned out to be no American can help our Olympic cause this year by sending $5.00 to the United States Olympic Committee box 1976 Cathedral Station Boston zip 0 to 1 when they don't and Laban Hall the passive quarterback throws one number four thre icing so continuing with the Olympic address after you send five dollars and on sites Olympic Committee at box 1976 Cathedral Station Boston and appreciation you'll receive a colorful important attachment of writing America's participation in the 1976 winter and summer Olympic Games so on second of three freshmen number 16 that Lehman Hall carried on the play lost by handle much of the star at this game if you just join this with three minutes and 32 seconds left in the game the scoring started with a 45yard field goal by dykes then Jackson the three are touchdown let's look at that last way got gun even halt rolls against them prevent but he's not used to rolling out and carrying the ball he gets the good stuff in the ball dropped up George markoulis of Carson California recovers or they Vietnam cheerleaders atlas area it was intended for Robin a beam number 80 in the West day right move I guess the one whose songs away came out off after turn over though it's not a bad idea to go for broke psychologically the defense is usually not ready to play and and I think that that's indicated they'd been way after would choose a defensive player of the game on an offensive Clairol game as well it's going to be tough kind of has been very good today number ninety we're in the middle guard he in a losing cause he has played his heart out for me I can hit the road what a rush you put on him he has been out at second and ten of the 36 there is a great offensive star of those his teammate Cooper Jerry Goodman and the advance is to let's call it the 31 which brings up a third down and five with three minutes and ten seconds remaining in the ballgame darkens here the field lights were turned on at halftime just in case Sun has been shining throughout the afternoon maybe on third down conversions as only three of her emotion who scored the Navy touchdown now there's no doubt what Navy has the mind I don't know what they're doing here we go they could do almost anything they wanted a couple of different linemen come in tribe they made tore them let's see what they do try they gave it to the big guy Bob Jackson 231 it's watch the defense the defense is stacked in there it's a gap bait for all intents and purposes eight men up front all closing the gaps of the inside and it's not tackle slam which is the best play possible against that there we go they have the good deed going against that one got a holding penalty call against Navy I didn't think that was coming up did you no I didn't see it at all but a measurement will come first that'll give our me a chance to refuse it and maintain possession or else put them back 15 to make it 4th down again so they're fishes or heads up ball goes over all right the army defense done its job and this particular series of downs take over defining of course so for the cadets would it be nice seven quarters against like that it will give them a lift I mean they work so hard all right the play will come from the 26 first and 10 and the masked marvel of army they need to put him in the game the core team glory an option pitch from break my classmates to quarterbacks in the lineup well that's a razzledazzle when they do that a halfback pass as a run option but it was a pass all the way that time and it's a Dipsy doodle of work here though here is a fake to pitch back and lefthanders rolling out to his left it's not this kind of a wobbly didn't photograph too well but it's a completion here's a receiver Johnny Hodges out there he's a brilliant clever receiver he reads the problem gives a spin the outside gets open coming back and then gets out of bounds all right on the first down why hoping to pass was globally the thirdstring quarterback my Gliscor had gone out of the line as Tim Hardin that day a pack put the stop at the line of scrimmage there will be a second and 10 and there is Billy like a pilot I think look at those massive horns always pointing toward Navy's goal line maybe a beautiful place coming inside the 40 now maybe that's an evolving la feel clock is covered by fans one minute nine okay armies trying to move the ball any way possible to throw or get out of bounds they're getting close enough to try to get some points little pride in this world war show coming up job sports followed my notredame SC globally burned down in three trying hard was Tony daily that's really down deep against that prevent that's almost of what they call a victory defense now Chris they've got the Nate people back defending the past and two guys rushing and one protecting the drawing screen they have quite a challenge gotta get the points on the board and this is unusual after David came up with 17 points in the first half the only scoring and the second half was the safety but locally was tackled in the end zone all right walk down and three we have 46 seconds left in the diamond anniversary armynavy game Navy is in the lead 19 to nothing back again at JFK Stadium in Philadelphia Pennsylvania second in producer ABC sports an NCA Roone Arledge our game was produced today by Terry jestro as globally important today is it too hard a party has the first down is running out he got out of bounds to stop the clock and we have 39 seconds remaining we'd like to also on the back technical director producer Chris comedy engineering supervisor Burke Eric you know manager Murray Schwarz appreciate their help what footers are still trying they're doing everything you can to make a score because they want to think out of here where they put into a lot of effort they've had very few breaks they nice the Navy the Navy has not returned to the Navy very often so now with 39 seconds left in this Army Navy game it'll be a first and ten for the cadets at the Navy 27 we just received a final \u00e9poca as defeated slippery Rock 27 to 14 and they go to the Stackpole have you seen on ABC next week hey Chris even way out west in Colorado people know about slippery rock here at about 4:15 with other skating stars in wide world yes the boys died so tell me alright Olympic champion now first in 10 army Lehmann Hall Pass her by Dave payback and was the ball loose and what about was recovered by number number but time has been called by the cadets of army and had their problems today with five turnovers and here's a former Navy man President Gerald Ford Bob Caslon recovered the ball we'd like to read a letter we received from Seaver Peters athletic director of Dartmouth College determined the NCAA television committee it says congratulations are indeed in order the ABC television network for its outstanding coverage the college football scene during this season this is the ninth consecutive year that ABC has shared the great game of college football with its viewers as a matter of fact on the 23 years the NCAA has had a television package 12 have been with ABC when the 1974 season is over 70 different institutions from all three NCAA we'll have been exposed in regional and national telecast and this game is one of them down at 18 from the 35 ago army trying to get on the scoreboard and Bob Simon's ahem tackle by Dave payback oh that was a great play by faith back because there's only one of three in the primary zone letter goes on to thank Roone Arledge Chuck Howard and all the executives and announce of producers etc ABC so we'd like to thank City's favorite painters and the that nice pat on the back always nice to get back for that I'd like to congratulate you on a lovely job chris has really been fun these are my kind of people that's my kind of game we have a moment seconds to go in this game the world pepper layer the pungent player of the game as well all right Howie Williams is set to the far side on the third down and 17 from the 34 11 seconds to go rob Woodcock another potential receiver in the double wing formation going downfield too long 89 Howie Williams was out there we have four seconds left on the clock and some of the fans now are trying to get the goalpost to the left and the goal post on the right goes down well I don't think they wanted to kick a field goal anyway Chris that did you bring the people in and everybody gets involved in the nominating game and what players do you like offense and defensive awardwinners today well I think that the fact that Cleveland for the third straight armynavy game and he's an inspirational player and the navy of the victor because of that I think that the offensively and on defense the army Rickon up up front the nose guards a super job every play all the way for him Cooper 18 carries 106 yards a new herd is mentioned 91 Rick Connor so often the senior from Winter Park Florida so in his last game for the Black Knights of the Hudson I'm sure that he'll appreciate it as will his teammates the scholarship of $1,000 going into the general scholarship fund at West Point and the same is true of Cleveland Cooper $1,000 in the general fund of the United States Naval Academy that means a lots of those young men and I think they're appreciated very much when they go back home they've contributed just a little bit more than the average guy the right now is trying to escort or ask or remove fans the fans have removed both goal posts which this year in colleagues rather on the end line and they're down the crowd here today which included President Gerald Ford looking into the sunshine totaled eighty three thousand two hundred and forty seven the Midshipmen of the Naval Academy plenty to cheer about on the other hand it is a long gray for the cadets of the Hudson they're trying to clear that South the end zone because Army's going to try this Rose football into their that direction and they have to have all the room that they need there and that's only barely to get them out of there because even if there's only just one more play they deserve the perfect complete football at the game today Notre Dame Southern California at 5:00 Eastern Time preceded by International Skating stars from the garden including Janet Lim Dorothy Hamill Jordy McKellen and the 1956 gold medal so I did a surprise yes you tune in and watch edit button and I had the pleasure of doing it all right hi Williams and Bob will cap our set away on a fourth man just a few seconds for to go army has not scored in seven quarters against Navy in this Army Navy game there's one that's getting snow on it it's coming down it's up for grabs it's in the end zone as a woodcock number two but it bounced around off helmets hands and so and the diamond anniversary game our classic that began in 8 when they played to 45minute periods President Gerald Ford watching first over ladies on the army side and the game has ended it is a Navy victory again and they retain the commanderinchief trophy 19 or nothing so very usually they happy Midshipmen the brigade of Midshipmen term in Annapolis and in two years ago they have shut out the content of Army once

and both loss in their only appearance here tonight will be down here the southern part of the United States tonight but it's the most festive evening in the city of New Orleans as the mid winter sports committee has looked together another extravaganza thousands and thousands of people having come down from Nebraska thousands have come over from Florida and an awful lot of people who just wanted to come see a great football game have come including this very dapper young man to my ripe the head football coach at the University of Oklahoma and all you Oklahomans Nebraskans and folks down in Arkansas take just a moment to slap your knee here he is Barry Switzer I do Mary lace well your assistant head coach said he thought all members of the staff ought to have those four pregame dinners on Friday night oh they know I don't have this hanging in my closet home I have rented this yesterday and a guy for 40 about gotee bo Oklahoma those let's talk about the ballgame the Nebraska Cornhuskers an arch lab of the Oklahoma Sooners your team beat him this year but it's a good football team right and rescues always been a great football team they're a great tradition like the University of Oklahoma Keitha there lived by the great quarterback David from the allamerican who I'm very happy to see graduate this year he's a tremendous quarterback and that's one thing that Florida will have to continue with the night David hum is a great passer he throws well he sets up very quickly he gets rid of the ball extremely fast and he's got some fine receivers of throat especially Donnie Westbrook who is probably the closest thing they've had to Johnny Rodgers in a couple of years of course he only went there a couple years ago now Florida Ken Florida out of the wishbone moved the ball against this Nebraska black shirt of defense well I tell you you're gonna have success against Nebraska you don't have to move the football they are a big physical awesome football team I talked to the Florida coaches today Keith and they said without question this is the biggest football team that they've ever played they're huge upfront fine linebackers in the 230 class tall they're down people are 250 to 260 and and you got a long afternoon button these people out of there because it's a test for you and the key thing I think in the ball game is how will they block leave the nose guard kiss and the wishbone offense the harder your offense is the fullback play you've got to get a tie or stand off sometimes in those guard and win some time to move the ball consistently and of course how Florida plays defense to keep home from nibbling at him nibbling at him he doesn't get too hungry he just sits I've been picture a little bit of time well he first of all they do a great job with their offense they probably want the finest assister cated types of offenses in the country and they use a lot of various formations they move a lot of people around and home automatics quite a bit and the ball will have some more from Barry Switzer of Oklahoma later right now let's join the sea chatters out of Washington DC and the US Navy Band and a national anthem

from Akron Ohio so join us every this winner for the Professional Bowlers tour on most of these a belongs out of all with regard for Hector on the right side along with friend show on buchinsky number 88 will be the tight end they quarterback will be number 12 that's David Holm the lefthander Tony Davis at fullback 21 is Westbrook the wing back in the eye back with a deep man off the iformation John O'Leary he'll be alternating with Lonnie Anthony so they Nebraska Cornhuskers backing up at the white shirts with Dave Gillispie a sophomore out of Saratoga California and Don Westbrook call the beat men the Florida Gators will be kicking off and kicking for Florida it'll be number three David Posey he's five 658 pounder but he can't really put the foot on the ball there's the dangerous man right there number 21 Don Westbrook they're playing on artificial turf at 72 degrees in New Orleans Louisiana and the kick is high and in those to the goal line here comes the less be Donahoe breaks it open fine return now let's have a look at the defense for the University of Florida Gators down in front number 78 is Griffith and number 67 carpenter number 52 is Harbor defensive and picked up of three is Glenn Cameron number 43 makes the stop defensively for the University of Florida Talbot on the left number 28 as quarterback number 21 is Tyson Seaver number 24 is Alvin Collins and number 1 is Wayne second offensive players gonna put it up in the hurry let's go Westbrook most farm on the sidelines and Court it out about didn't complete fast and bring it back it'll be third down and seven and let's have an early comment from Oklahoma sooner coach Barry Switzer Keith their basic formation they came out first and ten they're the ice slot they'll do a lot of things from that Keith the second down there they came out to tight ends they did that against us with the wing set their course of playaction pass night tried to hit Westbrook and keep out alright third down and seven for Nebraska David concepts as he ran right by the handoff and Nebraska will have to punt down and nine so the short mustards are not able to move the football in their first offensive possession and that is a very important thing I think for the University of Florida the Gators are kind of chomping at the bit because they have been kind of put down as the definite underdog Alvin Cowens is the deep man legend less than doing the punting and a fair catch is called right at the 35 yard line for the University of Florida so here's your Florida offensive front now with Lima grip a little guy who will be the split in on the left side of the center it'll be Parker 7610 vo 7 to 7 kinds of Midland center lawless on the right number 6 before William 63 and Alice Garvey will be the fight in in the back vo for the Florida Gators it'll be Jeffy Donn captain overrated quarterback number 31 is James Richards number 35 is Jamie Debose and number 33 is Tony Green they come off the wishbone as he seemed to be struck with a moment of indecision as he came to the center of the line now let's set the Nebraska defense for you along the front it is 72 Mike bolts he's the biggest horse up there strongest man on the team number 69 up the middle there is John Lee the middle guard number 91 is Ron through it defensive tackle tom is number 16 yards on the play Jimmy burrow brought him down Cape vets not fair for wishbone team to run things to plays throw the first play of the ballgame the second to greet the wife the wide slot run the draw black playaction pass blocking on the left side as he was running behind Wallace and Williams and that's where they like to run it those two big guys and the trenches have done a fine job for the whole year first down and the game is down the 40yard line John Starkey bomb made the stop for Nebraska the rest of the corn Husker defense Tom Ruud is the strong line back at number 45 at Bob Nelson number 57 the weak side linebacker in the secondary it is number 26 wonderful Monsignor Jim Baro is number two Arnaud Johnson 29 and George Pharaoh's safety it goes Richards again and he slashes down to the Nebraska 36 yard line on second down and five they're looking now at a third down at about one to go and the Gators have come up breathing hard I bet they're not gonna throw bus guarantee they're gonna come right at you pretty impressive drive of Florida here they they haven't really run the triple option series yet but they've picked away at him and they've got some things going right now no the Provost thing of what they're doing I think they'll be gaiters and blue started on a 35yard plan ball goes to Tony Green number 33 and green who had moved into the left half back position for this game after having played right half did not get a whole lot as John Lee the middle guard stepped across fill the hole and decked in and let's have a look at the work of Lee John leaves the middle note that a nose guard here 69 he's got great strength he's 65 but 56 and he's gonna be a key for me no here's a play they run the inside belly to split in that's an unusual way for wishbone team right there it's 4th down in a short yard and the quarterback I think he's got it he pokes his helmet down to about the 35 yard line they didn't really have to go all the way to the 35 it'll depend on where they put it but I thought he is penetration might have carried him far enough they just play the ball game so far early in the game yep be a mini big plays during volume is going to be close here to Barry tell you Barry Switzer of Oklahoma is our guest commentator tonight as ABC presents live and in color from New Orleans a 44 41st annual Sugar Bowl football classic didn't make it they missed it by no more than two inches well he stuck his head in there but he wasn't able to move the football and so I'm wearing the sign of cotton look for it when you want to feel comfortable when you see it on towels you can count on him to be really soft and thirsty when you see it on sheets they'll be fresh and comfortable like shirts jeans jackets natural cotton makes you comfortable so when you're looking for comfort look for the sign of cotton the more cotton the better you I'm wrong person and you know it's time for the guy just can't smoke and that's when I'm glad I've got scope it's smokeless tobacco gives you real like a pleasure but you don't lie that you just take a pension put it between your cheek and gum and it sure feels relaxing in there and man I need something to help me relax for tobacco pleasure without smoking millions of guys use skull Copenhagen and happy days we look down on the sugar bowl here in New Orleans from the airship Mayflower the Goodyear blimp Don best connect and cameraman bill Sullivan up there providing them spectacular picture that's one of four the airships floating around over the world and the Nebraska Cornhuskers just outside their 35 yard half the football first down spread formation Lord it was six men up front and off goes to Tony Davis the fullback penalty flag is on the field as Davis works his way to about the 33 yard line Sammy green the nose guard for the blue shirt and Florida Gators jumped in there to make the stop number 99 see him clapping his hands and the call is going to go against the Huskers for holding take this moment to introduce the rest of our cast and they too are splendidly attired on this festive evening in New Orleans evening wears along Mary O'Neill was with us a statistician injury client is our spotter we have two tight ends in there right now for Nebraska machine ski and Brad chickens he recovered Preston convicted 90 really laid some leather on him and some of the numbers on these two teams for the seasons gives you an idea that certainly both of them are capable of moving the football but particularly Florida on the ground Gators have not gone to the pass with the frequency of Nebraska keep Evan interested for defense against the rushing game the sidelines at about 38 39 yard line picks up 15 yards on the play that is short however the first down because the Cornhuskers have to go to their 46 for the first down oh they're going to be looking at a third down and about seven yards to go what 8 yards to go third mate so on 30 long rich ball comes wide to the right side for what should it Modesto that's a big play right there um hat is he's I'm a cold area or in that particular alignment is slotback O'Leary loo on the short pattern but instead tried to go deep he sprinted into the founder the weak side of this Creek Formation tried to throw back in the deep furrow all the way across the field that by forcing corner squatter didn't cover the third they're playing five short unit 15 to cover deep deep and the corner just squatted on it made a great play stepped inside of it and I felt all along and particularly and I think probably being a wishbone technician as you are coach the most important thing for a wishbone team is to get out in front keep these guys whites right run the peel back draw the green one slide right right here they just the draw blade drops back into the ball at the fullback lead draw playing green as a great runner he's a fivespeed knocks the extra point through we'll have another look at that touchdown play the Gillette track two razor gets people genuinely excited listen if my wife took the track two away from me I think it would be grounds for divorce track choose a streaker cuz it's so smooth just one person it's all gone it was like no other experience I had ever had a shaving well I believe in the track to the first blade cuts it second blade cuts it even lower it's a tremendous idea and everyone the Gillette track two shaving system the closest thing to a perfect shave this is Don Rickles open this door this yoyo is gonna wish he was still the mail boy listen pal you're right that antiperspirant is wrecking my act everyone knows I make a living insulting people I make them sweat but this hockey puck helps keep him dry with his right guard with his super dry anti stain formula right God protects people from me open up you dummy I bet he sits there all day with his right guard going this Sunday ABC's Wide World of Sports 4:30 Eastern 3:30 central and Pacific times we'll be bringing you the heavyweight championship fight Muhammad Ali's eighth round knockout victory over George Foreman the champion will be with me in the studio analyzing the fight as it took place giving his inner feelings during the course of the bout also on the same show the second annual World Series of auto racing this Sunday Wide World of Sports 4:30 Eastern 3:30 central and Pacific Times all right Florida will kick it off Posey will kick to Gillespie and Westbrook the kick is short bouncing over the head of Gillespie Wiggles into the end zone and the Resta will have it first down at their own 20 yard line and now let's have a look at that touchdown run by green his fine run here here's the fullback lead draw he blocks the defensive tackle the fullback green makes her cut the outside here he's got the four or five speed shows him running ability he bounces that side here Nebraska Pete Benson uses his speed right here you think good guys got an angle on him but he didn't did it he's only a freshman alright Nebraska domani Anthony who is another brilliant freshman running back here at the line of scrimmage cut off the stack worked his way to the 24 Anthony was the big 8 newcomer of the year in the big 8 conference he was rushed for about 600 yards freshman yard braska he was the you come on our league plan football player Darryl carpenter 67 Vernon barber 52 pinched on the tackle Tom Osborne the Nebraska coach on the sidelines Florida Kendrick number 90 Gasca third possession no they've been impressive both ways offensive Lily moved into position interception now that their defense played the probably a more consistent than their office fine both teams play the basic five to go for my friend deep in 48 minutes and 45 seconds to go in the first quarter Florida leading seven third down in five yards to go for her breasts the fullback Davis I haven't on his clothes he's a tough little guy I woke up to him he looks like a little baby face sort of a guy who'd be sitting up in a tree trunk looking over the fence at a ball game and he picked up the first time but I'll tell you he'll stick his head in there against anybody you know he was the tailback last year Keith he rushed over a thousand yards and moving fullback this year that give him added dimension they didn't have a runner to her back last year they felt like this certainly would help them having the two high backs O'Leary and Anthony with the firstborns have put on the board by Florida first launch award against the recipe into the first quarter all season so the Gators in need to fight Otto Mears Harmon trouble sex architect rosette feat melito respect their passion complete and I'll tell you Randy tell but if he's been able to looked up at the lights and find the football when I had his second interception now let's join Jim Lampley Tony green may have been one of the best freshman running backs in the country this year but a year ago in Florida coaches recruited him they had no idea they were getting a great running man he played high school ball at Sarasota Florida in an offense that was all passing and he only carried the ball about four or five times a game first game this year over 150 yards Keith that's laryngitis Jim they're second down and ten Tom threw that ball 61 yards in the air is going to put it up again hasn't kidding right names you drop that and Keith come through that one in there Alvin Butler 38 defending for Florida the Gators are in the blue shirts and the coinvestment wearing the white at Florida leaves 759 to go at the 1st quarter 7 to nothing 21 yard spread by freshman and back Tony green the play was set up by interception by Wren to tell but just a moment ago had a very good chance at his second intercept of the game and couldn't find the ball the last second all right it's third down and 10 for Nebraska ball comes one to the right and the pass to the sideline drop that one apparently didn't hold it or else caught it out of bounds so the rest will have to punt it tom is one for six 16 yards in the ballgame so far in the books in Florida who made the trip to New Orleans left I imagine several hundred thousand or million Florida fans over this country liked it as well alright dropping back is Alvin Cowan's number 24 Randy Lessman number 39 a sophomore at a Sioux City Iowa to the funding for Nebraska that's a lot of heat gets his kick away Cowens gonna bring it up call fair catch 34 yard punt that's below his average of 39 + 36 yardline Florida has it first down Gators lead Nebraska 7 to nothing oh hi America hey we were just gonna make a commercial for you about your favorite midsize car Chevelle hey what are all those gas cans ah that's how much less gas you could need to go 50,000 miles with a 75 Chevelle v8 then you need it with a 74 chiffon yep EPA urban mileage test results which emphasize stop and ghost city type driving show a 75 Chevelle v8 got 28 percent better gas mileage than a 74 and GM proving ground tests of suburban type driving showed a 22 percent increase so even using the more conservative figure that could abound to a gas savings of 801 gallons for 50,000 miles or about four years average use you said 801 gallons that's very good 801 gallons it'll be interesting now to see what defensive changes Nebraska might make against Florida since the Gators have come out of with some surprising moves out of the wishbone formation Gaffney is the quarterback DuBose number 35 is in their source Richard Richard big boy he's stronger and bigger than the arena would appear and of course green after wishbone with McGriff split wide to the left side yesterday keeps the ball coming around the option for the Cornhuskers I tell you what they're gonna do Keith are going good day and they said it'd be quick to go through the pass and I'm sure that they're gonna come back a few minutes the poster out trying to beat that safety supporting inside out well in the first place Cairo said not that tall to zone two five nine and if he is coming up he's leaving a hole back there somewhere it knee that's right inside the Tony green and green going from the 36 out to the 39 for about three yards before Tom 868 and run through it 91 make the stop for Nebraska now about the Nebraska defense sits in the same formation right as we take a look at rule here's the basic play of the wishbone offense here Keith the linebacker going the outside is trying to take the quarterback in this case and we have a fine block with a freshman the quarterback so Derby the tight end makes a great grab and get it put it on the money he was right in between burrow and Kairos Darby is 6 6 to 19 were with 6 footer in Paros 5 9 by the bullwhip DuBose number 35 and so Florida continues to move the football you're talking about Cairo is not being very large player you know lead McGriff practicing on the sidelines that's the first time I've seen that hammering the balding Tucker style you'll wear that out for the gays over here for the whole thing alright a second down your should know the Fichtner Richards on a sweet look defensive flow this time as a fruit and paint went with a blade and they got Richards after a yard they run in place I've never seen a wishbone they run a quick pitch this obviously got Tom Osborne his folks turning around all those out nice do he run a kind of wide open wishbone here we've got five minutes and 25 seconds to play in the first quarter the football is sitting at the 27 yard line I'm gonna call it third down in a short eight number eight Don gap through the Florida quarterbacks Epson oh no he gets in trouble now john lee number 61 got his bad but help from fate number 68 they fetched in and lead came from the other side he lost four yard it'll be fourth down get to see the gap kicking something else besides nip here and it'll be a pretty good wallop because it's gonna be a 48yard field goal try buster morrison will hold it and David Posey a sophomore on a booklet on there wasn't partially block didn't get enough Andre so with four minutes and 33 seconds to play in the first quarter the referee Earl sjostrom out of the big 8 conference waves it off s no good and the Florida Gators lead in the football game by a score of 7 to nothing look here now are the work of lead number 69 coming out of that middle guard position for Nebraska getting a good pass rush folks leave fine play right here the lead 69 and here comes John O'Leary at first and ten at the 20 yard line on the I back gets no more than a yard as he runs in between sammy green 99 with 78 and darryl carpenter 6 to 7 the middle for 4 they Florida defense the hula bowl comes up before Eastern Time this Saturday on ABC and boy if we've got a Ruster for you in that one for example the East quarterbacks will be conned rich Holloway of Tennessee and Dennis Franklin of Michigan the West that made the USC as Steve I'll tell you more later suck it down nine yards to go to basket he's at the 30 31 yard line first down for mr. Wayne fields brings him down a junior out of Gainesville and the guards all word Hector and the middle man punished the center helped him get loose for the 10 yard pickup they're gonna have to have some success in the running game gets a yard as he tries to slant the left side Florida getting very good defensive flow from the front man Vernon Barbour 50 to make that stop here's Don Tollefson wit miss Vince Ferragamo when next year may very well be the starting quarterback from Nebraska transfer from Kalin has to sit out this entire year Finch what should we look through from your offense here in the first quarter now well they've been working on about 50/50 run pass so I don't know it probably isolation for the best running play in practice you duplicated the Florida often playing the role to Florida quarterback why do you think they were able to move the ball so well on your defense why I guess they have to you know have a little chance to loosen up a little bit you know they're a little bit tight right now and they just got lucky on a cold play that's all that's lucky next year Thank You Keith Thank You Don Vince Ferragamo transferred to Nebraska from California he is not eligible to play we're not talking with a man who's involved in the game that I'd accept from the standpoint of interest he will and go into spring practice and the fair likely could be the starting quarterback for the next year good third down and eight yards to go for the Cornhuskers the ball is up outside the 31 Thomas missed five straight passes now David's got it in the air again throws and the pass is incomplete pass intended for Chuck Milito number 89 he had to come back for it it was too low so now David Hahn is 1 4 8 16 yards so far in the first quarter 254 to play I think that was an automatic thing Keith you might have noticed eighth home took a little longer at the line of scrimmage today and I think he audibled and I think even if he had caught the vaad caught the pass it would not been enough for a first down it came a little short Alban Cowan's 2480 found sophomore out of Alexandria Virginia deep wearing the blue shirt for the Florida Gators the man to do the punting is Randy Lessman for Nebraska gets it all that's a good want to hang it up there and float it a little bit here comes Cohen's up on one knee at the 30 yard line that's a 37 yard but a little closer to his average and back down field we have a penalty flag flag thrown back around the 35 yard line and they're coming back he's talking do they Florida defensive captain number 55 is Ortega they can punt it again the referee is Earl Sjostrom the umpire is Harvey Hardy the head linesman window Winkler the field Judge Joe Delaney the line judge duck Moseley the back judge is already forked on the clock operators do slavery and a 1 another shot at it thinking perhaps they might get a run back as a la Nebraska draws a 5yard procedure call Snap is on the money lessman's kick is not too long balance Mayo at the 30 for goodness sakes alive and he took a walk they had to return on then keep the last been a pressure situation they tried to block him they had to return on that time they were only rushed 5 people made him put on the rhythm tried to set the wall up rich Duda the man who hit him 37 yards on the fun watch due to number thing to come in here let some stick right here get a good job just hold on the ball right all right it's at the 34 yard line for Florida first down Gaffney is your quarterback on the option down the line delivers it outside and it is Larry and Princeton number 39 of 206 pounds sophomore out of print out of my any carry and of all Brinson has started some of the games this season fact most of the games but has had a leg injury and it looks like Green number 33 is down and shaken up on the play it's not a leg somebody might a knock some of the wind out of him he was the lead blocker on that play key that Weston would make the block on the floor and it made a fine run there picked up eight yards they've been able to move the ball consistency rushing game shirt here so Tony Green will come out and get pumped up it'll be second down and along to the Florida where the football is sitting out just alright the 42 yard line two minutes and 15 seconds to play in the first quarter and Florida leading by a score of 7 to nothing Tom Osborne on the right wearing the headset head coach of the rest Nebraska figured to be about a twotouchdown favorite coming into the ball game handed off to the first man out of the wishbone formation the fullback and he carries it for the first down as he reaches the 46 yard line DuBose behind Stanfield Wallace and Pines been all Florida so far Keith and very impressive it's a pretty decent average for those back to starting backfield it'll make a bunch of first downs right there the ball inside again I thought that might have been almost loose the play went into the line but Bob Martin Mike folks were right there to jump on the ball carrier and DuBose apparently had a pretty good grip on it Florida's had their problems with fumbles all over the year when you're running out of the wishbone and out of the beer and some of these formations where the ball is moved in the last second the quarterback Gaffney held on until the very last second and then delivered the ball outside the Brunson and Brunson is down to the Nebraska he may be inside the 45 gain of about eight yards on the play it'll be close to a first down let's have a look at Tom route 45 right here Ruth makes a fine play on the founder here Kyros 8t supported inside out and hit the quarterback he made a fine pitch the halfback made a good run up the boundaries the crew had to stop in here makes a fine tackle seems all the way to the boundary you're giving too much yardage Jill when Drew's got a come across the field make a play that deep down founder they're getting too much they've got to stuff that and they did get a first down out of it the ball is at the Nebraska 44 yard line as David hummus preps on the sidelines Oh steps out of it now he goes down put 91 got it so you take away fruit and guess you might have run for most of the night grunts got him from the leg back up a 48 yard line that's a long four maybe five five let's call it second down 15 well they still haven't gone to that wide receiver for grip yet the fat in on the ground green back in the lineup he advances the ball down for the 46 yard line if they keep averaging four have yards of that play keep we're going back and the quarter there are moments in everyone's life when your future unfolds before you and Metropolitan Life can help you prepare for it sunshine which were life together the future will be here in a moment don't let it take you by surprise at Metropolitan Life we've spent over a century helping people prepare for the future and Metropolitan can do the same for you Metropolitan Life where the future is now what I have this friend Ron is a very different in mine and uh we met when I was are playing with the Celtics and uh he was pretend he was a basketball player and has to play and he'd watch him we became friends because I admired the way he watched he masqueraded as a player coach then I was the coach of the team it can now be revealed for the first time he's always the same crazy good friend zipper keeps so keep in touch long distance is the next best thing to being there completed Princeton and Brinson trying to run before he got ahold of the handle he had some room to he might have got this first he probably got enough that's gone on fourth down right there Keith they've been in four down zone I think you've probably been inside to 30 35 yard line alright burrow number two drops back Jimmy burrows junior out of Amory Mississippi into the funding it's custom artisan number nine the Gators he gets the ball from his 48 yard line and it is filled it's short line abreast of win 30 yard clock seven yard return the first quarter statistics hightorque mark tied off to number 22 39 yards Nebraska they've got to do more than that let's see what they do in this quarter here at Keith that was all Florida the first quarter star the second was to a reskin turning around here you're gonna have to David Homme it just they just handle him so far he hasn't been able to find one man open all night actually he did he's hit two yet the ball dropped on one occasion 22 yard line they take it up the middle running right in behind Hector a word and Crenshaw and it's Westbrook number 21 Westbrook is a tough guy coming back on a little counter inside very tough we'll probably see him later on keeps running reverse he ran a reverse 40 yards on a touchdown drive against us and we'll see that I'm sure before the half problem ball is at the 27 yard line it's second down and five for Nebraska Anthony the tailback to the 30 outside to the 31 he's going to be a yard shy of his first down here's done many college football players are fine students but few of any can equal the dual performance of Nebraska's Monty Anthony's on the field and in the classroom Monty Anthony is the first freshman in modern history to start for Nebraska he was the leading ground gainer for him this year meanwhile in the classroom Lee was piling up 27 semester credits while excelling in difficult courses like calculus chemical engineering and computer science Keith got pinked up is the first time that Nebraska is run pleased and second him down in the ball game is first three rushes they've had in a row and they got some results out of it Rick threw a big block in the middle on green here just sealed him off behind block pitch sweep me Waldo everything off the outside first down Cornhuskers Florida 48 yardline Florida leading 7 to nothing starting the second quarter of play looks the West roll short it's intercepted intercepted by Kendrick the defensive end so a wider leg defensive end was in the right place at the right time rotate back 17 yards in Florida back in business boy I tell you what that takes something out of you right there here they move the football for about 30 yards and we come up with first and 10 throw the interception there hey what Florida is flame lights out right now great job on people hum 1 4 9 16 yards to interception great field position he'll take this chance for down zone here come out of four times don't throw the green chips into the middle of 30 yard line three yards pick up John Lee 69 principal tech ler for Nebraska 12:47 to go at the first half and Florida leading 7 to nothing doc Dickey moved back to his alma mater a very successful tenure at the University of Tennessee second down and seven Gators Tony green fumbles the football Nebraska got it they say even after seven to nothing there are maybe six million skiers in America but only a handful who can do it like this being really good at anything has never been easy the Budweiser people understand that too they're making sure that Kari isn't just a memory 100% cotton shirts and jeans are Saturday morning comfortable and cool a cotton shirt is Saturday night comfortable and elegant cotton is a quiet weekend warm and cozy cotton is a business meeting when you could be hot under the collar but you're not because cotton breathes 100% cotton the shirt and jeans fiber when you're looking for comfort look for the sign of cotton the more cotton the better you feel 26 seconds to play in the first half and David Hanson white shirt at Nebraska to the attack again as our Dale Johnson recovered Tony Green's fumble is the deep man Tony Davis is the short man Larry and O'Leary patients waited for a moment and turned into the middle of the line and wiggled for the better part of three yards Sammy Greene made the stop 99 here is a look at his work isolate on the nose guard here both the playing will in the ballgame Lee and green here's the fine play on the Sprint draw to the leering makes the cut back and center over plays on the outside and green to pull the block second down seven yards to go for the Cornhuskers I'm Long Count may have checked off that you still O'Leary 35 36 yard line he'll be about a yard short of his first down as well Ortega number 55 brought him down third one I bet they don't though here Keith well based on the stats in the game so far it would seem an unlikely thing considering the back david holmes missed the last seven passes he had one for the play though all right Westbrook coming into the slide on the left side they're tied on the right Lord remove six men up now seven pitch it out to O'Leary turns it back in gets his first down penalty flag at the 40yard line penalty flag is thrown out of the defensive secondary by the official the game was enough for the first down as cliff Griffith the seen you out of Baker Florida number 78 made the stop for the Gators we might have a facemask ball here you know Barry I sort of like the rules the pros have in this if it's an unintentional less painful right that's the discretion call it official you know that can depends on who they callin on us or their opponent well it's it's a thing that sticks out there it's very easily if you're grabbing for somebody to get a finger or hand hooked at it that's right it's automatic in college football the first great worry is injury nobody wants to get hurt about that necro head its first down Nebraska after 45 yard hit hard popped it up and Wayne feels recovers for Florida there he is number one here's a look at the linebacker 43 Cameron who knocks the ball loose he makes a fine play they run their first he starts one way with the flow that has to go back comes off that block and makes the tackle and there goes the ball it was a fumble and force has a big play for Florida like Preston might be willing to take that one empty just when the Cornhuskers were getting it together they cough it up Florida has it first down at their own 28 yard line gives the ball to do both the bull back out of the wishbone slants it up to the 34 yard line for closer to noon to 6 yards on the play 11:09 to go in the first half Starkey Ballman H make the stop Nebraska turned it over three times now you're making too much of first and ten second down long for here's a sweep of Tony Green number 33 runs out of the grasp of Stark a bomb plate put him away out near the 38 yard line a little bit short on this first down right in between the hash marks 37 38 let's call it third down another yard seven South even Southeastern Conference turns it inside and gets his first down as he reaches the 42 before Tom pate makes another tackle for the Cornhuskers but he does get outside and is able to make his cut he's got pretty good quickness he's only rushed 488 yards this year after losses in a wishbone that's not much yards for a wishbone quarterback but he's got the quickness and speed that you want to look for in that position punching hey makes the stop for Nebraska they probably run that play morning he play decedent he bets the lead draw play fullback lead and a half back on the bar open formation and hate so 48 and 68 are making the bulk of the tackles right now for Nebraska and Florida is gonna be looking at third down and long all is that's a 48 yard line near the 48 of Florida and it'll be third down and five yards to go stick down for Nebraska they've got to stop them here and not allow them get any more field decisions gonna have a long way to go Kathy puts it in the air the bullets left backwards and it's an incomplete hard pass and Dover tying up in the air ten yards to go at about the 18 yard line 35 yards on the kick but very good hang time eight minutes and 43 seconds to go in the first half but the Florida Gators still eat it seven to nothing teen yard line a little bit closer to the 18 of the 17 they trailed 7eleven 843 to go in the first half and hung pitches to Anthony honest gets it inside he's out first to the 25yard line Lynne Cameron 43 on the stop from Florida the two guys had made that play work where Crenshaw 73 and Hector 64 on the right side of the offensive line sweep spent the best played for a Nebraska so forth see if they run to the tidy and end the slot slot side that Westbrook went the wrong way home had to call him over the other side or they whipped it in trouble kazi's the key block sweet second down and two Oscars trailing haters in the middle goes up to about the 28th should have a first down here's down telephone inside of which team who wants to play for next year the press conference is going on right now and at that press conference hunter is expected to announce his decision we'll have details for you later on during the telecast of tonight's Sugar Bowl Keith thank you down that means old fat fish get on back this huh all this talking first down Laura Nebraska at the 28yard this time davis acidify image butts up Tony holds his way over the right side for three maybe four yards before they can get it but Keith and the breast has had three turnovers having it yep we turn over they gotta stop helping Florida Florida doesn't even help the way they're playing they've got to start helping themselves Bach comes in number 24 at a wide receiver position now all advanced from the 28 of the 32 it will be second down and six for Nebraska and rich becomes wide to the left Westbrook is up in the wing back position left side but Florida smelled of cumin hidden field often played it very well as Preston convicted he refused to give on it taste the plate on the sidelines they played that play the way we did against Nebraska Keith the Hendrick goes to the strong side he was lined up on the slot side and he keyed the wing back the wing back delayed and were started to reverse to the weak side and he chased me ran with him down the line of scrimmage and made the play from behind you got enough speed your defensive ends that's a great way to play the reverse we in this case being the Oklahoma Sooners because you're listening to the comments of our guest commentator Barry Switzer the head football coach at Oklahoma third down three yards to go Hendricks got it again the ball was batted in the air by one of the defensive linemen and then Kendrick snatched it up and that's the third interception of the night and Kendricks second here I talked to Kinney head fielder's defensive secondary coach before the game today Keith and he told me this guy right here is a fine fine football player and he's proved that the night he's made two big plays they say you run the 40 in about four 70 weighs about 1 to 30 finally Jimmy Fisher number 10 comes on the field at quarterback now for the Florida Gators first time we've seen Fisher he is the better passer of the two florida quarterbacks 6 28 to go the first half the Gators leading 737s Tony green to the 35 so Fisher number 10 is in there for the first time he is a sophomore out of temper as David harm on the sidelines you know he must be ready to start mumbling to himself where things are going and been his nine so far Keith they vent port they went in the Battle of the tunnel as they don't forward to Florida's one floor to say great field position second down seven yards to go for the Gators fumble this year fresh quarterback comes in fumbles the ball and covers it s Kendrick well you know how I say peasant head he successful on the ball tonight but he said some bad things happened if they pressured me pretty good and they've had two balls deflected batted up in the air the cause two interceptions here and I know he said close the line of scrimmage and they're just getting too many people close to him to make him throw poorly right now got a good fee per or protect but it was a great rush by Tom tape number 68 and number 72 Mike folks you know Nebraska is playing good defense keep that had the great pressure put on him they've had bad field position when it played extremely well forced him to punt into into this field position but there are fans has been so inconsistent with the turnovers that just haven't give themselves a chance with that early campaign borough number two is deep down for Nebraska and Buster Morrison number nine no rush at all he kicks it behind the ear angles it for the corner if he gets the right kind of a bounce it bounces back into the field of play and bounces dead and his foot down at the Nebraska nine yard line 34 yard punt we have 441 to go in the first half in Florida still leads to Alaska seven to nothing 1956 hundreds of grooves are cut right into airport runways grooves to help channel away water and improve traction on wet surfaces 1966 to help prevent water from building up under automobile tires grooves are cut into freeways because the less water under your tires the more traction you get and now Goodyear introduces the new poly steel radio Bigfoot with eight wide grooves specially designed to help improve traction in the rain ain't white grooves that help prevent water from building up between the road and the tire by helping to channel it away Bigfoot with double steel belts and a high traction rubber that really grips on roads wet or dry get the tire that keeps its feet even in the rain Bigfoot the new poly steel radio only from Goodyear the football has been placed right on the 10yard line where in Nebraska again with Barry and for the field position we'll try to get something going for 41 to go in the Florida leading 7 to nothing um bitches the border O'Leary Cameron 43 right on the old breastbone nails him with a sullen tackle as he gets it up to the 15yard line he's done the speculation has finally come to an end this spring catfish hunter will be wearing the pinstripes of the New York Yankees gunner who played such a key role in those Oakland World Championships signed a fiveyear contract with the Yankees you'll earn a reported 3.7 million dollars it's better than curry point seven million dollars for five years that is absolutely mindboggling good three well more power to it football now in the possession of Nebraska is at the 18 yard line and it's third down and two right here I can't either I just can't believe it I guess if anybody around the game of baseball ought to have it catfish would be the man but he probably means twenty four wrap him out of beat Gary Higgs the fullback came into that hole first knocked it open they're gonna get through it's been their best play to pitch sweeps of the slot of the tidy and I believe they're automatically quite a bit fifth lady if they did not come does a lot of the line of scrimmage you know Florida's field position can break this half they've had them all to 33 into 37 in this quarter but they didn't score they come back to the game's over first down Crenshaw named Marvin penalty flag on the field watch him 73 73 face block he goes low to scrambling here and Illyria does a fine job of bouncing outside he was gonna run the isolation off a counter play off tackle but he found outside the containment fine run got a penalty in the meantime that penalty flag thrown back there at they indicated holding didn't I mr. Keith must be offsetting penalties welcome back for a second and nullifies a fine ten yard effort by O'Leary so it's offsetting penalties still at the 23 10 minutes 28 seconds to flips it inside the Westbrook Westbrook levels and gets I'll tell you that play that would just scare me right they've already threw two interceptions five yards the line of scrimmage and they want to run to Utah fast that make you nervous he throws it right into a crowd but when it works it works but there's a lot of folks in there reaching and grabbing for that ball learnt her of course he could've gone 80 yards for a touchdown to have been a great play great call okay what we put in that call that one shoe that goes back to Jack Curtis Takeo he is bunch of guys a long time ago head that way 250 to 300 second down and ten no gain on that Higgs bull backfires to cut it back over the left guard and gets to the 25 maybe the 26 you think Davis has hurt the reason he's not playing fullback Tony Davis I'll tell you I saw this I've seen Nebraska twice during the regular season and then 206 bounce up pull right up to lead all the times I've seen him rather impressive athlete I don't believe he played in that ballgame makes it he delivers it to Baba 33 yard line maybe short of that if he's at the 33 he's got a first down but it's going to be close enough I suspect that the change will have to come all the way across the beat two minutes and one second to play in the first half on the 41st annual Sugar Bowl football classic here in luolian okay that's what make coach it makes coaching nervous right there at heck of a business keep and Louet football around they can run it over there measure that first I've been moving around ball boy I ran over a blue ball time is called by Florida and it is not did Florida call time he indicated yep so time is taken here as the Nebraska Cornhuskers were about a foot short of their first down with 201 to go in the first half so proud sitting in the Sugar Bowl surprised as Florida continues to lead 70 America Merrill Lynch is bullish on America we believe America's economy has the strength to endure hard times and come back even stronger investments for a changing economy regular news on conventional and unconventional investments for today's economy call for your FREE copy bullish on America look for Delco batteries in more cars on more corners fourth down and maybe a little more than a foot to go and the rest is gonna get rid of the ball as Lessman comes in to punt and Cowan's goes deep the Florida I could take Infante Bearcats call by Cowens back that is 29 yard line there the Gators will have it 38 yards on the punt Randy had a little bit of trailing win that's hand and help consign and so here come the Gators now with a minute and 54 seconds to play in the first half first down at their own 20 9 and Gaffney comes back at quarterback for Florida I have the feeling berry that's a duck dick you might have just put Fisher in on that last series to warm him up a little bit get a taste of it in case he had to go to him later I think they're going to try to score here 34 5 yards on the play he got out of bounds to stop the clock at 147 to go in the first half force Nebraska will be laying off their teeth but I would think they'll take a shot at just try the deep route Street route fly out here post something to wideouts we're using the flanker set to bring in half back over to lie down Richard Greene and fourth period it was a solid hitch as Green tried to cut it back over the left guard and number 91 run through it from captain California really popped in with John Mackay the head coach of the Southern California Trojans and OJ Simpson will be joining me at the hula bowl on Saturday and 4:00 Eastern Time on ABC's Wide World of Sports on the most of these ABC station Gaffney gets it all this has been played to McGrath the little speedster he goes back to the 31 yard line if he just stayed on his feet and taken it out of bounds you discover the clock I picked up a little more yardage to gain 35 on that one you know this guy's only five foot nine here Keith him was a walkon in Florida and he leads the Southeastern Conference with 36 reception a wishbone receiver leads to good the Southeastern Conference and pass receive fine run kits by here put the threepoint range deep it's green hooking it in the middle from the 31 to the 28 maybe the 27 and it's both fullback and I'm looking to see Florida with two more timeouts remaining Nebraska with all three of Bears remaining or two remaining two remain Doug Dickey on the sidelines with this quarterback Don get me this is a time where young men tests themselves and that department called poise coaches too huh very yeah we've kept getting we got test pretty good Aaron and I had one at Nebraska this year we fumbled a kickoff their leading 14 to 7 and Elvis peacock who fumbles the ball in the 15yard line we facing 21 to 7 in the third quarter he'll intestine but they didn't get we took the drive 180 got it 1414 150 seconds to go in the first half and get me coming back into the huddle now 1976 Olympics will soon capture the attention of the world in America's very finest athletes will be competing as members of the US Olympic team is our every American can help send five dollars to the US Olympic Committee Vox 1976 Cathedral Station Boston Massachusetts 0 to 1 1 8 all right it is second down six yards to go he's good man McGriff it's knocked away at the very last second by Jimmy Moreau you bet he made a super play good gosh crossing route from the Griff again the 5 foot 9 160 pound walk on crosses the field and a deep crossing route you'll see Bharat's a touchdown right here go it in there here's Burrell picking him up coming across steps in front of him lays out great play that's on the 3yard line he catches that in the first half 17yard Gallup on the play and the man who let it was the sinner Jimmy Tynes who got off the snap of the ball and really opened that door that's a great run by DuBose he doesn't look as big as he runs he's 218 pounds jr. but he'd around all the people that time kind of fullback you need the wishbone some big gag hammer up inside and get that tough yards you got to have the speed and quickness then but break the long view those guys around all right Florida has now spent its last timeout Gators have no more remaining only 39 seconds to play so they've got time for maybe two plays before they go for three they lead seven to nothing four turnovers have hobbled that the Cornhuskers in the first half there's an old adage around the game of football you turn it over six times and you're lucky if you leave with your shirt well you know even with the turnovers you can't take anything away from Florida Keith because I think the sport be what it is right now without the trim where they played Florida's played outstanding with the entire first half and I've been very impressed with him I didn't think they could play that way against Nebraska but to tell you the truth not just because I coaching the big conference I've been extremely impressed with all right destiny is coming back he's probably coming with a couple of plays here he might fall a couple in the huddle I try to go with the second play with know the football is marked down for the record at the 11 yard line first down for Florida at the Nebraska 11 only 39 6 remaining on the clock in the first half break the wishbone and swings to performers we're green is wide to the right gets away from one he's got prepared from the end zone if he can find yard lighting the worst my clothes number 72 they got no more timeouts remaining it's a 40yard field goal now instead of having a chip shot it's got to go 40 yards closes got it up in the air it's good so David Posey go from 40 yards out and on the two seconds to play in the first half and Florida jumps to a Tantra living lead here on that last play they paddle Gaffney too soon I think waiting scram a little bit more keeping watch what might have been on that last play Darby 88 is the tight end he's the one had caught that long pass earlier he puts him back fell down sure wide open when he had people harassing him he had scrambled and McGriff on the other side had gone to the post and then gone come back to the right corner and he was free he's open at whole time fighters trying to get the quarterback down that's right hos heroes it on the ground time gone play continues as Tony Davis brings it back up to the 49 yard line and the first half of plays and we have a surprise at halftime the University of Florida Gators lead the Nebraska Cornhuskers ten into nothing here's Jim Lampley coach Doug Dickey of the Florida Gators you're up ten to nothing and you probably controlled the game even more completely than that I think you have to be pleased well we've had great field position Jim and our defense has played really well so far not giving up any big plays and then we just keep that going we'll be all right you said earlier in the week that the key to stopping their offense was to hold them the very short yardage on first down have you been successful well we've done pretty well at dad yes we brought up third down along quite a number of times and I think we've got to continue to do that to stop the drives three interceptions would seem to show that you're reading their short passing game very well well we've had some makes some great individual execution there Preston Kendricks that jumped up twice and caught that quick shot that time throws and I hope we can keep on what worries you anything well of course we have had any adversity to overcome yet and if we win the game we're gonna have to overcome some somewhere down the line and make a long drive in this game good luck thank you very much coach the Sugar Bowl is brought to you by ABC Sports we'll be back with more right after this America this Vega wagon is priced lower than any other competitive wagon made in America this Vega wagon cost less than any competitive America made wagon even if you add available equipment like white stripe tires wheel trim rings and a 140 cubic inch 2 barrel engine and no America made wagon got better gasoline mileage than the Vega wagon with the available 2 barrel engine according to dynamometer test results published by EPA well we think begum makes more sense than every Chevrolet take a close look around your office the rushing the lastminute changes the mistakes now look at the IBM mag cards Selectric typewriter it lets the secretary type right over mistakes if there's a change shiri types only the change and the mag card types out the finished letter automatically isn't this a better way with me is Nebraska coach Tom Osborne time you've obviously had problems with turnovers in the first half how much does the long layoff before a bowl game affect the team's time well I don't know obviously it's affected ours and we moved the ball times fairly well but we had bad field position we had a lot of turnovers and contributor to that and of course this is the thing we've got to eliminate also it looks like we may be winners ready to play as we thought we would we feel we're going to win the football game that's what our players thinking we'll just see who's right for us Florida seems to be reading Davis hums passes very well why do you think they're able to do that they've got a big defensive man that's playing real well right now Dave I think spent a little slow throw on the ball a couple of times a couple times you didn't throw it well but we can do better what we have done Thank You men should except for the turnovers you seemed able to move the ball well at times well we see many changes in your offense the second half not too much okay thanks a lot time good luck Keith thank you downtown Oakland this is Keith Jackson along with coach Barry Switzer of the University of Oklahoma and Jim pi3 is on the other sideline dragon his laryngitis around and we're a 10 nothing ballgame here with Florida leading at the end of 30 minutes to play indicators have just come back on the beer wearing the blue Nebraska Cornhuskers with the turnovers at halftime shutout only for the second time in the season Oklahoma State was the only other team ahead of scoreless at halftime and there are the statistics and the total yards now beginning to even up a little bit more that's because Florida was get anything real serious going in the second quarter has amazed that the Nebraska is out rushed Florida in the ballgame I didn't have that impression the statistic key that kills the Nebraska right now they've thrown 11 passes they've had only to complete for 16 yards right three interceptions let's go back quickly to done I spent half time in the Nebraska locker room with the team and the mood was one of quiet analysis there weren't a lot of emotional outpouring it's not a lot of fiery speeches coach Tom Osborne feels that his team can move the ball in Florida he feels that we'll be able to physically move them out and if they can just stop the turnovers he's sure they can put more than 10 points on the board in the second half he all right on the still shiny we thought for a while just about 5:00 5:30 to this afternoon we might get some rain but obviously the rain threat is gone now as the skies clear and the temperature remains around the 70 degree mark very comfortable evening in New Orleans Louisiana Mike oil is going to kick it off for the Nebraska Cornhuskers he's a junior out of Omaha going deep for Florida will be number 33 Tony Green and number 27 Henry Davis Green is on the left side there and Davis is on the right side Davis a sophomore out of Panama City and of course Tony Green who scored the Florida touchdown on the 21 yard run the first quarter is 180 pound freshman out of Sarasota along the front lorna will open up as they did to start the game with McGriff the wide receiver and unless Stefan rates Parker Stanfill kinds Wallace Williams Darby in that order from left to right Darby was most impressive as a tight end in the first half and particularly so on that one long pass he caught the backfield expected to be Gaffney Green Richards and DuBose all right here's cars kickoff it's freedom behind almost fell down totally black down the flag flown over here on the near sideline at about the 25 yard line the tackle by number 83 Steve Weiser and number 47 Jim toca ophtho Braska so let's see what the penalty situation is as the official comes along to pick up the slack a return by Green where he almost stumbled and fell inside his 10yard line he got back to about the 17 and we'll see what the call is and how deep it backs the Gators looks like it might back them halfway because I suspect him out of been a clip over here they play good defense right now Keith they've got the chance to get the best field position they've had since the first quarter the ball game they can keep me from making the first here what's the punt they've got a chance to get that four down zone 1 1st and 10 all right they back them up to they let's call it the ball is outside the 10 yard line but it's pretty close to that 10 yard stripe that's where we're going to start them at the 10 Gaffney is go back to voice the fullback lubos brings the ball up from the jam to about the 16 yard line a good game running behind the left side of the line williams and lawless and it was blocking below the waist only the third time this season I've seen that call we saw some blocking that play too I tell you Florida is really doing a fine job of blocking the front the offensive line that's a gain of six little more than six extra second in the short and the gain is up to about the 22 yard line and it should be a first down as Duboce the fullback hits in with authority and here's Jim limpet no halftime visitor to the Florida locker room would have had any difficulty telling that the Gators were a head coach Doug Dickey told them they weren't yet firmly in command of the ballgame but they could be they came out and moved the ball well enough to score on this Drive he wants them to score now moving from the 23 yard line where the first down was made after the 25 Duboce the fullback again 'harry oh he's got 52 yards now three on that one little more than three 31 yard line he'll be 2 yards short of his first down is Tom pag\u00e8s makes it at the tackle and that's a double handful for Tom in the ball game it looks like a play we run Keith and you've got most your folks back Dexter we've got a quarterback Steve Davis of course Jill wash that ain't greatest running back in America fact that are quite a few other people gettin affect me and servo folks on that play pitch dip deep the Richards and Richard turned it in for the first down crosses the 35 yard line they may not give his progress to that corner wherever he will I believe had the first down and there's a penalty flag on the field she had right there it's Florida and it's gonna go against the Gators no question about it they're backin up that's the first time we've seen that play Keith the true triple option with a flare block for the pitch bat that halfback on the option play and we got the ball pitched the first time with in that series involving it's been leading the lead blocker for the quarterback one illegal procedure Don it means somebody was moving too soon normally that's what it means so make it a third down and long third down and six 27 is alive though some 32 another penalty flag if you had 20 yards you're dead Oh we'll see what this one is that flag slam from the very beginning every and Florida has been getting all the calls so the Gators come out start making some mistakes themselves to start the third quarter away after being relatively a mistakefree in the first half previous indication of the earliest indication we had was a clip and it looks like that's what it's going to be so that'll back him up to the 717 yard line this having occurred out around the 32 watch number 56 the Florida and blue John reading my lips here the nose guard good call to pull back and he jumps back to the 30yard line well they've been around that 30yard line for quite a while now DuBose continues to find some room to run up the middle I tell you what they're doing out there they're doing it does a great job of blocking inside Florida's played extremely well in their long offensive line tonight Duboce is a good runner but he's getting a lot of help up inside but the succession of penalties bring it up to fourth down and two yards to go and the Gators will fund the custom artisan to do that Nikki okay then line up breathing he does he's just about seven yards back hey it looks like tight fun all night long I guess it you know what they're doing 36 yards on the kick and borough fair catching the ball for Nebraska back about the 35 yard line and the Cornhuskers will open this way offensive lead dope all worth bonus Koechner Crenshaw and machine ski with far the white man and the backfield will be humble instead of Anthony Davis and Westbrook Oh Larry and the junior from Port Washington New York makes it from the 35 to the 42 Alvin Cowan shoved him out of bounds for Florida gain of seven its sweep to the tight end the quote then the best play an entire ballgame Keith you know they run that play a lot the Barry Switzer but they don't seem to run it as wide as some teams do he was almost in line they kick out on the corner they're trying to go inside the year three yards to go 42 over the rest of Florida leading 10 to nothing glad to cut it back a little and he's gonna be short of his first doubt I believe about 31 a bleed two sweeps No number 78 Christmas for Florida and Ortega number 55 were the two men that jammed that play they'll bring the change all the way across Nebraska needs to do something here Keith they've got to get some momentum about six program is being brought to you as a special exclusive of ABC Sports let's for five seconds to allow our local stations to identify themselves 11:49 to go in the third quarter the third down conversions reflected there Nebraska and eating out of foot may be a bad move five to defense O'Leary got a stumbling start but carries through for the first down at the 47 yard line they're playing on artificial turf here at the circle Bowl and it's first down Nebraska at their own 47 3 runs in a row there they got a first down let's see if they come again I believe they're going to try to salt and move the ball on the ground Cornhuskers looking for their six makes it up for the 49 yard line before he is brought down wet Crippen number 52 and bird barber 52 where is hurting let me back to the huddle grip is 78 Florida has some signs of defensive front grip it's 241 greenhouse guard 228 Daryl carpet of 245 Barbara howevers 208 not that big story on all area so far in the ballgame second down nine and give him a yard on the free city carry here's the ball that pitch go where he has to go chase it all the way back to the 30 it's too hard a pitcher to handle their swats ID number 90 Preston shinbei I bet they wish it kept Bevin in the brook right there well here's the big number not he involved again he's had a great ballgame berry no question buddy's great player great athlete watch that number one fields come up in a hurry now you'll see him get involved here right there monster man third down there got about a half mile to go the ball is back just outside the 35 yard line he had moshevsky open and mr. power target Khepera de Gators have the ball first then the rest at 34 yard line for interception Larry just couldn't reach it again some some people have the notion that moving to a compact means giving up a lot not so General Motors 1975 Chevrolet Nova Pontiac Ventura Oldsmobile Omega and Buick Apollo offer you a comfortable ride Rufus six the added space of hatchback models plus good gas mileage and lower overall operating costs thanks to GM's maximum mileage system the most advanced engineering and technology we can offer on our 75 cars following recommended service schedules our 75 compacts could save you more than $300 maintenance over there 74 counterparts using leaded fuel projected over 50,000 miles what's more the prices of many fullsize used cars are the highest in years so you could be pleasantly surprised at the dollar difference between your fullsize car and a GM compact all in all there may never be a better time to move to a GM compact than right now have another look at that previous play as David hung had his intended receiver open and just let missed it they're playing too deep here they playing five short zone and the tight end is open but he late to follow up overthrows him here if you oh I saw blob past you see it go over the tide in find interception here for support little apology the press the 34yard line leading to nothing pitch back with Tony green he's down inside the 25 to have up to 24 and it could be a first down David Hoff in his career 1974 for example he said ball passes intercepted tonight during the whole season he only had eight intercepted deer in his career has only had a total of 36 intercepted this is the worst that David Thomas probably played in his career at Nebraska and he's had a tremendous career career he's a great football player he even won a lot of football game for him but that happens to you Terry luck number 11 warming up on the sidelines so then they rested a bit on the next series we'll see but just shame to see what I think is a brilliant football player has such a bad night on the sub Thursday I'd love to change across the field you did not hear the explosion of despair for naught because it's the first down as the rest of the folks navigated to hold their breath in Florida grinds it along from the 24 to do pose he's down to 20 maybe inside the 20 there's lava Terry luck as a youngster has had some injury troubles at Nebraska Terry Lux has some bad luck three knee operations are thrown at that great pursuit than Nebraska there they have to dig in right here because they're in trouble I'm Osborn walking the sidelines compeiied again involved in that stop along with George Kairos and safety water back Fiona's green 33 ft 8 Richards James Richard 31 and Vinnie DuBose number 35 I think that do pose has been been a surprise in this ball game Barry he's helped he's made big plays when they need them he nearly made a long third 18 a while ago in a few yards short picked up boys 69 yards so far here's the handoff to Tony green gets slides around the corner look out penalty we need to go spike up Thornton stands as a great run he's just a freshman they're so the Florida oh my goodness that was absolutely an incredible effort by Tony green 18 yard run behind the world he stayed on in bounds but he did they broke the formation on that place he they had to wide out to the left at the white side of the field and they had him lined up in the flanker and they ran a half factory first part is gone so we take away that touchdown and we had so delirious Nicole there come home and bring it back to the six seven yard line he lost yardage on that play he went out of the five I say whatever look at that run the moment soon as we have a ten now they're backing up to the seven second down and goal to go somebody caught him by the shirt tail and jerked him backwards dirt and gold at the one but they don't throw keep I certainly wouldn't think so the way they're blowing holes up front as the power sweeping the tight inside they gave it to the right guy now we'll get a time here so we've got a time out seven minutes and 58 seconds to go in the third quarter of play and Florida leading 10 nothing looking for some more hay chances are you never think about your underwear think about it 100% cotton underwear it keeps you cool and comfortable because 100% cotton is natural it breathes cotton the underwear fiber it keeps you fresh and comfortable all day long hey look at my big guy when you're looking for comfort look for the sign of cotton the more cotton the better you feel to show how the new Goodyear Poly steel radial tire helps reduce hydroplaning wheel tested

promote of these ABC and those are the football is just about touching the Nebraska oneyard line and the Huskers are just gonna stuff everybody right in the middle and try to hold on here and you kind of figure that's where Florida's gonna go on third down and goal to go quarterback a sterol sj\u00f6str\u00f6m for quiet I believe here he couldn't hear the keys let's watch that run now by a green see if we can pick up where he stepped up pull both guards they had three backs line at the left side they run a halfback reverse he steps out right here keep that leash if it's a good call but official you see his right foot go out in the fiveyard line about the four and a half yard line right here but he makes a great run tight whoops down the sidelines gets it in the end zone I thought he was four all right here we go third down go to go from just outside the one DuBose I don't believe great defensive flavor the whole front of the Nebraska line is linebackers made a fine play Nelson and Mons in particular wonder Mons he muttered and stuck him right in a gizzard would not give it and there you see when I tell you what you don't I'd run a play they can't run I've turned hen at the chill Washington here they don't have so why should I bet they turn the head at the Greenway to say you've got to go for it but do you go straight to the Atlantic it's Richard Jimbo noona that is man that's a great point fresco we talked about poor field position to fill taken by 50 yesterday hits the football so from what appeared to be an apparent touchdown which would have given Florida a big big lead in the third quarter Tony green detected stepping on the sidelines and now the Cornhuskers have it Florida's had the ball at the Nebraska 34 the 37 the 34 and they failed to produce points out of those points of possession that's an important thing to remember hold on with football pony Davis pushing him down heywhere sold him dead and he's bothering up a storm about a tureen luck is in the ballgame at quarterback from nebraska and it looked like davis might pop out of their indoor hunt he we had a foot race right then Davis will fool you he's quicker than you think here's at fourth down play watching Florida was only a foot away from scoring they decided to go wide the Richards to the split inside pitch the ball came every yard short Jimmy burrow number two they just stopped all right the football now is out at the 7 yard line Nebraska's ball Terry luck number 11 the quarterback he gives it the money Anthony the freshman tailback for the eye back then he does as he surges up maybe to the 9 yard line last play with pullback leading on the linebacker they picked up short yardage here well that's a heck of a turnaround you know Barry from the standpoint of having that might turn out to be the play that marks one of these well the home court is doing when it's got the honk but the risk of we're going to find out in the next few plays whether it will make signaling just something with it with certain will alright it's third down yard and a half for the first down at the 9 he's got the first down yardline well Cowan's the tuckle nor they ran the pitch sweep into the tight in that time team in the in Florida was anticipating if the linebackers cheated over Ortega at the last second cheated over and tried to run through you'll see him move the outside right here hey Cameron excuse me Cameron full plate the same high school close able Florida alright first down Nebraska just outside the 21 and luck gives to Tony Davis and it bang it in the middle for about three our here's John Donaldson this year the guest of honor the Sugar Bowl basketball tournament was a man who during his 42 years at the University of Kentucky won more games than anyone else in the history of college basketball Adolph Rupp over all those years did you have a chance to watch funny football game oh yes I have a football game at the University plain I made any of the trip for the team way from home I got to see a lot of yes postseason playoffs have generated so much enthusiasm Susie has amande college basketball would you like to see the same kind of system in college football this I sure a ball tournament has done a wonderful thing for college basketball and I'd like to see the same thing and football by the way we have in basketball we had four great games down here this year bad I'd like to see the same three teams come down here that's used to come down here it off you brought a lot of excitement to a lot of sports fans and I want to congratulate thank you I've had a lot of fun doing that and I enjoyed every bit of that way thank you all right money yesterday for a loss 33 yard line they'll put it down for 11 yards and it's under bresca first down so suddenly Tony Davis with Barry Hawk in there at quarterback becomes the man of the moment for Nebraska they've come a long way already Chris lease is ABC three minutes in 50 seconds to play in the third quarter Marda what brilliant goalline stand by Nebraska down a Brad he goes short passes in front of the intended receiver incomplete it was rich fall you know David might lost confidences passing in teeth you know it was a poorly thrown volley under three about ten yards he's not that kind of quarterback he's a fine quarterback but they just got the colemak hung on the night before he left in favor of luck 2 out of 12 for 16 yard interception tailback Davis to fall back almost fumbled away Gracie's consistent he's running twice building twice in his public all times we've got that was back teeth here's another look at it here he goes on a reverse fine job great flock of a tight end coming crossing the linebacker and forcing the favorite catch quality homer midair they deepest Drive Nebraska's hands to the Florida 45 before they gave up the ball gave it up particular occasion here's luck coming down the line on the option turns it in he's inside the 45 to about the 44 Vernon barber the stop for the Gators at 255 to play in the third quarter good yardage from first and ten they got control of it right now on earth well I'll tell you if Nebraska takes it 99 and a half yards for a touchdown whatever sparking she's got to with the 42 you know I wonder if they're automatic in math you know that secondary of Florida is ruling up at the last minute to the wide side of the field Keith they're cheating over and the corners loosening some safety moving over and I wonder if maybe they're not automatic into that play I tell you it's a Johnny hot spot for Terry luck to be trusted who though but he's handled his assignment very well as they all plays except one have been on the ground third down and about three from the 42 got it I believe Cody's got the first down I believe that was a trap keeper they stopped the clock asked for the job they are either they take a good look and wave first now I'm 41 to go in the third quarter let's talk about the psychology of the moment here with Barry Switzer man of the Oklahoma Sooners we got a brand new quarterback in there and Terry luck you suddenly stop the other team when it seems sure they scored and now you're on the move yourself what can this do to a football game okay football is momentum for sure no question right now if they take this in the brass school a habit and have a lot of it got a chance to defeat anyone in the country and if they haven't put the seven on the board it had a long impressive drive right now that control the football Florida still playing good defense but you know they still got 35 yards to go anything can happen but if they get it in we're gonna see a heck of football game the football is resting at the 36 yard line of Florida it is second down and seven that's Davis he's got to push down as he blows it down to the 24 yard line Alvin powers back them down well the arcade and the Oscars ain't moving it on the ground I think that Tony to Oklahoma Nebraska Florida this whole just absolutely tearing his way through behind the blocker POTUS and all word Boulevard come 87 yards keep 12 yard pickup for Tony Davis the Cornhuskers have a first down just inside the Florida 13 yard line take a guy there was her weapon brother Tony Davis in salmon is the fullback replacing three two one time expires in the third quarter so we've got 15 minutes of football play here at the Super Bowl and Florida still leads it 10 to nothing I used to shave like a barbarian hacking and cutting my face then chick introduced the civil I shake super to the twin blade cartridge with teflon coating now I can shave clothes but say even with the track 200 F line coats the edge of each super to play for a close shave civilize a try a chic super to cartridge because what are we barbarians America what do you love that's baseball hotdogs apple pie and Chevrolet huh makes sense to me celebrate the New Year with Chicago tonight on wide world special well here we go to the final 15 minutes of the Super Bowl game the 41st Football Classic in New Orleans Nebraska with a football first down just inside the Florida 13 yard line what a dramatic swing we've had in the closing moments of the third quarter and now with 15 minutes to go let's see what happened Jerry Luck is now in at quarterback here's the pitch to my and today eSport at about the 11 yard line and chef packed 78th Griffith is there backside pursuit got him right there I thought they're gonna make more on the plate looks like a lot of good blockers in front of him then Keith in the back side of chute number 70 a great flavor David Homme standing on the sidelines had a frustrating night by far the worst of his career and Terry luck now has moved the Nebraska football team from one half yard away from his own goal line down to the 11 yard line inside the hole back and Gary Higgs pounds along Davis back in Tony Davis having had some equipment repair is back in there and this Drive really as belong to David Terry Luke is having some good luck right now top three me operations being a second team quarterback be coming in in a situation that I know is the second team or I wouldn't want to go hot here I have to try to take a team behind 10 points and 99 yards defend this job let's see if he can do it so far they have 16 ways used 8 minute on the clock love coming down the line burns inside dives he's close to his first down he took it too just outside the six go back tight in the fog I have two tight ends up believe they took the week taking the wing back out the bar probably go with you I formation to Titian's here on short first we can first and go over all is just outside the frame of the two brother seven first downs of the five sixteen five eight minutes plus in controlling the ball first and goal looked like they had a touchdown as Breen came up with a spectacular rod everybody here thought it was a touchdown nebraska held them at move 99 and a half yards for the touchdown and here's another Lincoln in that he goes over the top for the six and the Huskers are mainly on the board we talked about momentum now Keith you will see how the Braska plays defense we got bored now as Florida leaves the rest of my three McDonald's Big Mac it's more than just another hamburger there are two allbeef patties special sauce lettuce cheese pickles and onions on a sesameseed bun' seven great ingredients working together to make one great taste two allbeef patties special sauce cheese lettuce pickles onions on a sesameseed bun' get the idea to your McDonald's Big Mac you've got to

we see to two allbeef patties special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onions on a sesameseed bun Chee's I love cheese oh wow I think you deserve a break today and where your dollar gets a break every day on that touchdown drive of 99 plus yard 18 plays 8 minutes and 46 seconds 7 first downs Anthony's scoring it but Tony Davis picked up 52 of those 99 yards if he was off the field of play or two plays in the drive here is a football team for Lincoln Nebraska that's been through the brambles in many many cases looking for their sixth consecutive bowl victory right here Keith will determine the momentum factor in the ballgame Nebraska can play great defense right here stop them which they haven't been able to do without a first you can push the punt Nebraska is coming back at you know Tom Osmond said they believe they can win they're winners they've got a great tradition universe in Nebraska have kept the boys they demonstrated that in the last series Jeff near the quarterback gives to DuBose over the right side attention from the 12 to the 16 yards picked up four yards maybe a little more John Lee and Ron through it made the tackle for Nebraska their third quarter statistics now begin to swing in favor more certainly and rushing it does but very close now in total yardage only eleven yards separating them handoff to the fullback he's hammered as he comes up to the 19 yard line maybe the 18yard line has got to go to just beyond the 21 for the first down in the middle of the practice john lee 69 prime play believe hearing slanted to the right and they happen to run the fullback plays tried to cut back on him but he made the place a third and three here this the biggest play of the ball game right now for Nebraska Daphne mr. green puts the football Marc idler and Tom feet Florida's got a tough it up now and give Nebraska field position we missed a push time in a long time we'll keep the questions pretty able to stop it without a person's uniforms it fun it's a big play form let's see if we can move the ball on offense the rest Buster Morrison needs a big kick here a little bit of wind in his back Oh hangs burro picks it at the 43 that's out of bounds that's the Florida 49 yard line they back them up around the 50 38 yards on 8 yard return and Florida and Nebraska 7 we'll be right back yes I'd like a butane lighter please which one oh they're all about too thin I wish you hadn't said that cricket lighter is really quite alive it'll last for months and still burn bride with thousands of surefire lights and a flame that adjust to different heights that's Nord nari crooked well crickets no ordinary lighter got your credit for a dollar 49 by Gillette Oh long time no see welcome home you see reflected there on your television screen in the 10year history of Nebraska with 91 wins that's more than any other team in the country is one so these guys know what it's all about a whole organization at Nebraska knows how the win and success breeds success in so many cases see what Florida can do now the Gators are up against it they lead by three but here say with their primary tool in that long touchdown March Tony Davis is Terry luck remains at the quarterback position they were the truth'll spread formation at time t that you think maybe they went to a feeling to soften up in the middle of the random face play the field back made very little yardage Davis came to O'Leary comes in at the I back position but O'Leary now moves up O'Leary on that counter inside and he slices it over the right side behind Crenshaw and Hector and he reaches the 43 yard line before they get it Nebraska is going to be looking at third down and about four do you think they'll go fourth fourth down I'm short here Keith 34 I wouldn't think so long or how short it is they'll be inside the 40 eleven minutes of leaving chicken lalito wide to the left got it about the 41 got a decision to make there's gonna be a five yard and a half from the first down just shy of the 40 sandy Green made that tackle for Florida ten minutes Amy green 10 minutes and 30 seconds to play in the blue ball game I think got the better part of two yards very more than two of it you know right up inside there and where the where the ball games are won and the offensive defensive line they've got a heck of a battle one on the pharmacist Sammy green the finals work for them they're going to go for it on fourth and short crowd comes up Nebraska on the sideline I tell you Wayne fields the monster man from Florida came slide in trying to plug that hole and he got there just a fraction Lee they had to do a good job of blocking in because Florida was stacked up inside a at 90 well right up in the line of scrimmage and they just putted them out of there for three yards and got the first that's the florida 38yard line first and foremost Davis down to the 32 yard line so he goes from the 38 to the 32 for a pick 6 yard gain on the first down flat for those of you who have not heard it on a New Year's Eve catfish hunter is a wealthy man signed five years with the New York Yankees for a reported 3.7 million dollar total Jim now gone do some serious harm second down four yards to go at the 32 yard line of Florida Davis again Tony Davis is playing football like a wild man here in the second half a game 10yard where you think that guy's not a competitor he's excited despite football I wish we had him line him up the wishbone in the ball about 30 times a game we can play all right there all right for this formation we move inside nine minutes to go in a football game Davis 10 scariest 70 yards in this half alone its first down for the Cornhuskers at the Florida 22 yard line he gets a couple of yards before four or five blue shirts can drop him right excuse me Keith they tried to fake the pitch sweep to the tidy on that side and hand the ball off him quick play the fool back off the pitch sweet series remind you for Eastern Time this coming Saturday for most of these ABC stations the hula bowl from Honolulu Hawaii great football players in that second down and eight luck delivers the ball there's a great play for that defensive corner of the leaf block before the blast can mist him and he can feed him to the outside made a fine play they're lucky with any fumble football right no gain on the play is third down and eight ball just short of the 20 and the clock continues to tick along 7:35 to go in the game Florida 10th Nebraska 7th when a dramatic turnaround we had you think this to be luck second pass the rush pressured Amos he was able to throw it over that linebacker Westbrook within there and I think we might have a touchdown oh my goodness we're down an eighth they've got a kick and see if we get a ball we've reflected back to what Tom Osborne said when he came out of the locker room but we've also should remember what God Dickie said at the close of the first half when he said his team would have to overcome adversity all right here is my coil number 42 in going to tie it up from 37 yards that's where those low shots Mike it usually reforestation was pretty much up to the whims of nature if the seeds weren't tossed upon the rocks are eaten by a hungry native a new forest began dr. Jeff Daniels warehouser research scientist believes that's not good enough anymore his forestry team now singles out the ideal parent plus trees he calls them branch tips are clipped these scions are then grafted onto growing plants in seed orchards combs from these trees produce superior seeds and in turn superior seedlings they are returned to the same growing environment as the parent thriving little trees that already have a good start in life it costs warehouser millions of dollars each year to regenerate the forest like this but dr. Daniels figures it's worth every penny warehouser the tree growing company the Sugar Bowl is one of the classic bowl games in Nebraska's honor to be playing in it but this stadium could well be empty next year or the year after if we don't help the president and ourselves and saving our energy resources all sports have joined President Ford's win campaign and one way we can help is through saving fuel make use of car pools buses and public transportation when going to a game or to work you'll find a saves fuel and saves money and these days we need to well a big red folks are happy oh I'll tell you they're at dancing in the aisles and here the Cornhuskers kicking it all the score is tied at 1010 and it is Jim Richard returning it before God he gets up 25 yard return before Tom fate brings him down and when all is set me down in this football game is over tonight remember that same fate because old Tom has played him suck a heck of a ballgame the pressure gives Ford another test here keep the last time Florida had the ball the first time I had math mating first down since midway in the second quarter we'll give a test right here to fall back and Lee number 69 the middle guard is right there to pluck the hole he got some help looking for the number of the other man I believe leaves slanted the weak side in the tight end ran around and made the play from behind supplying played by Mark Martin empty mouth Louis and of a body yard on the play and it's second down and 9 6 minutes and 35 seconds to play in the football game crow flipped it to the sidelines sleeps along the sidelines and got quite a bit out of it definitely he may have made a first down who cares got a little more quickness people trying to hit him up over there he didn't get a first down as he took the football out beyond the 47 yard line so they moved the change he stopped the clock at 613 I'd remind you when you're partying is done what a sit back and relax over the weekend I can tell you if I were to do it right in front of your television set over most of these ABC stations we start with to the hula bowl on ABC's Wide World of Sports at 4:00 Eastern the superstars begins Sunday here comes

breast at the Florida 31 cuts it back to the 29 yard line for the 2 yard pickup the American sportsman this Sunday 3:30 Eastern 2:30 central at Pacific time over most of these ABC station Robert Redford narrates story about the tundra wolf ABC's Wide World Sports this Sunday the premiere program offers world heavyweight championship fight the Brassica Florida is to the 25yard line picked up for four and a half yards before Hutchison and Cameron make the tackle Davis had gone out he's on the sidelines right now Tom Osborne the Nebraska coach with two minutes and 15 seconds to play in the game calling time there has never been a time in the Sugar Bowl we are even right now at 1010 between Nebraska and Florida with 215 to go and the Huskers remove it it was making its way through the Florida Keys fighting down hard and a pretty stiff breeze Bigfoot introducing the Goodyear poly steel radial two steel belts and eight wide grooves to help prevent water from building up under the tire where the shrimp boats past the game came down and seven wide ribs grabbed the ground kept on its feet where it's hard to hold that Goodyear poly steel radio is worth its weight in gold Bigfoot Bigfoot keeps its feet even in the rain now this is competition how fair up puts this jacket together with this kind of quality escapes me I sew my fingers to the bone for something like this padded shoulders single stitched flat seems fantastic pattern match up boy Farah has some way of topping their slacks no wonder I stay on pins and needles Farris slacks and jackets everything about him looks tailormade how are you gonna beat that the football is sitting at the Florida 25yard line just inside it third down and four in a 1010 tie with 2 minutes and 15 seconds to play in the game very lucky and he's short of the first time he gets to a popular 22 he'll be a yard maybe a little more from his first down at this point coach Barry Switzer of Oklahoma I would suggest Nebraska has established physical superiority they get the big play coming up here you remember Florida some situation about like this a while ago on the oneyard line fourth down and one brass get calls timeout here they face the same situation one minute and 53 seconds to play in the ball game here the horny first Sugar Bowl football classic Nebraska has one timeout remaining very luck gone to the sidelines to talk to Tom Osborne the Professional Bowlers tour begins at 40 here of live coverage on ABC television to sanity from Alameda California the $60,000 KRC Alameda open and Dick Weber joins fresh a cold for the Professional Bowlers tour this year on ABC new 30 Eastern 1:30 central and for Pacific time although most of these ABC station later go kick Akif well it's fourth down they have the better part of a yard and a half for the first down so they're not going to risk not making the first down instead we'll go for a 39 yard field goal and Mike Foyle made a 37yard field goal to tie the game he kicks out of Luck's hole 39 emotional satellite four seconds to play and the beach isn't distal to the man who uses Vitalis liquid hasn't me well groomed hair he wants it that way because he knows it's a look that says a lot Vitalis liquid in feedly the simple pleasures mean more to a man like bourbon flavored Borkum red a softer milder smoke that could only have come from Sweden or come with one of life's simple pleasures well I'll tell you it's been a spectacular football game Florida missing an opportunity to take a 17 nothing lead at Nebraska compounding back nine a nine and a half yards and now the Gators trailed by three grand it's Tim Daly Lito spillin number 61 destroyed the tips in Reverse by Florida and the Gators now with a minute 42 seconds shuffle up their 10yard line here's the field goal kick my coil and look he didn't really make it with a whole lot of reason room did it and counsel long as it's inside accounts for the ball and apparently got his arm forward trying to get it over to it eligible receiver Jim Richards number 31 and it goes as an incomplete pass it was wrong through it of Nebraska who put the pressure on and get me now is four out of eight in passing for 79 yards I think they called him down and Keith they moved the ball back seconds about hitting that half he was probably on the ground before he tried to pass looks like so he backed it up with the 10 and very close to the nine runs away from the taste now he breaks it out but gagging scramble gets it up to the 14 to play in the game Florida has two timeouts remaining I'm gonna try to get another playoff here they've got Tony wide to the left out of your picture I thought they'd move green up in the secondary it was wide open drop the ball Tony had it right in his hands with 43 seconds to play and dropped it and Tony Davis of Nebraska has been announced as the most valuable player of the game there's no surprises the case survey he's turned his second half around that's the best guy I know of his last 30 minutes Peter Davis 17 carries a hundred and twenty four yards well it is fourth down for Florida they need the six yards for the first down with 43 seconds to play Gaffney will try to flow again he goes to the short man the pass is caught up at the 31 yard line by McGriff that'll stop the clock as they move the chains up 35 seconds to play in the football game Gators trying to get up to the line of scrimmage and get set for a place without having to spend a timeout 35 seconds alright that'll start the clock now 30 seconds can't get it off almost lost the football the 21 seconds to play in the game part across time and Jeffy needs a new shirt so unless lightning really strikes here for the Florida Gators on second down and 15 Tom Osborne will go to a happy locker room with his Nebraska Cornhuskers having won the ballgame 1310 but they worked for it Antonio Davis might be the most valuable player in the ball game Keith but I think my call said something through with it to to pressure field goals and I give somebody on that Nebraska coaching staff perhaps he was Tom Osborne perhaps it was some member of the staff who might have said let's keep it on the ground let's take it to him let's go at him the oldfashioned way and that's exactly how they want that's exactly right they wanted on the ground the second half rushing to football they came out of the ball game trying to throw the football in the second half they had statistics like we usually have in a passing game they didn't complete a pass they crew only three and have one intercepted sounds like they're running a wishbone twentyone seconds to play in this forty first Super Bowl football classic it's gonna go from 13 to 10 the rest oh they go into a deep prevent defense threeman rush ducking the threeman rush led by John Lee 69 Mike folks 72 Down Goes Getti o'clock running ten seconds remaining and Florida spins its last timeout well I tell you you talk talk talk about the offensive people consistently and the big guys up front very seldom get the kind of credit deserved but the people up in front on that Nebraska offensive line the defense has been pretty obvious here in the second half but up front it's been dope hallward bonus Hector Crenshaw Bush schinsky and Brad chickens in and tight end Tony Davis carrying the ball in the second half remarkable 12 carries 112 yards 17 for the ball game at 124 yard Davis can't do it by himself no question about it though he did rip and snort and tear when he got loose into that secondary the Pro Bowlers tour starts off the weekend on

  "transcript": "for the past 23 years either Ohio State or Michigan has led the nation in football attendance Michigan averaging just under 94 thousand for this season has assumed the lead but today here at Ohio Stadium in Columbus every nook and cranny is filled with a partisan of one kind or another and now ladies and gentlemen introducing the offensive team for the Michigan Wolverines number 37 from Blue Island Illinois split in Jim Smith number 67 from Tiffin Ohio quick tackle Steve King number 74 from Garden City Michigan right guard Kirk Lewis number 50 from Bethel Park Pennsylvania senator Dennis Franks number 58 from Detroit left guard Jim Armour number 64 from Midlothian Illinois strong tackle Pat Tom Paine number 84 from Kentwood Michigan tied Ian Gregg denmoor number 24 from Elizabeth New Jersey wingback Gil Chapman number 44 from Tippin Ohio fullback Chuck heater number 5 from Troy Ohio tailback Gordon Bell number nine from Nestle and Ohio quarterback cocaptain Dennis Franklin number six from akron ohio defensive safety cocaptain dave brown and the head coach of the Michigan Wolverines Bo Schembechler introducing the offensive team for the Ohio State Buckeye number 80 from Dayton Ohio tied in Doug France number 72 from Lorain Ohio left tackle kurt Schumacher number 60 from gibsonburg Ohio left guard Ted Smith number 52 from Kent Ohio Center Steve Myers number 69 from bookless Ohio right guard dick Mac number 73 from Williamsport Pennsylvania right tackle Scott Donnelly number 82 from Xenia Ohio split hand Dave hazel number 7 from Washington DC quarterback Cornelius Green number 48 from pittsburgh pennsylvania wingback bryanbastian ago number 38 from Asheville Ohio fall back Herald Henson number 33 from Long Beach New York pull back Pete Jensen and the head coach of the Ohio State Buckeyes woody hey the ohio state buckeyes the home team will be wearing the home colors or the crimson church today they'll appear red the most of you while the Michigan Wolverines will be in the white shirts and there will be a vote on the Rose Bowl team following this fall game regardless of the outcome succinctly this is the way it will go if Michigan wins the ball game or if Michigan ties Ohio State then the Wolverines will have finished the season with the better conference record the better overall record and the boat should be academic if Ohio State wins the football game then the athletic directors will fly into Chicago tomorrow and they will sit down and eyeball each other and cast their ballots there will be no telephone vote if Ohio State wins it they will all go to Chicago meet and then vote tomorrow but if Michigan wins it or ties it then the vote will be done by telephone to the Commissioner Wayne Duke Commissioner of the big ten right here at Ohio Stadium so that in a nutshell is how it'll be handled the referee for the ball game today is Robert Palin and the Ohio State Buckeyes offensively along the front will look like this as the Buckeyes have won the toss and will receive it'll be 80 France 72 Schumacher who's back in good form and one of the great offensive tackles in the country 60 is Smith Myers 52 in the middle Myers having come off a broken hand Richard Mack 69 will be on the right side of the center 73 is Donnelly and 82 is Dave Hayes Oh so the Ohio State Buckeyes will receive the kickoff from the Michigan Wolverines in the backfield Cornelius green number 7 Archie Griffin 45 champ Hinson 38 and Brian Bosch Nageotte will be 48 the return men for Ohio State 89 is Leonard Willis he's a junior out of Washington DC's the man they'd like to get the ball aren't you Griffin will also be back there along with Brian bash and ago so there is speed to burn on the kickoff team for Ohio State kicking off for Michigan will be Michael entry number 36 who had a very good week last week in the field goal Department the weather the temperature nearing 60 degrees it is a clear sky and incredible day in this time of the year and the ball game is harm the 71st meeting between Ohio State and Michigan it is wills at the three yard line down field coverage is very good by Michigan and they get him at about the 13 yard line so the white plant Wolverines come down field in a hurry and Joe Paterno this has been one of the trademarks of this Michigan team kick coverage yeah that was a great kick coverage situation now I States the long way to go and we'll find out now whether they can dominate the line of scrimmage in today they have done and just about every game that they with the football a very interesting thing to put in the back of your head in the 10 games that they have played so far Ohio State has scored nine times on their first offensive position cornelius green is the quarterback as they work off the iformation with passion a go all the way back in green rolls he wants to throw he puts it up it is almost intercepted the pass was very badly thrown in Tom Drake number 28 had his hands on the ball at the 22 yard line okay you'll see now that he has a man open he overthrows it all but he's in a nice position in that zone he got right in the right scene and green just overthrew him a little but I guess maybe a little bit jittery early in the football game but looks like Ohio State's going to start right out throw on that football and keep it loose but what an emotional lift it might have been for the Wolverines had Tom Drake been able to hold on to it down around the 20yard line hit second down and 10 now let's call it the 12 yard line this offensive series closer there Greene's gonna throw it again deep in his territory getting pressure Jilla ketse number 81 the ball squirts loose but I believe he was down and he lost a yard on the play man Chilika junior out of Sterling Heights Michigan drilled in so Ohio State surprising everybody going to the air and the first offensive series deep in their own territory as you see the Big Ten standings Ohio State's only loss coming at East Lansing Michigan in one of the most controversial and exciting football games of any season we have a change of tide in now for Ohio State as Mike Bartow succumbs in number 87 replacing France he is the better fast receiver it is third down and 11 yards to go they pull the ball and there is no room for Archie Griffin he's ducked behind the line of scrimmage back at the 8 yard line and so the Michigan defense looks very quick and very strong in the first offensive series of the game they were in great position in all three of those plays actually and they're ready they're heads up right now Michigan figures to get the football in good field position as Ohio State is going to have to go to the punt and kick it out of the end zone and it'll be Tom's flat a knee during the fighting number one he is averaging but they need 45 and a half yards per punt he gets it up in the air he does not get a 45 yard average out of that one but he does to the roll it takes at Ohio State bounce and it roasted at the Michigan 47 yard line 44 yards on the punt and Michigan gets the ball almost in the middle of the field and along the front for Michigan they line up this way 37 is Smith that split in King is 6 to 7 Lewis 74 Dennis Franks number 50 in the middle at center armor 58 from Maine 60 for the tide in is denmoor 84 and the Michigan back vo Dennis Franklin at quarterback he says he feels pretty good ankle has to be sore they all the tailback he to the fullback testimony Gordon Bell he's an Ohio State Territory from his own 47 yard line he takes it to the fore he close to the 48 yard line kid blocking up front in a nice block by the lead pulled back on it looks like Michigan's going to do what we thought I'd say my dear they're gonna try to test that inside of a highstakes line go right out and they're in great field position they could put together a couple of first downs will be enough for down area call it a four yard pickup for Gordon Bell the tailback the ball is on the Ohio State 49 yard line Denis Franklin gives it the first man shucks heater heater goes to the Ohio State 45 yard line he gets four yards beat Kuzak number 71 the weightlifting 250 pound offensive tackle from Lakewood Ohio makes the stop on him and you're looking now at a third down and 2 for whiteshirted Michigan the Wolverines have won all 10 ball games they've had to struggle in a couple of them the Illini as you can see gave him a hard time but last week we saw them against Purdue and they were magnificent the ball is just inside the 45 third down and 2 yards to go for the first down for Michigan he's got the first down as he penetrates to about the 42 yard line the block thrown by Chuck heater the fullback he led him through the hole but some good work on the right side by number 58 Jim Armour the right guard that's a big personality if they get kicked in you get another one right now and there they sit in a four down area they get a chance to go down to make a first down and they're in good position to get on the scoreboard first which I think psychologically is a big thing in a football game of this statute this is the first of two games to be seen on most of these ABC stations today at 4:00 Eastern play the other half of the Rose Bowl battle between USC and you see Franklin searched the throne he goes to Chapman he's got him open Jeff finish loose running fur flag touchdown he thought was a great play fake by Franklin and mundo Chapman came across from the slop position and just found an opening spot in there Franklin just put it right on the button I was a great great football player Gero Chapman who figured to be a dramatic figure in this football game getting into the middle and he is a fine athlete Joe Paterno you know because you very hard to recruit him all right Michael entry is in for the extra point try out a pint out of the Tom Drake hole might consider left puts it through there and so 1152 to play in the first quarter Michigan takes the lead by a score of 7 to nothing and let's have another look at the touchdown if you see his Chapman now they're faking away from Chapman now he just works in that an open area gets the ball makes her man mission makes a beautiful cut on that nice downfield block by the tight end excellent that's a great way from is he gonna start Michigan quiet now settles over Ohio Stadium as Michigan has taken the ball and gone 53 yards in four plays in a minute and 48 seconds to take a seven nothing lead over the Ohio State Buckeyes the Buckeyes were favored to win this football game on their home field they may yet do it but they will work harder I suspect than they anticipated they might have to it'll take the resource of every man to bring it back because Bo Schembechler in his Michigan Wolverines they were steaming last weekend about this ball game and no question about it the fever for this game is as high as any as I have ever ever seen so my clan troupe will kick it off again for Michigan the deep manner Leonard wills 89 45 Griffin and 48 bash Nicole and the kick is drilled into the end zone it'll go out of the end zone and Ohio State will put it in play first down at their own 20 yard line if you want to see the touchdown and just joined us here it is again as Gil Tuchman takes the pass from Dennis Franklin gets a great block from the tide Ian and takes it in from 42 yards was it it was a great play that the 12 great coil priests antenna to that first down in Ohio State all took tough trying to stop their runs and stop another push down it would pitch a great play a great fall by the United States now let's meet one point about the Buckeyes can do from the 20s Cornelius green gives it to Archie Griffin he's hit at the line of scrimmage he's hit hard by number 59 Steve sprinkle the linebacker for Michigan he may have gained a yard certain enough he did not gain that much they give him just about a foot I would imagine Joe Paterno that every time Archie Griffin moves today there will be some member of that Michigan defensive unit moving with him well so many of the place at Ohio State users are very similar with the Michigan people really and I think that they you know they're familiar with them and they're are being good position for most of the ones when they had to tell it some others here's bringing back to pro he gets it off he throws it too high we have a penalty flag thrown we may get an interference call as fashion Agel had gone into the secondary as one of the two receivers Dave hazel was the other they're worse than bumping on fashion Agel and we may get a defensive interference call against Michigan there it is if Bob Fallon marks the ball so that will be a first down for the Ohio State Buckeyes their first of the ball game and that incidentally is the only penalty call in college football where you can get an automatic first down now bash Nagle is open here early Keith and now it's really a not a deliberate pass interference as you can see he just was trying to get in position intercept the ball in Buncombe away a 36yard green comes down the line pits us to utter Griffin number 45 and Griffin fighting up the sideline to them to Michigan territory a great individual effort by Archie Griffin it's a first down for Ohio State at the Michigan 46 yard line he gained 18 yards including the Rose Bowl of last year Archie Griffin has gained a hundred yards or more in 21 consecutive football games that's great for the running he's an awfully powerful young man around the thighs and in the hip he shakes off people very well his younger brother a freshman Ray Griffin backs him up at the tailback slot for Ohio State and he sets a little bit deeper off the eye than some of the teams that gives him a chance to read green times he keeps it this time Green coming around the corner he's down at the 42 yard line before he is rolled up by number 81 gillich off Michigan yeah yeah yeah you watch this you'll see the fullback make a great block on string Kol here and there's some good ball handling here and I think he gets lost with the fake and then the pull by just that's Johnson just runs over strength oh and puts in a green could take the ball away out he came four yards at his second down and six for Ohio State from the Michigan 42 Michigan leading at seven a nothing goes to Pete Judson number 33 and at fullback 246 pounds sophomore out of Long Beach New York and he takes the football down to the Michigan 38 yard line and he gained four yards it'll be second third down and about two yards coming up as we see what he Hayes here again we have a big a big play for a high estate if they can make this purse down and get that ball in the four down area they got some things going from because they they can score in this driveway the takeaways on that psychological edge that Michigan from the 30 backbeat Junction he and he's inside the 35 to the 33 he's got an Ohio State first down he ran him right behind machan Smith good block by the lead halfback on that to a good job Ohio State's record nine and one a corporate most everybody except Michigan State 33 goes to Archie Griffin he skips away from one but good pursuit by the Michigan Wolverines kept him after a yard maybe 2 yard pickup number 32 is in on the flavor too quickly Larry banks and Tim Davis the middle guard Tim Davis only weighs 210 pounds he's a junior out of Warren Ohio perhaps not the bigger man as you might expect to find like the little guard position in Big Ten football but very quick in Michigan does a lot of study with him a lot of looping he very rarely placed smack into that Center he's going to go to his right or left most of the time but getting the gap to offset his lack of weight second down in nine yards to go from the 32 yard line green keeps the ball up real fight the Griffin Michigan recovers Steve Stricker number 59 comes up with a football and there was a whale of a hit put on by number 97 for the Michigan Wolverine Jeff bourlingueur defensive tackle he knocked the ball loose and so the Michigan Wolverines make a break for themselves and get the football first down at their own 26yard line and they stop Ohio State for the second time highest state there to go in the first quarter nice taste really gotta play some defense now and get that ball back there get his Flint in the quarterback he keeps the ball he to turn the corner on the tight side and he gets a couple of yards out of the effort and we were talking before the game but coach Joe Paterno and we expected that Woody Hayes would stack the defense and protect the wide side of the field and that's what he's done the option play is not nearly as effective into the sidelines because you don't have as much room to run wide as it is to the open field and what do you play as extra man is Rover back to the open field mostly time enforced Michigan I think that to run wide into the sideline and probably run off tackle to open field in Smith against the PAL big hole up the middle for Thornton Bell and he goes to the 40 yard line and that'll be enough for a Michigan first down that was the ark tackle play that the open field where they're just a little bit looser than they are into that side then ball is just outside the 40 for the Michigan Wolverines s Bell picked up nine yards Gorton Bell a very dramatic running back first quarter history scoring this season you can see Ohio State has put a lot of points on the board early so far they are you notice the quickness and he pumps out of there and he goes for another first down as he moves the football to the Ohio State 46 yard line he picked up 14 yards on the play before Doug plank brought him down two things on that play Keith there were just great football number one a Michigan people blocked into everybody on that Ohio state line stood him up nobody get off a block created a crack and Bell found the crack and accelerated to it as a good back should and made himself a good play out of it Michigan the ball is at the 46 yard line Peter and Belle setbacks Franklin gives the ball the truck he to the fullback and number 44 is inside the 40 to the 39 before then decree number 88 can make the stop for the Ohio State Buckeyes so now suddenly Michigan punches a hole in the middle of the Ohio State defensive line and they're moving the ball it is second down from the 39 yard line and three as heater picked up seven right up the middle Franklin kicks it turns inside hit at the line of scrimmage spins ahead he gets to about the 36 he will be close to the first down it was Nick bonhomie see a sophomore out of Brentwood New York who made the stop for Ohio State the Michigan Wolverines in their first offensive possession marching 53 yards for the opening touchdown to take a seven nothing lead a 42 yard pass one play from Franklin the Chapman the kick was good at 7 nothing Michigan with 7:15 to go in the first quarter third down a half yard to go for the first down I get the ball the heater he went right into the stack varna me see Cusick the two big tackles got as much of that artificial turf in their fingers as they couldn't hung on let's see whether or not Chuck Ito has picked up the first time they bring the chains on and as they measure let me tell you that the Ohio State Michigan game is one of only several posts competitive rivalries existing throughout the Big Ten these days whenever games match such teams Indiana Purdue Michigan the Michigan State Minnesota Wisconsin you've got plenty of action and excitement guaranteed can kickoff to the final gun and it is up first down all the Wolverines hioh State the defensive line is gonna have to start taking off a little bit better than they are right now they're kind of sitting in there catching a little bit they're not really firing into those people and except on that short yardage play they've been kind of sitting back and getting on catching rather than taking off a little bit I think they're gonna have to start moving closer to stop me from the 36 first down Franklin he took kids at the Bell bell ish of that amount the very late pitch but they do get yardage out of it as Chuck heater was the man leading the play and doing the blocking and Michigan gets a lot of good blocking out of that fullback position and again running that option in the sidelines and boy that Franklin does a great job of holding that football until the very last moment a lot of people that looks easy but boy that takes a lot of poise and confidence to hang on it right up until the end and then let it go and he did that very well he got five yards on the play at second down and five for Michigan at the Ohio State 31 yard line with 645 play in the first quarter at the Gordon Bell comes over left tackle and Bell is down to the 27 yard line before van Decree number 88 makes the tackle Bell has carried seven times he's picked up 43 yards I'd say that left tackle that quick tackle through Michigan is doing a great job he's had two five blocks in that play in a row he's hitting into that man and turning them very well we're looking at third down and two yards to go for Michigan jords Pascucci another tight end comes in it's a double tight end Chapman leaves that gone for the big guys are going to go on for here's the pitch outside the bat we got the first down he's inside the 25 he's at the 22 yard line before Tim Fox and Doug Planck can bring him down they needed to Bella got six honest let's look at the son of Steve Myers in here go I mean Franklin go right into Michigan boy Johnny let's do a great job I like that just a great job good Pennsylvania boy well it's on the 22 yard line of Ohio State Michigan first down 50 to go first quarter Wolverines leading 7 to nothing and marching its Bell again gets our must got outside peach Kuzak number 71 penetrated got a piece of him slowed him down Arnie Jones 42 and then Bonamici put him away just to step away right there to go yep one step that he'd have been headed for the flag he gained to Paulus very near the 20yard line Michigan jumping on top and controlling the football game at the sport Ohio State's first offensive sure it was minus four yards second time they fumbled on the 26 in Michigan Franklin back to throw he gets it all he goes for Smith he missed it good defense by me elbow high Oh state Jim Smith number 37 Dennis Franklin number 9 the quarterback was flattened after the pass this is Smith now in the isolation watching runthrough down here there's a nice rule breaks out and Franklin delivers this fall under a lot of pressure and it's John a target right here and people go up for it great play by closing I think Dennis looked into the middle of that secondary was looking for Chapman Chapman had a crowd three people around it that's right third down and about eight yards to go Smith as Franklin goes to flow again better protection gets it off intended rectum bore incomplete that's not a good throw by Franklin he's got preparing field goal position they we shouldn't throw that ball up for grabs what might be intercepted there that gets me kids up the scoring opportunity but only sure that'll happen once he had bass protection that time Joe I thought perhaps that he could have exercised a little more patience yeah you know you don't want to throw that ball away when you got a chance to get three points from 37 yards 37 yard effort he'll kick it from the 27 10 yards in the end zone Mike lamb three ball is down a tack on breaks hole it is up it is good a 37yard field goal by Mike Landry and with 4 minutes and 57 seconds to play in the first quarter Michigan beat Ohio State 10 to nothing this is Keith Jackson along with Joe Paterno head football coach at Penn State University sitting high atop Ohio Stadium Jim Lampley is with us as we cover the 70 first meeting between the Ohio State Buckeyes and the Michigan Wolverines and with 457 to play in the first quarter Michigan has jumped to a 10 to nothing lead a 53yard drive and a 37yard field goal and Leonard wills not yielding his eyes from the bright Sun it's a clear day it's almost 60 degrees and Willis is back there along with Archie Griffin and Bosch Nagle and winter gets it very very high and Willis looked into the Sun takes it on the fire he comes back to the 19 on the tackle Kim Davis 5628 Tom Drake Michigan let's call it the 20 Terry O'Neill our statistician is right in the first place he wrote down a 15yard return the ball just shy at the 20 yard line Cornelius Green number 7 checks into the Ohio State huddle the Buckeyes are wearing the red shirts Michigan leading 10 to nothing wearing the white Michigan's defense has been most impressive they've stopped Ohio State twice now a schmegle is in motion with Johnson and Griffin behind it and it is jumps in the fullback into the middle he gets a couple of yards and that's all here's Jim Lampley you're watching a lot of Ohio High School football products on both sides of the line of scrimmage today Jan of Michigan's 22 starters are from Ohio 31 players on the roster from Ohio by contrast only six Michigan players on the Ohio State team it's a matter of geography the Ohio State people just don't like to recruit in Michigan Michigan's people love to go to Ohio where the best high school football is keep second down and eight yards to go Archie Griffin trying to pop it over the right side had his feet taken from under him by Tim Davis number 56 the middle guard for Michigan but he did get the football up to just beyond the 25yard line so let's call it third down and a long four for Ohio State the Buckeye field position so far in the game has been the 12 yard line the 20 yard line of the 20 yard line this is the third time they've had the ball and they thrilled 10 to nothing hazal we wide to the left side as dream sets throws quickly a pass is caught by Doug France number 82 tied in the book guys have a first down at the po he gained a 14 yards on at that I do a couple of things like that loosen up those linebackers linebacking is sitting in there awfully tough to the run duck branch 260 pounder converted from tackle to tied in one of the if not the biggest man on the Ohio State team and that football was right on his fingertips and he showed a pair of great hands to hang on to it so let's call it the 40 just outside the forty first down Buckeyes fashioned a goal again in motion it's driven at Archie Griffin his pork fat Dave Brown number six and dragged down as he moves the football for eight yards from the 40 to the 48 brought down by Brown but the hole open on that right side and Archie almost popped out of there but Nick knack the right guard number 69 the blocking at the point of the hole is that excellent yet a nice shot in about second Oh Griffin now six carries 27 yards and as you saw he's gained a hundred yards or more in 21 consecutive games including the Rose Bowl it's second down in two yards to go for Ohio State Cornelius Green keeps it he's got a first down as he reaches the Michigan 45 yard line so with two minutes and 37 seconds to play in the first quarter Ohio State moving again but Michigan Legion tender nothing he looks like he can fly two kids nice hole and he was ready to take off it's like sitting on a keg of dynamite playing defense against these people the last couple of years it's been a defensive struggle today it may be entirely different the way we're starting with it Griffin tries the left side moving it from just outside the 45 down to the 44 got the better part of two yards on the play spring ko number 59 fine lock Becker for Michigan always around the ball playing but a sore knee hurt the knee in the Purdue game but there was no way you could keep him out of this football game and he's the man that went it locked up Archie Griffin alma care let's call it second down and about nine as dream pitches the ball the Griffon big hole right sound jumping is down to the 30yard line they have ground came up from the second area to make the stop 14 yard gain for Archer Griffin another first down for Ohio State Michigan came into the ballgame ten wins and no losses Archie now needs 28 yards to break his own big ten rushing record Ohio State nine and one this game 2nd and 3rd in the UPI poll and Pete Johnson the fullback carries the ball into the middle Tim Davis a middle card makes the stop Johnson became a sensation for Ohio State in the Rose Bowl against Southern California last year when he had a tremendous day as the Buckeyes won that ballgame he's very much a part of the Ohio State offense and he's only a sophomore inside a minute to go now in the first quarter with Michigan leading at 10 to nothing 50 seconds to play Ohio State second down and 7 yards to go the ball is inside the 48 stream keeps the ball Jill occurs after in shirt failed him and drags him down back on the 35 yard line it was Dilek number 81 who made the first contact with green Greg Morton 77 came over to follow him off he lost seven yards that's a big defensive play for Michigan no not only forces higher state in the way a passing situation also good to you and that field goal was back exactly on the 35 yard line of Michigan first quarter is about gone as the clock continues to run were inside 10 seconds now this will be the last play of the first quarter about 14 yards to go as Cornelius Green gets outside he's got one 30 yard line and there he is varied and time has expired at the end of the first quarter at Ohio Stadium in Columbus Ohio Michigan 10 Ohio State nothing Tom Clavin number six is in the lineup he will try a field goal he will hit the football from say the 37 yard line that is a 47yard field goal try he's kicked four out of six this year Ohio State scoreless in the first quarter bad snap it's comes rolling back to him and he's got enough on him 47 yard field goal Tom Clements Ohio State is wrong the board the wind at his back that was a great kick because the snap was born and a juggle a snap but it kept his concentration and his eye on the target and kicked right through the football that is a super kick never another look at it and watch the work of the holder here Brian Bosch Nagle picks up the ball which it on the tee takes this time Clavin kept his poise and drilled it 47 yards but he did have the wind at his back makes you wonder whether maybe Michigan should have called timeout just before they thought it was over made him kick it into the wind incidentally Ohio State failing to score in that first quarter that's the first time this entire season the Buckeyes have not put some points on the school board in the first quarter of the game as you look at the first quarter statistics in Michigan O'Hare state with the two moves beginning to catch up in total yardage Michigan over 100 a hundred and seven the Buckeyes have 84 and the turnover well the Buckeyes turned it over Michigan's returned Gordon Bell Gill Chapman and the kick is beep it goes to Stephanie yard deep in the end zone he got a good block down around the 15yard line to get him back to the 21 21 yard line as frankly gives the football to his fullback Chuck heater and heater takes it to the 26 that's a pickup of about five yards and on the sidelines Ohio State's stepping and holding team getting in some practice second quarter of play just getting underway and it's Michigan ten Ohio State three Michigan and white Ohio State wearing the red Buckeyes have 7 min up along that front the linebackers have moved ratty and tight they gave the ball to Gordon Bell and he hadn't going anywhere against that kind of a defensive alignment gains a yard at the most is Arnie Jones number 42 and linebacker was the first to get it so it brings up third down Arni Jones number 42 step right into the scene right into the crack and came across on the angle with van decree put him away alright Smith number 37 comes live with the wife for Michigan on third down at the 27yard line Denis Franklin slides down the line pitches that fall outside the Bell Bell gets around the corner he's exciting he goes to the 39 yard line before Bruce Elia can run him down he throws a great block by the tight end on that defensive halfback came off the line of scrimmage got in good position and made a good block to give did that hey you seen 84 learn a line of scrimmage and I turns up field gets it going good position right there drives him out and watch that ball carrier turn up inside of me man he took out this 40 60 blue for Michigan from the 40 yard line a place goes up the middle and it's good for almost five maybe it is good for five yards as chuck heater gets a big banging around heater was a halfback previously moved into the fullback spot says he now has finally learned to absorb the punishment that goes with a fullback position look at the total yardage by Michigan to the opponents of the year I'll tell you something about their defense over the five yard game second down and five just shy of the 45 slip he went down going to his left the left ankle is his sore ankle lost a little bit of real estate and six now for Michigan ball is at the 44 my estates got to stop him on one of these thirddown plays get that football pack down in 1644 Michigan four out of five is converting fair town where's Franklin back to flow he gets it over to picked off by Bruce early I to the Michigan 44yard the bass was intended for didn't bore 84 and Presidium fix it often Ohio State has the ball as Michigan leads all right there is Michigan's turnover first of the ball game Ohio State getting the ball at the 44 yard line first down the pressure now will shift over to the Michigan defense you know that's the danger of throwing the ball over the middle sometimes it looks like the receivers wide open but all the sudden the linebacker pops up the pastor's on the quad are actually safer than I was over the middle see if Ohio State can cash it in from the Michigan 44 he's really popped as he comes to the line of scrimmage he I don't think he gained much on that place sprinkle 59 Larry banks 32 really nailed it have a look gets a drink oh now as he smells the ball see sprinkle makes a nice move up into the line then comes laterally was in between those two plots and then he really pops him like he's supposed to hit him gets head head in there and watch them a little bit knocks him back second down and 10 Ohio State Michigan 24 mr. Griffin again Griffin makes a taco he breaks two tunnels and he goes down to the Michigan 38 yard line string Co had him he ran right through him that time so it looks to me like Joe that string Co is the man who's told every time Griffin moves you go with it well he's he's reacting to the flow on here he's in fine position but as he hits he doesn't quite wrap he doesn't quite get those arms around that powerful thighs that Griffin has and Griffin breaks it runs over it was in great position gained six yards there now takes it down to the Michigan 25 first down made this top 14 yard gain for Griffin Bart osek 87 in prance out for Ohio simulating numbers again to back and carries one more time he's inside the 20th under the 17 yard Banks brings him down he took it for eight yards and he should have broken his own big ten rushing record with that carry depends on exactly where they put it they put it at the 17 he does have 8 yards he's now picked up 70 yards involuntary Ohio State is starting to work into the sidelines there as we thought Michigan would against the higher state there Michigan's got their wolf man out they do peck out to the open feel in the Ohio State running back in hearing to the sidelines Cornelius cream keeping the ball no place to go the play was not today did not developed as it was conceived and green was suddenly left naked out there and he lost five yards do packed the Wolfman makes the stop number 35 see this time my estate decided to go the open feel and do Peck was in great position all the losses back to the 22 yard line where it is down and seven for Ohio at the Michigan 22 bash Nagaland motion Green gives the ball defeat Johnson the fullback coughed it up but he was down before he released the ball and the advance of the football to about the nineteen so it'll bring up a fourth down they need three yards better had better part of four yards really fourth down and four they go for the field goal again and I don't see flavorman they're going for a Keith tough call tough decision Woody Hayes made it fourth down for at the Michigan 19 we gotta figure Griffin he he's got the best Archie Griffin goes to the 11 year do parachuter a man just missed it Griffin now 13 carries in 78 yards what a gut tough play that was great a great execution and great running first down Ohio State at the Michigan 11 Michigan leading 10 to 3 with 7:35 Griffin again runs into the right side and gets to the nine Rick kosher middle guard 92 made the stop Tim Davis out of there hobbled off the field a moment ago I think about you just kept that thing a little bit wider he had a nice crack to the outside but I think he's so determined go in and get three or four that he might have missed it oh just a little bit to the outside he hit you in great blocking just inside the nyah second down gets a couple of yards maybe the 7 yard line Calvin O'Neil 96 linebacker pearling or 97 tackle they're Lucilia the man who intercepted in his Franklin's past which gave ohio state possession at the Michigan 44 Elio was a fullback last year when Henson got hurt Elia stepped in and played fullback forward to find athlete went back to his first love line backing this year it is third down the ball is just inside the 8 yard line of Michigan Cornelius green looking for gap in the line there was nothing there purling errs Morton both of them pinching in and sealed him off with help from Co Shaq so now here is 4th down the ball is at the Michigan 8 yard line fourth down they need 7 yards for a first down and 8 yards for the touchdown if they go for the field goal and they will as Clayton comes in it'll be a 25 yard field goal try from the 15 Bosch Nagel gets another bad snap but gets it down the kick is up and it is good so Tom Clavin it's a 47yard field goal Doug Porter is a freshman in doing the snapping for the kicks for Ohio State and again that snap was a little off target but Bosch Nagel is a pretty good shortstop antal had ball well and play bone is drilled it Gill Chapman now number 24 is the deep man standing at the goal line flanking him or Gordon Ohio State getting two field goals from Tom Clavin trail in the ball game by a score of 10 to 6 Michigan has been very quiet offensively here in the second quarter the first quarter they pumped together in the endzone bill and Chapman and they will down it there and Michigan will have the football first down at the 20 yard line watch bash Nagel here number 48 holder now watching welcomes Scouten back inside right at the shoe top scoops it up handles it with soft hands puts it on the tee and Clavin popped it right through my fashion Eagles are great athlete great another good Pennsylvania boy a lot of good old Pennsylvania boys gonna be busting helmets Thanksgiving night that's in Penn State we will see it over most of these ABC stations at 9:00 that is Franklin the tailback he tries to go up the right side there's nothing there but a mass of humanity he'll get a yard out of the play since Dennis Franklin threw the touchdown pass a 42 yards to Gill Chapman he's open three and has had one intercepted but his football team the Michigan Wolverines wearing the white leading by a score of 10 to 6 with 5:25 to go in the first half got it gets around the corner turnings running right into that sore ankle the left ankle made his cut on it move the ball up to about the 28 8 yard line for picked up the 7 on the play and Kim tune number 54 Ohio State linebacker made the stop here's Jim Lampley Archie Griffin handled most of the road working that last drive on Gibby legs he's got a hip pointer on the left hip he's got a thigh bruise on his right thigh they handled ice pack on him for a short period of time and he'll definitely play some more he got that hip corner incidentally in that 16:13 loss to Michigan State yes Dennis the corner again getting across the 30 to the 32 he's got a first down for the Michigan Wolverines Tim Fox number 12 safety man the stop for Ohio State he didn't have any of that last night nor will you have it tonight between these two it is second down very short yardage for the first down from the 42 Green turns it inside gets his first down as he runs it out to the Ohio State 48 yard line Tim Davis cut his feet from under him and the clock now stopped as the change removed with 21 seconds to play in the first half Michigan leading 10 to 6 over Ohio State lean back once the flow does get it off goes to the sideline mastered the hazel he's 26 yard line of Michigan 10 seconds to play 25 yard gain right now they're right on the verge of he'll go rain he's got what 10 seconds they may go for the kick right now I don't know I think they have one timeout left at one timeout left they may run it call timeout and then kick it his appears the bass plays a hazel he kind of just drifted out there in that right flat green moved around scrammed a little bit spun them threw the ball out there Ohio State with one timeout remaining only 10 seconds remaining on the clock here in the first half I would imagine they'll run that ball to the left over here give it to Griffin or tackle left try to get a right in the middle of the goal post goes instead of the left to the right where the ball is going to be on the right hash mark as Cal O'Neill makes the stop for Michigan with six seconds play in the first half so Bosch Nagel comes in to hold it and Tom Clavin junior out of Cincinnati who's kicked to 47 yarder he's kicked to 25 yarder will now try a 43yard field goal for Ohio State here's Jim there was a big brown on the Ohio State bench just then when Archie Griffin went the wrong way obviously was supposed to bring the ball back toward the middle of the field so they could get a better angle on the field goal Griffin went outside instead of coming back that way and everybody on the bench turned around and went oh no keep well Flavin's aside wheeler he wheels into its soccer style so soccer kickers normally hooked the ball a little bit anyways maybe it won't matter that much we'll see he's got the wind at his back I find it very hard to fold Archie Griffin for anything and I'll blanket you 43yard effort he hooked it all right he with only two seconds gets his nerd he'll go another look at it now watch fast Nagel my older well he's been handling the ball all day this time he went for the holder three for three in a pressure ballgame like this not too bad for that job that's what a great kicks that one had a lot of dishes a lot of height I would imagine now they're probably onside kick this thing I doubt they take a deep with two seconds ago ten to nine take the little chip shot short it goes to Teflon down at the 8 yard line and Chapman his track down and the first half is over so after 30 minutes of football here Ohio Stadium we have just about what we expected a struggle they halftime statistics this is Keith Jackson along with Joe Paterno Penn State football coach Jim Lampley we're ready to go the second half of play and in the first half they come off relatively even Ohio State holding an edge in time of possession the turnovers evened out at one apiece offensive plays Ohio State 37 and Michigan had 31 and on the scoreboard where it is most important they're also very even with miss Gill Chapman number 24 in white goes deep for Michigan he's flanked by Gordon Bell and Rob little kicking off will be squad a knee for Ohio State Tom Scott any era Bethel Park Pennsylvania same place at the Michigan center Dennis Frank's comes from with about a 20 mile an hour knocked it completely off the playing surface Michigan will put it in play first down at the 20 yard line and the Wolverines opened like this along the front with Smith King Lewis Frank's armor tum pain and din bore and in the backfield they will have Dennis Franklin number 9 Gordon Bell will be the tailback number 5 Chuck he 244 is the fullback and Gill Chapman will be the wing back that's the way they line up or Ohio State offensively along the front the more down men will be wanna deceive meet kusik and jim koch and here we go when gives the ball the Gordon Bell and when he goes to the 23 for a pickup of three yards as linebacker Arnie Jones and Nick bonhomie see the left tackle the linebackers for Ohio State 36 elia 42 Jones 9 Kim Thompson number 20 Neal cozy 46 Steve loop 28 duck plank and Tim Fox number 12 all the deep end defensively Jim Zira comes in no it is Dave Nets in replacing perk Lewis at the left guard position ol Michigan on second down and seven Franklin pitches the ball to ball swiftleft cuts it back against the grain and he gets it up to the 27 28 yard line before Elia Bruce Elia who had a pass interception in the first half makes the stop have a look at his yeah look what you stick forces to play back in they wanted to go outside and watch Illya here following along the line of scrimmage e it's even there he goes boom I didn't pick tack but Gordon Bell is now past a hundred yards he has carried 19 times and gained 102 yards he is the leading ball carrier in this game he have gained more yardage than Archer Griffin so far Archie has 89 yards and 17 carry on third down in two yards to go Franklin gives the bell Bell trying to get outside he capped and decrees number 88 and Doug Planck number 28 puffed up the ball but they're going to call the ball down at about the 27 yard line and Michigan this is the second punt in a ball game last year they punted 12 times in this ballgame gotta get the feeling at the moment that Ohio State is the one that's really breathing fire but we'll see as we begin the second half great pressure on the punter Anderson John Anderson gets it off a short jacket goes to bash Nagle across midfield State has the football first at the Michigan 48 yard line 30 yards on the punt and a 10yard return and along the front for Ohio State it'll be French q Marcus Smith Myers Mac family hazel and in the backfield Cornelius green at quarterback Archer Griffin at tailback either Hynson or johnson at fault soon as they break out little detailer for you and Bosch Nagel oohing back it'll be Pete Johnson number 33 the big sophomore he's up 246 founder after Michigan 48yard they go to Griffin and he is nailed at the line of scrimmage but he goes up over the top he'll get a yard out of the effort as Jeff Hullinger number 97 was the man who put the pad to it you see some scores from the other traditional games around the country start LIF has jumped ahead of Penn in the second quarter Cornell and Princeton having at it nothing nothing Maryland and Virginia nothing in the Blue Devils are leading north carolina's sever nothing it is here at Ohio Stadium and Michigan as we start the second half second down and nine Griffin from the 47 to the 44 for three more yards so he's got a total of 91 yards so far in the ballgame he's a new tree arch what's the music Griffin is really hurting a little bit he didn't hit that hole quite as quick as he should've and it's good I don't know whether you know with that hip pointer he's having a little trouble pushing off out of his stance well he's got a hip corner on one side the bruised eye on the other but he's a package of determination here they go third down five from the 44 gets away from j\u00fclich he gets the first down turns it outside and run are that's the thing that drives defensive coaches nuts quarterback got him hung up and you lose leverage on him people on the backside contained a little careless and hit his quickest green my ball is at the 33 yard line of Michigan first down Ohio State Michigan has led all the way they would have had seven nothing and then nothing three field goals by Tom Cleveland has pulled it back to ten nine but guys moving again is free to beat Johnson the fullback Johnson certainly didn't gain and the thing may have lost something as Tim Davis number 56 the middle guard penetrated for Michigan a big 97 bourlingueur 235 pounds junior out of Crystal Minnesota played a lot of defensive tackle this afternoon for those Michigan Wolverines to there was a loss on the play I'm about a half yard second down it's best nickel in motion Green throws it misses last night coming to the sidelines and right with him was Tom Drake the defensive halfback or the world the Big Ten statement regarding the vote on the team who represent the Big Ten in the Rose Bowl if Michigan wins retires the vote will be conducted by phone probably decided right here Ohio Stadium if Ohio State wins the football game the victim athletic directors convene in Chicago tomorrow and there they will catch their ballots tries to get out of it she picks up yardage all right down to about the 27 yard line before Carl Russ brings him down for Michigan but he is short of the first down so here quickly is Jim you see the Buckeye leaves that are planted on the back of the Ohio State helmet by any kind of achievement on the football field it's worth noting it can be a key tackle it can be a long run it can be an interception it can be a key block they are just like the yellow footballs that are on the back of the Michigan helmets which also signify those kinds of accomplishments keep Jackson alright Jim we're going to have another field goal by Tom Clayton he's picked three of them he's going for his fourth and it's a 45 yard effort with a win on the first time to play in the third quarter going into this final quarter of play very important factor as the teams reverse directions on the field Michigan now will have at their back so higher state leads 1210 it is third down and three yards to go for Michigan the ball at their own 43 yard line turns the corner he's got his first down Denis Franklin making that outside defender commit kept the ball and turned it in for the first down and as you look at the third quarter statistics the score tells you just as much as those numbers tell you it is a very even football in the third quarter the defense took over Michigan gained only 35 yards Ohio State only 48 yards Franklin get the ball on first down from the Michigan 47 and heater works his way to midfield Jim Koch number 19 9 91 on the bottom of that five mile state all the squares at midfield and we got a Buckeye hurt on the field time taken for just a moment Nick Bona me see sophomore tackle out of Brentwood New York shaken up on the play and will come out of the ballgame with 14 22 to fly at O'Hare state still waiting at 12 to 10 well here we are second down seven yards to go for Michigan bio state leading 1210 mr. Gordon Bella field his legs taken from under him bye Bruce Elia linebacker who came hiring in Eze Elia he reads the play and plugs now this is so well the high estates gonna have to be they're gonna have to get in there and stop Michigan now and not let him get in position for a field goal because then they've got to play behind with the wind in their face and I don't want to do that they don't have to throw that football if they don't you know in order to get caught up Ilia force eleven assists one interception so far down and seven yards to go the path way by Elia was the fact that he forced Michigan into a passing situation all right watch it here as Smith Kim Smith the intended receiver comes out cuts to the sidelines on the out pattern now what scolds it time it just step right in front of him and here we go back in the live action first on their own 39 yard line the handoff is to Archie Griffin the junior out of Columbus and normally when you get that kind of a flag thrown from that direction it's holding stuff penalty if the place stands and it will not back it up that would have put Archie Griffin over a hundred yards for a twenty second consecutive ball game some of the scores from around the country a 15yard penalty but Ohio State Tennessee and Kentucky at halftime of the Vols leading 13 nothing winner of that one will go against Maryland in the Liberty Bowl which you'll see over most of these ABC special louis back at the 27 yard line for ohio state and they will have to go to the 49 yard line to get a first down as pete johnson runs it up the middle I don't think the Ohio State's going to get careless and just throw that football even though they've got long yardage they may go on a roll out and the guys wide open for the football or green or running but I don't think they want to think passing down in an hour right now it is second down and 20 yards to go for the Buckeyes Griffen he gets away they had him nailed and he slid out of there moved it from the 29 out to about the 32 that gives him 99 yards for the game and look at that the second quarter that game is in Lincoln and Nebraska goes into the Sugar Bowl against Florida which you'll see although most of these ABC stations Oklahoma will spend the holidays at home it is third down and 18 yards to go Ohio State green on a roll you're not going to put it up he's hip as he tried to cut back against the green by Tim Davis and knocked down at the 35 yard line that will ring up fourth down and Ohio State leading in the ballgame 12 to 10 with 11 35 to play we'll have to find Baylor and SMU if the Baylor Bears win net the Baptist's are gonna be in the Cotton Bowl for the first time in their history it's kinda interesting away I would say so because Joe Paterno's Nittany Lions will be in the Cotton Bowl New Year's Day here's the kickflip a knee he is stuff kind of a putter it is brown round to get Running Room back Ohio State 54 yards on the putt and he hit it into a 20 mile an hour wind 2 yard return and we've got 11 minutes and 6 seconds to play to the Bucks leading 12 to 10 all right Michigan has the football first down they have marked it at the Michigan 13 yard line where it is first down for the Wolverines to win the third back only 11 minutes and six seconds to play in the ball game leading well Denis Franklin all to his flowback Chuck Peter and he crosses the 15 gets it to the 16 maybe a little bit more than that Elia and Cusick who have been defensive Giants for Ohio State in this ball game sometimes the fans wonder why a hoste wouldn't throw the football when they would third down and kick a like they're playing defense now that you played a little bit safer than you would ordinarily if you didn't have good defense and good kicking Peter gained four yards second down and six puts it up Chapman's got it he's in the second area first down at the 30 yard line Tim Fox number 12 to stop for Ohio State 13yard pickup and an isolated look at bill Chapman they gave they gave the line back of the bait they fake to the fullback and linebacker went up in and left that Ally why don't I stayed from playing so aggressively against the run if Michigan's got to do some of those things to keep them keep those linebackers all the running quote ball is on the 31st canal remember the wind is at the back Michigan has a five field goal kicker in Lantry Ohio State leads by two there goes bitch he takes a wallop from coke number 91 as he starts to turn the corner Steve Luke 46 had come out of the defensive secondary to help on the play advance of the ball to the 36 yard line that's a big six yard pickup on first down leaves him second down for Bell now 25 carries 109 yards he's the leading ball carrier in the and we have Lydell in but it is Chuck key to the fullback breaking it over the right side running behind hat from paying and Jim firmer box and Elia bring him down it's a first down for Michigan 13yard pickup a little fullback Chuck heater Bob Lytle he's in at tailback now 90 pound sophomore from Fremont Ohio the ball is at the 48 yard line of Michigan Wolverines first down nine minutes 10 seconds to play in the game on a high o state leading by two 12 to 10 Peter inside not much gets the midfield at that time the Ohio State linebackers read it all the way you could see him step right into the gap Elia Kuhn both those linebackers step right over the holes and rooms for Peter to go that time he got just on pure muscle and momentum of his offensive line two yards to midfield where it is second down and eight eight and a half minutes to play in the game gets it off the sidelines passport by Gill Chapman he is out of bounds he's a yards short of the first down and Steve Luke was all over it and he's still caught it it's a dangerous troll that's a great catch great throw he's right in there can't fight any battle zone it is third down and one at the 43yard line of Ohio State born Avicii has come back into the defensive line for first down for Michigan desi weeps and just put his head down and reach the 39 yard line Peter and Franklin both are in front of him USC UCLA USC UCLA at 4:00 Eastern Time over most to these stations and Anthony Davis needs nine yer against the UCLA Bruins break OJ Simpson right now I think I think right now hi states going to take a little chance on defense and try to get Michigan in the second and 12 something like that they've got to stop them Franklin gives up a heater heater running behind some pain and armor elia and Jones the linebackers make the stop on him he got a couple of yards and we have 7 minutes and 40 seconds to play in the ball game I'm going to say it one more time the wind is at the back of Michigan that is very important because if they can get that ball down within reasonable field goal range Michael entry will get a helping hand from Mother Nature remember it was went through last year who missed a 44 yard try that might have won the game for Michigan Tenten second down Peke Cusick has five solo tackles and six assists and once again our cameraman our director Andy sidari's editor producer Chuck Howard right on top of the right man at the right time but this guy is something it's impossible to control it I'll tell you come he comes off the football like that and drives into an offensive manner very few people don't be able to get him back like the line of scrimmage he's just forcing that bracha back into the back big play here third down and 12 from the 41 Princeton's gonna put it up those with it to the sidelines cannot catch it and it is fourth down for Michigan at the Ohio State 42 yard line now what do you do it would be a 59yard effort in a field goal which we used to say was absurd but I remember a fellow who kicked 163 one time I think I'm pretty sure they were fun I don't know but I can't breathe but I think they hoped they could play good defense now they're gonna go up the field good thing they've lost him to the Air Force Academy owns the NCAA record at sixty I believe early anyway Lawson's kicked one from sixty this is actually on the 48 it's a 58yard that effort and it is short by about ten yard the record of a guy of Southern Mississippi 61 and that's right by my clinch we came up short so it worked out all right men Michigan gives up the ball Ohio state gets it up to 20 and if they had fun it it might have been the same that's not a bad play by any standard anything by punting that they might have been able to get that ball down inside to ten and pull over more pressure on our state but they know the range of that kicker how good he is he can give it a good shot last year Lantry just barely missed one 458 so he missed that wing by about ten yards all right we have six minutes and 20 seconds to blaze Ohio State gets the ball back and gives it to Archie Griffin from the 20 he runs it out to about the 20 to slides off and he's finally brought down about the 20yard lines and they'll probably market at about the 20 here's Jim the small gaggle of Michigan supporters here in Ohio Stadium get more and more worried as the clock ticks on and there's an incredible irony building here on this Michigan team our 20 seniors who even if they lose today will have racked up over the last three years the best record in college football but they've never been to a bowl game that's the pressure that builds right here Keith they give Griffin's advance up to the 22 yard line gives him 101 yards spring the passes complete hello senior out of zinnia number 82 goes for an Ohio State first down up at the 39yard a gain of 18 yards on the I doubt you're gonna show the defect here what's toothpick oh right in on green and green really keeps his cool we've added a fake and just throws that thing right through his hands a great fight that's a clutch core but it was won at Ohio State had to make I think he had to have a first down and I think it was a great call of great players a fine five minutes and 20 seconds to play in the bowl 12 to 10 give it a griffon from the 39yard about the forty two or three more yards of that pass that green just put up and completed a hazel was his first completion in the second half the Michigan defense must hold if Michigan is to have a chance the Buckeyes get it down and there they go for three twentyfive times this year is driven 70 or more yards to school with us through the middle and gets across the 45 to the 46 and it's Tim Davis on the stop for Michigan so now Ohio State will be looking at a third down from their own 46 yard line and three to go go to the 49 to get the first down third down and three this might be a time Michigan's defense should gamble oh they'll gamble of the up there those linebackers will be tight and they'll be coming offensive left tackle for Ohio State our left guard Ted Smith moves before the snap procedure call against Ohio State that'll back em up five you see the time four minutes and three seconds to play this is a time before higher states get anything that they haven't shown that they've saved any kind of reverse or something where they could maybe get that first down without having to throw the football well they've got something special say sometimes disabled play for just a situation like this third down and eight around the 41 give us the Bosch Nagel cutting back on the counter and the wing back gets maybe two yards and that's all and so Michigan holds him it'll be fourth down io state will have to kick it it was Jeff bourlingueur number 97 who refused to move on that play he did not take the fake he just waited got his man we were on the same page they went with the counter I don't know if they had a wide reverse it might have been a little help them out a little bit there all right young duck Porter freshman out of Youngstown comes in to snap the ball robbed title one of the beef man as Fellini does not get the big kick this time it's going to be returned by Tom Drake for Michigan and Drake brings it back to the dirty just outside the dirty that times Petain he got 32 yards on his punt Drake returned it for Michigan has the ball the three minutes and five seconds to play in the with three minutes and four seconds to play in the game Ohio State leading 12 one would think that time would be the perhaps not yet Michigan has the ball first time Lytle is the tailback one Bell was hurt mass going deep for Chaplin too long incomplete he went for the bomb and was not close and Cusick was all over it Hey look I don't think they want us just come out start throwing that football right away I mean you know all the time he's got a lot of time 2 minutes and 58 seconds but all that timeouts left got plenty of time to put together a good Drive get him in field goal position I think right now maybe they go with the draw some Sun plated would get him maybe five or six full pressure in that state he finds him a third and fourth but bail is not injured we rebut Bible impressed big strong runner we'll throw again gets it up throws for Smith and missed him Jim Smith the intended receiver and again kissing is after the quarterback and have a look at Cusick number 71 he really is playing football there's a great football player he is making Franklin aware of his presence related as Chuck said and the offensive lineman and one of them he's got his attention to crazy it is third down and for Michigan Arne Jones and Nick let me save I could cut him down Michigan will have 31 seconds to play in the game chuckles Joe Paterno but because it gets my vote as the defensive player of the ball he has quite a great game with the other tackle and that one had a great play he quite awful but there you know we came into this ball game everybody talking about the Michigan defense and Ohio State's defense was suspect that they have played a great game accepted at one pass Anderson's punt nobody back to return it for Ohio State the Buckeyes will let it roll if Ohio State hangs on to win the ballgame the athletic directors of the Big Ten Conference will all fly to Chicago they will meet there tomorrow and there they will cast their ballots for the team to represent the big 10 in the Rose Bowl against the Pacific a champion I'm flippin the four field goals you saw him there just to give the ball to Pete Johnson the Michigan defense worms are in at the 26 yard line a gain of one yard and now Michigan will have to start spending some of its timeouts you have three per head that's the first one Michigan now with two remaining timeout fiftyone seconds to play I escaped 12 Michigan 10 and we'll be right back Dennis Franklin frustrated on the sidelines the Michigan quarterback watching hoping that lightning will strike in the favor of the Wolverine fiftyone seconds to play in the fourth sucking down my fire state owns the bowl it's given a Bosch Nagel the wingback reversing gets it out to the 30 Jeff Hullinger 97 on the taco here at Ohio Stadium in Columbus Bo Schembechler in watchings there is nothing else that he can do except think Ohio State owns the ball third down and five actually if they can stop and now make them kick and get any time to return they're still in pretty good position a minute and 43 seconds to play in the game green rolling pork dropped for a loss back at the 22 yard line Tim Davis number 56 who's been an outstanding football player number 77 for Michigan Greg Martin right there with him now higher state backed up to its 22 yard line on fourth down will have to punt it Tom Clayton number 6 from Cincinnati Ohio or field goals four in a row Ohio State the lead 1210 squad a knee fair catch Michigan has the ball first down 47yard the winds today nee got only 30 yards on the kick and 57 seconds to play in the game Calvin O'Neil comes pouring in and he decks the kicker but an official was standing right there we're the kicker's foot was here's the pot here Antonio put this down I don't think that I don't think he worked to kick oho good I think all right Michigan's last chance there 47 yard line 57 seconds to play two timeouts remaining Franklin puts it up throws for Smith he's 30 Ohio State work stops as they move the chains 52 seconds to play they took the back and brought him inside and then brought Smith in right you almost this is a trail kind of pattern picked the right guy he had a choice to be the Hitman Chapman or hating Smith and he's cooking he picked the right guy Ohio State leads by only to Franklin goes to the sideline stops the clock since Smith in that direction and now you see 46 seconds to play on second down and 10 from the 32 yard line the ball is closer to the 32 for Michigan I think Michigan's got one timeout left is that right one timeout okay they're in pretty good position you know they can throw and maybe running one in there and call timeout after the run if they want it still being a pretty good position to kick for that field goal around 10:00 he breaks it over the middle he's down to the 22 yard line before Locke springs him down close to a first down and that will stop the clock again with 39 seconds Michael entry number 36 the place kicker for the university of michigan wolverines he picked the 37 yarder in the first quarter to make it a 10 nothing Michigan lead the two teams get a deep breath here it is a first down for Michigan the Ohio State 22 yard line 39 ticks remaining on the clock football game that clock starts as soon as the official walks away from that ball even if they're first down and missed anybody get up on that line of scrimmage Mike Lantry who had a chance to win it last year they get his chance again this year the tailback he blows it over the right side he goes to the 16 yard line and now 18 seconds how they go to that time out there let's go to Jim I'm not on camera once again pressure is apparently coming down on the shoulders of Mike Plan tree the Michigan field goal kicker remember that twice in the last five minutes a year ago Landry missed field goals that would have won the ballgame for Michigan and sent them to the Rose Bowl remember that he hasn't had a great year this year before last week he was four for 13 on the year and the Michigan coaches were worried about his kicking remember that he's missed his last two attempts today both of them were long ones now back up to keep Jackson it will be a 33 yard try as Mike Lantry has come on he will kick out of the hold of Tom Drake he's a remarkable story he is from Oxford Michigan he was a walkoff he just showed up one day I've said coach I want to play football for you he right now might very well write his name indelibly in Michigan football history one of the richest collegiate history books of them all he is a left footed kicker 37 ureter this one is from 33 yards the wind is at his back only 18 seconds to play in a ball the placement is good the ticket is with 16 seconds the Azlan braveness from third why security people are trying to clear the peanut what's disconsolate way to the sideline Joe Paterno had looked like everything went just fine I thought I thought he had it from this angle what I just wanna make one a Greek college football game decision regardless of winning or losing has been enough glory on this football field today for two squirrels it's been a great football game all right let's have another look and we're going to be as we look at it a little bit of an angle down here's the snap it is good breaks hold is just fine LAN twist kick is in the air and it is up in the air it well it's impossible to tell from this angle he missed it to the left side so apparently the ball had not crossed when it veered just to the outside of the uprights and it's got to go in between the uprights not over them but in between em it was waved off by the officials as no good now the field has been clear and we have 16 seconds to play in the game and it will be 16 small hard seconds for Michigan Prudential College for show for you right after our ball game and then at four o'clock Eastern Time USC of UCLA over most of these ABC stations as play Nia screen takes the snap boils down to ticks on the clock and then the penalty flag is dropped by the official but everything is academic I would think from here on as a high Oh state leads 1210 Michael entry with a chance to win it for Michigan missing from 33 yards now remember the athletic directors of the Big Ten Conference are to come in to Chicago tomorrow and vote one more look at it there is absolutely no way to tell from here as to where the ball was over the crossbar it looked good in so far as the uprights for concern but at this point you can myself to agree with a man in the striped shirts on the field the clock starts on the game it over the 70 first football game between Ohio State and Michigan most exciting of the law one of the most dramatic of them all and for Michigan perhaps one of the most heartbreaking of them all the final score for what he Hayes and his Ohio State Buckeye they have 12 points on four field goals from Tom Clavin who is our offensive player of the game Pete kusik defensive tackle our defensive player of the game the general scholarship fund at Ohio State University will receive a total of $2,000 in the name of those two gentlemen from Chevrolet final score 1210 Ohio State wins",

three second down seven Southern Cal go high off aged 38 USC ahead three nothing 10:25 to go in the first period more didn't carry the ball much this year 440 carries by the tailback 40 carries by the floor back all right say it in automatic they were playing very wide defensively beautifully he hands it off they hid behind the flow the hole is there fresh pretty world he is a tremendous competitor this young and what a block he was a tailback in high school here he is again look at he picked that wade away with a feat of good fullback should do he escape Middleton there and they hit made by Steve Lou Davis trying to slant off the left side no games Pete Kuzak the strongest man in the Ohio State team number 71 a weight lifter Woody Hayes was giving a lecture one time and was exploiting the late Harry Truman the greatest man he'd ever known and Kuzak said what about Charles Atlas second down ten USDA Ohio State's 26 hate this box down on the 30 the next time an agent passes notice how DP drops 10 12 sometimes 15 yards sets up very deeply Barney Jones and Randy Gradishar in there dumping for the loss back to the Ohio State 30 okay the thing we were talking about before is the diversity of the Trojan team we have not seen we saw one draw we have not seen two three we have not seen Lynch squad on a reverse they use that rather frequently just to keep the team off side the screen Neal called the over covering Lynn Swann therefore the passes to him have not been on target they've been around him and here's bristle Lima hey Luth coming in again get the longest field goal of his career just a couple of minutes ago a 47yard er he's five five 135 pounds another 47 yard attempt this kick back Ohio state holes and the Buckeyes will take over under 20 yard while the pop guys fly it up and get ready to try to move the ball to score USC 3 Ohio State Archie Griffin 20 year he's had first sophomore in the 50year history of the Big Ten Conference win the Most Valuable Player Award he was a total he gained 1428 yards this year every game he played he went over at least 100 yards sometimes the only played half the game second down three Ohio State on his 27 they're trailing three nothing that bring fashion Eagle in motion the wing back all right meeting party doors the middle guard playing on the nose whichever way he goes that man is going to go opposite Ohio State as their first first down of the game they're on their 33 yard line when you get a closeup of Archie Griffin look at his neck and shoulders and upper body he breaks for tacklers than any runner Ohio State's ever had goes to the air held the linebackers wear the playaction hits his tight end punished by the way his entire family here at 13 and they fan and a traveling band from Pennsylvania they came here he is just a freshman he dragged three Michigan players across the goal line five yards out it's the Long Beach New York weighed 236 they want him to lose about 10 pounds next year be a little quicker he can be one of their alltime great fullback and they've had a line of them now on the 37 of USD second down a yard ago now state on the move Sims 40 185 Mitchell the outside linebacker and the freshman Gary Jeter from Cleveland Ohio the number one prospect in the state of Ohio left Ohio and came the USC here at the Manor trying to beat his money Doris Polydorus plays head up on the center who linebackers rich wood 83 generally places left 55 Chuck Anthony generally placed was right if you read the brothers to hit up let's see if they can get us they ahead three nothing Ohio State has a third and 1 on the USC 37 Archie Brooklyn he squirms across the USB 35 to the USB 34 the middle of guard Monte Doris tackle team number 72 all right they're jamming in there Steve Myers in the center just trying to get that first now that's the boy you need to do that's the strength you were talking about Curt o'Barr cheese recipe he was a wrestler in high school though with Anthony Davis first out of state they have driven from their own 20 yard line Archie Griffin again suddenly closed up by Monty doors who tackled him from behind slid over from the left line package by three younger brothers on their way to Ohio State and of two yards second down eight a typical Ohio State timeconsuming play eating drive second down eight or Neely a screen puts them down coming through chief Johnson and he's through the 26 yard line of USC nailed there by Richard wood 83 in Charles Anthony 55 tackles they could not handle the linebacker body Doris is a good they know they've got to stop him that that's their Achilles heel right yo chips come in a cream be constant again they run that big fullback up the middle and it's a first down Ohio State game sim faculty pretty hey Alice always loves that full back up the middle and he's using this freshman right now as he always loved to have big great tackle the Shumacher and Hicks he's got two outstanding offensive eight Johnson four carries in a row he's right at the 20 yard line for the two middle linebackers wouldn't Anthony nailed him second down seven the goal for Ohio State and a timeout has been called by the University of Southern California big Johnson Monte Doris the middle guard waiting for him that time right off the nose of the said Kurt it's a oneonone block you also get some good health for jimsim from the outside nice play straighten your man up drive for linebacker comes to help out now I'm surprised are running to fall back that much they have it all year they figure if there's to live backers are going to stand stand up in the halls of guards couldn't blow them out if the center could handle multi doors it could be a very big play and now how straight is called a timeout this is Cornelius green coming to the sideline a sophomore Washington DC Ohio State has never had a sophomore as quick as this man he was the second leading runner on the team very quick feet and has beautiful balance hard to knock down I wouldn't be surprised to see him take off on the option player very shortly and back in a pull back now is Bruce Elia which may mean a change in the Ohio State offensive strategy right now crucio as we mentioned earlier as it wasn't linebacker young man out of Cliffside Park New Jersey cliffside high he is a great blocker we saw him block at some of the films of the Ohio State coach he showed us at number 36 to table coming up next the 1974 Orange Bowl game for Miami LSU Penn State NBC Sports number one in live coverage of major sports events all year round it's a third and six Dave hazel is a wide receiver to the left Ohio State on the USB 19 in there on him Bonnie course number 72 and Jim Sims 41 to put a tremendous pass rush on Cornelius dream fourth and sixth Ohio State on the USC 19 and now the little place kickers on 155 pounds Blair Conway from Middleburg Heights Ohio who kicked five out of ten he is going to fry a 36yard field goal ash Nagel is holding I think USC is offside the kick is up and kick is no good he was offside on the play I thought I saw that blur a bite on the right side some strategy will put the ball on the 14 yard line they'll have 1/4 of one going back Archie Griffin chief Johnson into the Ohio State backfield that right side was offside offside USC outs on the 14 yard line and Ohio State will have a fourth down and one yard to go so what he does he gamble but he doesn't run the key for me blasting and how's the first down maybe not measure first you get an angle up here hi looking one way they want to be sure on this one so to bring the chain gang on for the measurement my estates had a 13 play drive first a fans like it thousands here they continue to jam the middle Kurt defensively and wisely trying to force my estate to the outside Dale Mitchell may have a big assignment he's playing white one of the linebacker Ohio State on the USD 13 James Sims and Charles Anthony he accelerates very quickly first time he carried the ball 18 years old he fumbled then he went on to rack up 239 yards in his first varsity game against North Carolina which broke a 21year ohio state single game rushing record at time up again by Ohio State they have used two timeouts in this period it's kind of interesting now the weight first of all we've got to keep the by this when you're playing a kind of possession football that Ohio State plays you must it's absolutely essential essential that you score three points here would be a defeat for Iowa State they want the touchdown of course that'll dry here so far ladies and gentlemen a state of just six and a half minutes in this drive they've come from their 20yard line the USDA's dark they have a second down and five to go to the freshman fullback 236 pounds of him blast it down by Richard wood the middle linebacker USD and Dale Mitchell the left linebacker this fellow scuffling up the middle for a freshman he is that offensive line is showing me something this is a very good upgrade Ohio State team well you heard woody on our pregame show is this the best whenever he'll tell you after the Rose Bowl game this 54 68 teams won them all including a Rose Bowl that's short of foot and he wants to wait and see how they do against the very fine USC team today third down and a foot to go over Ohio State on the USC three yard line three and a half yard line a minute and a half to play in the first period USC ahead leader nothing fathers a chief of police with Ken Ohio again blasting just started to go away Richard would hit him there but he appears to have the first and goal to go Ohio State's on the 2 yard line of USC first and goal ago old bull hasti again gostin they stopped him surprise has been the way they've used their fullback but they've always used the fullback down around the goal line champ Henson scored 20 touchdowns last year Lucilius score 13 this season now it's resting on the oneyard line second down a yard to go or an Ohio State touchdown that front is outstanding spur Kregel Myers back in Higgs they're good this will be the 18th play on this Drive there it is right there let's watch Archie Griffin lead him in here on our second rerun the tailback 45 blasting ahead and he takes out Parker and Johnson's over Ohio State takes the lead Conway for the extra point bash Nagle steps it down the kick is up and the kick is good Ohio State on punishing driving 80 yard mark kicking off Blair Conway Anthony Davis and Allan fighter Judy met at the 5yard line Carter away from you Smith the linebacker reserve linebacker playing on the specialty teams USC with the ball in play on their 23 were the first time it's really seven to three and the Trojans though occurs they cannot give the football Ohio State because they can move the ball so Pat Haden right now how'd you cut out for him he must establish some kind of an offense or they're gonna have problems all right Davison more behind Pat Haden the pitch top the Anthony Davis Ohio State to fixing him very well done far need Luke for the center last year I bought this converting from a center to a defensive cornerback a very unusual conversion number 46 Steve Luke from Massillon Ohio famous high school football for the past little I'll wear Paul Brown got his car curtain I've got to go back to that defense we don't want to be technical that's a rather simple thing but they're using virtually the same defense as you own us see it looks like a five that becomes a three for three man line for linebacker three for four Hey luckily setup okay Pat Haden slip and I think that destroyed his timing he threw a high ball that time he's usually very accurate just a natural passer 511 knocked all that as tall as you'd like him to be with a big onrushing lineman now watch how deeply he sets up that takes a strong arm to set up that deep the deepest man we saw set up an approach own aiming he steps up mate 10 yards like this junk he couldn't sing this little brat away Jim Fox hitting the knocking down first down us and there's the timeout that's the end of the first period for the score Ohio State seven us C 3 C with the ball under 38 they're trailing 7 to 3 they've just picked up a first down by Randy Gradishar and so far Davis has been unable to move nine Ohio State's run 22 plays in this game USC is run 16 this is so different that it's going to take all kinds in second hour for an Anthony Davis very much like Griffin fighting for every inch of the way Davis has made six yards and five carries second down nine Hayden on the deep drop out of the pocket he comes to the 4045 and he'll closing the potatoes picked up a first down watch him at the edge of this run out all right this was in a patented quarterback draw remember big cake with a middle linebacker dropping we said it's a different leave it comes up the middle the scramble number 10 watch this oh that's Neal cozy you cut him down first down USC now on the Ohio State 43 the leading rusher in the game Pat haiti's for us see the quarterback after that scramble second down ten he is not supposed to defended well against the past as told you but he looked mighty good on that one he sure did and again just to get back to a point which could be the pivotal point USC does not use Benford more that part's up the middle they have not as much as probably they could throw the big t Johnson how he runs well in this defense if you don't have a fullback that's coming straight at it your offensive threatening attack will not go and motion Davis just came in as they running a blanket reverse to replace Linds one against wanna Brina house they tap that one diagnosed just to the 40yard line of Ohio State a gain of three third and seven and Jim Pope who plays the short side of the boundary side he's from McKeesport Pennsylvania a unc's in a third and seventh they're trailing seven to three early in the second period thirteen minutes to play and a half down recruiting passwords to the outside in the pocket he has that open field ahead of him that's it right here big tangle he's dropping notice how that Center opens up okay either you got your back they've locked to the inside of the gusik the quarterback right here some keggle six one nice fake on Gradishar all right first down USC Oni Ohio State 29 number called a monster man who shot food an alien and now Anthony Davis may have yardage in this game leading ground gainer for USC is the quarterback Pat Haden 28 yards in to carry on the 35 yard line second down 16 for USC Davis off the field and rod McNeil comes in at tailback number 27 Harry Jerome has got to run straight at this one digs at the flanker wide left Hey look she's field over 30 to the 25 yard line by Jim cope with Ralphie left in position to cover rod McNeil 213 pounds of freshman sophomore about standing until an injury become much more an aggressive runner it's on the 27 they call it third and eight for USC USC has had five third down plays today and made three of them wellhow State has had three out of five third and eight twentyfive state am decree the allamerican in a war in Ohio they leave in the 25 all right the thing that's surprising me right now it's the Duke defense because I think it's a beautifully conceived Buckeye defense is the fact that you're going to get to the outside took me on the pass the screen the screen has not been used not sure is not going to be used in the field though coming up a we'll see it later 42 yard field goal attempt I love it hey Lou he broke the USC school record in this game if kick this up the old USPS for under 45 yards the Rose Bowl record is 48 Lima hey Lu just missed that one so the kibosh presents the college money crunch Thursday at 10:00 Eastern time right here on NBC Anthony Davis will kick off for USC back deep for Ohio State in the middle is Archie Griffin on the far side is Bradshaw and on the near side is Tim Holy Cross we have 11 minutes 12 seconds to go in the first half at 7 to 6 the Ohio State also in the eye of that wedge if it is developed will be the allamerican John Hicks number 74 that's right there he is he's done a 20 yard line why would you want him there what do you think about three people down at one time best linemen in America this year John Hicks this kick is coming to Davis in the 15 over the 35 and of the 36 Artie Griffith brought down by Ray Rodriquez house they don't put the ball in play now on your 36 yard line he likes to block that's what you pay offensive tackles for good afternoon never lost destroyed green the Griffen Griffen choice 44 where he ran into Richard would number 83 and Dale Mitchell will be a second down out two yards to go for Ohio State seventysix Ohio State leading ten and a half minutes to play in the first half and there's slat formation that's the tight end puggy coming in motion lead is a very clever fakir IDIA to pull back up the middle but then they're trying to tackle Cornelius green was number 85 till Mitchell the left linebacker for USC he thought Green had the ball first down Ohio State Ohio State on their 47 all right he continues to be a defensive tough defensive game for the middle of both of these defensive units identical as we've said several times you're going to attack it straight up the middle the fullback is vital if he gets off the ball if you can attack that center hole he'll go a long way found on the 49 if USD by Danny reach the left line back I'll be tough to get off the line of scrimmage when you're retired at number 18 poke each is a tight end and he got off beautifully almost beautifully looking the wrong way our team is partly an accidental block but they should block like that all the time that was a pass play go down a pas de then green turn it into a broken play second down six Ohio State on the USC 48 flags go down Archie Griffin over the 45 to the 40 free Kevin Bruce and the tackle a Bradshaw is in motion I'm not sure Curt whether John McCain started that deep set that Ohio State is now using when OJ Simpson was here but keeping him as far off the line of scrimmage as he does when that deep back gets the football he can read that hold very well the blocker hits up several strides ahead of him he looks at the defense wherever the hole is he goes motion Finley against Bradshaw Ohio State who's now in a wing back he goes out and bashed Nagle comes in don't believe what do you like that mistake second down ten total yards in this game USC has 105 Ohio State 98 and the score is about that close 7 to 6 well high o state 850 to go in a half in fact in the USB territory for the USD 48 where he stopped by Monty DARS the middle guard and Kevin Bruce who's now an air linebacker number 50 we'll have a third down coming Sims is coming back in and Anthony as linebackers for USC third down five to go Ohio State on the USC 48 yard line Green the Clipper on the 46 yard line of USC fourth and three and now coming in is an interesting story Mike Keith's number five is going to try the first punt of his varsity career Mike Keith let's see how he does but they need the regular punters out Ohio State does one thing beautifully a front of 39 times this year the opponents returned only 34 yards 39 planes' good cut and sitting on the 5 look out here they made up they can't get to it it's in for the touchback and it'll be us sees ball first down under 20 yardline Randy Gradishar down here trying to cover that punch slap it back into the field of play Trojans ball first down de joined us late here

over and another USC field goal of 42 yards and that's the story we have a timeout that has been strangely quiet here in the second 31st on USC under emotion and he's tackled by rich Parsons the Ohio State safety man and Tim Fox they're over all we may find out that Manfred gold Ford can run the football that's the opening that they're giving him number 44 was a block from the outside and trapped to blocking on the linebacker Banford or hit it very nice eight first downs for USC seven for Ohio State rod McNeil he'll going away from the flow of the play here's the pass to him 43 yard line by Tim Fox number 12 next time they lined up Everest number 12 Tim Fox unusual number on defense you know in college they could use any numbers you want on defense but look at the left tackle of Ohio State there he is 42 how's that for a number for the 50 tackle Arnie Jones number 42 left tackle agile tackle first down southern calendar 43 Billy now stays in front of his fan that's typical talking Andy Davis this thing breaks it to the other side around the booth now here's another angle kurt right Davis had an Achilles tendon injury automobile accident the great baseball player of fact may go

Woody Hayes my estate has been excellent today in converting third down plays five out of eight it also puts in that Big John's murder also as a tight end just to get as much flocking into that offense as possible all right the flocks will start building with a back third and a yard to go Ohio State sets down USC's ahead 14 to 7 Johnson Nagel was in front of him leading the way number 48 a freshman has scored two touchdowns of the road fall here it is again you know where we're coming we've said it before up for 33 and he's got a lot of years ahead of him what a backfield that's going to be or is a little high off a drove from their 30yard line they've had two drives now 80 and 70 yards Claire Conway for the point it is up it is deflected by Charles Phillips Charlie Phillips deflected it off to the left and Ohio State went up there and over after the deflection it still made it so it's a tie game 14 to 14 well please 70 yards for Ohio State I remind you that Saturday January 12 we'll have the 25th anniversary of the North South Senior Bowl one o'clock Eastern Time NBC Sports number one and live coverage of major sports that that's all your battle Ohio State will take that point for the existence of linebackers Charlie Phillips of USC clarified way ditch the low line drive that by Helen Carter on the five to the 2025 east of the 30yard line first down USC on

playing Lynn Swann deep so you might look for that other mantoman with a little bit less be to take it underneath dissolve 25 McKay second down 11 for the Trojans 33 yard line by Arnie Jones the left tackle of Ohio State block is moving now 20 seconds to go have a third down and seven again they run the ball around the field history 40 yard line he may have the first down rich middle didn't pick a goal tackling there and it is the first down so they stopped the clock 9 seconds remaining in the half I should wind the clock up the USC is unhappy with that way Trojans come off the bench they were standing right there there's a flag down Ethan was trying to get out of bounds to stop the clock and he was given a forceful push off I abandon tree number 88 and the Trojan fans are booing and approach offense they became irate decrees were playing very well he's 61 he's only 215 pounds he's played an earlier screen well paint on it played this point too well Hayden was just trying to waltz out of bounds leisurely and he winds up under the bench knew seconds to go Rockaway the hometown USB fan now the penalty a 15 yard goes against Ohio State puts the ball on the USB 49 Briscoe foul against Ohio State of the tree you know it's kind of hard to really explain the intensity or try to understand the intensity of a fire like decree coming in here so kept up for this football game made it I'm sure now he he regrets it whistle blows officials call for the time 10 raggle now is into the flanker wide will be the last play of the half Rob McNeil and he stopped and the croc shows time

score Ohio State 14 USC 14 as we get ready for the second half kickoff in the 1974 Rose Bowl game large difference in total offense fat hate has hit 11 out of 19 3 out of 5 for camellias green the leading rusher has been Anthony Davis 29 yards for USC and the top rusher in the game for Ohio State Archie Griffin was 64 I she was 11 of 18 but that other one pads was that playaction pass shall befall Anthony Davis through one fan the JK McKay for a touchdown and an errorfree game almost out one turnover that was against Ohio State through a pass interception neither team has fumbled and only two penalties on each day Ohio State 14 USC 14 as we get ready for the second half kickoff in the 1974 Rose Bowl game large difference in total offense Pat havens hit 11 out of 19 3 out of 5 for camellias green the leading rusher has been Anthony Davis 29 yards for USC and the top rusher in the game for Ohio State Archie Griffin was 64 back she was 11 of 18 but that other one has was that play action pass shall befall Andy Davis through onepass the JK McKay for a touchdown and an errorfree came almost out only one turnover that was against Ohio State through a pass interception neither team is bubbled and only two penalties in HD so they're both executing in high fashion as first half ohayo space going to receive and Lima Helu is ready to kick off instead of Anthony Davis back deep will be bash Nagel at the top of your screen Archie Griffin's in the middle at the bottom Horace Bradshaw in the Halos Quibbler and for more Patrick Moore we've been waiting for him he's right of the kicker he's also the full bag and they say he's great on special team : locks him in low and his he goes terrific man he's made about 50% of the USB tackles that kick off this here Cornelius green brings him up Archie Griffin Elia is the fullback and over the 25 after the 26 yard line Archie Griffith stopped by Jane Simms well the Griffin keeps rolling away did in the first half he'll have his 11th 100yard game section al you're right you know they keep hitting that slot they're running against with books like the 53 their one defensive tackle talked on him and cross on 52 this bread hazel right in front of the eyes to the right they give it all Lilia Lucilius a fullback I think that's full back up the middle our team is Parker the safety man on the 32 yard line they look at that fire sidelines and it's going to be third down and a short yard to go for Ohio State I'll tell you impress me the first half number 52 the center Steve Myers he's blocking oneonone on Monty darvis Doris and that's a big job and he had to be hold up and get here run for 236 pounds all right the linebacker had to do a big job he's going to get pushed down to play fashion ankle Legion Vox ovitch would you know once you break that tight defensive coverage this man could have gone all the way when we just had a broken play here for Ohio State illegal procedure the right tackle Hicks jump and that's a fiveyard penalty which puts the ball back on the 36 yard line of Southern Cal gives Ohio State up first and 15 and they move it back to the 37 it's a five and a half yard penalty 14 to 14 a tie game we just open the third period bruce healey is back in at fullback 36 the inside reverse Bryan fashion angle who takes the ball from the flanker spot and cuts inside number 48 Gary Jeter the freshman tackle from Cleveland Ohio whose step father and John hits his mother both worked in the same hospital John Hicks the right tackle is Jeter's Idol and he's playing opposite him today second down now ten to go fake green keeps the ball is passed a budget that died in a diving graphite bucket on the 14 yard line that's hugging make that one a fake the basket angle watch fast they will come across and when a man can run you better respect it back snake will move to the inside holds the linebacker Green fires beats the allamerican really Artemis Parker Huggins has been important last four out of six passes for Canadia stream and the first time neither team has lost the ball by other fumble what a fight been going on inside he's been talking about it there's the cough right there all right the Trojans first down under 16 they're tied 14 all 12 46 to go in the third quarter running this ride down on his 19 yard line he's it there I 71 be kissing the and really the difference in these two funding attacks right now is the fullback we know Hayden canal past the young man old orphan industry in his throwing wealth but it's the fullback we haven't really seen Banford more except for two carriers right deals that fail back he's 25 pounds heavier than Davis made on his 18 yard line by feet juicy now they're preventing him from stepping into the pocket and coming out of it they containing from getting outside now they stopped him from that's big yardage there's a look at us East third down plays so far four out of seven a high ratio Davis it back in at tailback Neel Cody Kurt is going to be playing Swann very tight they came the case watt on the same side what arguing he's going to lose the argument addy Gradishar tthey puts one inside very wisely deal coldly plate JK McKay Swan hits it inside he fires it unusual strides at Pat Hayden has but it was a perfect strike Lynn Swann Lynn Swann bodies forth faster the game he's the leader in the pack eight this year with 37 he's the alltime leader now and us the past receiving history aspirin for the fall back he came into this game tied with Roger Sherman 91 catches in a career they fought for today so he is the alltime past receiving the king of USC football giggle at Middleton on that last battle falls on the 38 yard line of USC of second down seven the game is tied 14 off 10:35 to go in the third period that's right yet Kurt we're waiting for the quick first fight of fall back that's where the bubble is straight up motion is davis by the senior from San Fernando California was used most of the time as a blocker Randy granted our allamerican laughs after fighting down I picked a goal ball now is on the 46 yard line of USC Trojan first down one of the things McKay's said that Sam Cunningham's leaving was a big loss well they haven't used Banford board I'll tell you he looks like he can run and run well 18 first downs for USC Rawdon motion Oh girly crap top I fit Kegel right in his arms a bullet passed and he had a wide open field on that far sideline he was a middle linebacker number 78 is Steve Riley number 71 is Pete Cusick you keep your feet when you're blocking the tackle tries to make a roll perfect position at school book type blocking second down 10 Yu Shi McKay diagramming a play in his mind it puts one in motion again 20 well they know where the focal is here it is again perfect call you set up to the outside you have a full bag lead draw Anthony Davis now has 46 yards on the ground and the Trojans have their 19th first down the 13th Ohio State a game is tied 1414 9:20 to play in the third period ideal the tailback 1811 out of pull back to the 33yard line that starts out of the roll out roll out right and he slips it off to his fullback to draw plays in a row for USC one to the tailback one of the fullback and Davis checks back into the huddle replacing McNeill second down four to go USC on Ohio State's 33 most wanna McKay are in a slot left Letty's too much for that Swan had a Stefan Kegel at Middleton now that there was a coach's dream to get a police receiver into big linebackers covering but that was a passive just a little too far ahead of Lynn Swann we've been pointing out how the middle of the defense has been playing big Kegel is number 62 playing some right off the line of scrimmage Artie Jones 42 places to the outside he Cusick also for the outside big cable either come where he drops back look for it there like nails the tailback far ahead of him maybe the 28th rich parson was the safety man rather star the lion bathroom 53 on that tackle and again us he has a first down number 24 us B once again other than the passing attack Hayden just a different type faster than green they're mirroring each other both defensively and the running attack 1414 avoided and it is rather and you can see why kenkun replaces Gradishar that open field linebacker Juan in motion the pitch to Davis tackle by Fox that saves a touchdown flex deblocking now especially by 44 that's what made it work he hit Steve Luke breaks it to the outside and the fancy stepping boy he's got those quick feet watching tightrope walk the sideline this takes quick feet look at him on his toes dancing down that sideline at Fox drove him out first down goal to go Gradishar back in Neil the tailback he has the ball and bounce for the oneyard line crawling on the ball as head for poor number 44 he was hit so hard watch the ball pop up Darrell I see this again now was almost the identical play the one you saw a moment ago Middleton is moving over Patrick Moore is leading here's the wall it really talks off that Parsons that hit him we'll have it out of our picture Vasiliy I don't want to play a went through seven yards second down should it go for a touchdown and Felipe was trying to die for it he stopped in the oneyard line third and a yard to go where a USC touchdown that could put them out in front in a 1414 tie just under seven minutes to play in the third quarter and he remember last year slam bam cunningham used to fake that same kind of died four times he dives over last year most valuable player of the game Novak a 1919 the player of the game award went to George Halas for the Great Lakes team rot left up in the air let's get some different angles on this up in the air goes the little van and hidden pretty well in there they got it in just about here's another angle 32:46 city now on the ground on the ground now they're really going to cop Steve Copsey pretty good but he got Tim Ryan Ted Lindsay Lambeth probably action riding at 8:30 Eastern Time and it's a short kick lift up there on the 30yard line to the 33 yard line and it was picked up there by number 77 whose alignment any of Doug France they profile a bit rare chance to look the ball that last drive by USC was a beauty there it is that's the dopefather 14 plays 624 86 yards 84 yards and Davis took it over Alice the whole house they'd come back I gave the ball to Archie Griffin and Griffin gets straight ahead to his party or he can really find that opening inside I saw a flag go down when he started to the line of scrimmage they've had very few penalties to penalties on each team in the first half and that's going against Ohio State that's holy 15 yards interestingly enough second leading rusher on the team for new history and has not done much of that at all that is running and he can't run he is not trying to exploit the outside because of the speed of the USC linebackers principally first down 22 yards to go beat Johnson's back in a fullback 3025 and he stops in these 37 dead Roberts at number 47 and Dale Mitchell teamed up with the stopping 28 come on let's go let's get a drive going over on oh yeah sure they're going to mark one off and this is 15 yards against USC a first allow Hank after the 16 yard run by Cornelius Greene didja replanted and Pete Johnson leading in he's in there at fullback good thing that's good late hit on the sidelines first a foul though with Pete Johnson in there he has really impressed a fullback they're playing a little tighter sometimes they get Archie Griffin deep sometimes tight Griffin is to the 43 yard line tackled by Richard wood Wiley untangle we're going to pause briefly for a station identification this is the NBC television network CTV for in Columbus Ohio Archie Griffin by the way has now gained the most yards anything a single season for a big dent Blair green again and what if they hug each is having daddy grease will come over and then you leave yes playing nine gold out helps the glutes these pocket fires on the move perfect pass out that's your one beautiful first and goal to go straight on the USD for us via ahead 2114 the old straight P they're going here's a groundlevel shut you see a hole that is a hole how Kurt you could have carried that in my place so I might have been able to let's take a look at again what blocking he's running behind John Hicks and he just waltzes in bash nigga will spotted for Blair Conway and that kick and USB keeps the league USD 20 would ohio state 20 Davis was calling for it on the front of the 20 and he's down Steve Luke is down here fruits rule the attendance today 105,000 267 weekend at January 19th to 20th and DC will present on Saturday round three of the Dean Martin Tucson open the AFC NFC Pro Bowl game Arrowhead

California State Guard line with the first time flags go down how they cope radevich move that time that's it he moved the legal procedure go back to the Trojans 23 first and 15 that last drive three play 79 yards for Ohio State and the pass has been an important weapon today for Ohio State puckish has fought for patches for 89 yards he caught five all season he's got four in one game he's been a leading passer secret all year with only five catches make fun of me she is now in her left tackle over 75 on the 26 yard line of USP they have a second as well McNeal checks in at tailback Cornelius green has completed five out of seven today for a hundred and four yards he has completed only 36% of his patties back to the fray hey this is what happened turn around lift with the ball third down 12 USC on their 26 they're leading 21 to 20 and on that play they had rod McNeil wide open to that side ROG McNeil when I looks like Anthony Davis has come back and it may repeat I really she didn't throw the Anthony Davis now he has a thirst big tailback in Allen Carter number 21 passing play and I've lady ran across the line of scrimmage I think Pat he crossed the line of scrimmage when he threw the ball just I saw you saw a flag go down that's it and illegal forward fast again the zone drop he's trying to capitalize on it beautiful disciplined zone the short zone deep zone that's the past but he was definitely beyond the line of scrimmage alright there's an illegal forward pass loss of the down of federally a 5yard Jim lupus report now and Neil palsy is deep here's a kid this average 17 yards of punt return the best punt returner in the history of Ohio State his fourth touchdown here interception there's the sheen he'll call zposition the great country Turner actually cut he'll think that play because he forced it back to the inside oh well they take a breather after that's 57yard lucky again is Pete Johnson the fullback two freshmen having a day that a freshman with dream about for what how many questions there we get to playing a Rose Bowl number two how many score three touchdowns in a Rose Bowl game and he is now carried the ball with a 16time 482 yard second down four to go over in Ohio State touchdown and Johnson this time look at the power of that ship he was hit at the line of scrimmage I told you carried three Michigan players over five yards away and that time he blasted forward to about the yards a halflife watch his power al Jim gable blocking in front of him Curt Schumacher blocking there and here's the power rich wood makes what looks like a perfect tackle and yet he fights on down the yard to have to go for an Ohio State touchdown they could put them out in front really girls Anthony number 55 Betty 5 and down at the bottom of that file number 79 two freshmen Gary Jeter watch it again there it is again and he is popped most points scored in the Rose Bowl game we did it last year he doesn't get in Sam Cunningham did it with 24 and he's closed Pete Johnson an ohio state has called a timeout they have fourth down and a yard to go for a touchdown they're trailing 2120 cumber 55 is Charles Anthony of us V over on the sidelines talking to is defensive Gus here's the Ohio State fans and their staff all right we saw one of the biggest holes I have ever seen on a goldmine or on any line the last touchdown Pete Johnson made he ran at his allamerican tackle he's trying just about every hole they're continuing to pop their big gun in there there's 40 Hayes talking his people Cornelius means back in that hole was to the right side before I wonder if they'll come back there fourth down and a yard to go everybody in the Rose Bowl now coming up on her feet under than 5,000 here today they want to see this goal line play I'm not going to say this is a play of the game because every time one team scores the other Club comes right back and puts on a magnificent March this is going to be one of the big words read Cornelius read the software's over at Ohio State goes back to the lead looks like typical play they thought it was going to go to this man what a fake beautiful Cornelius there that whole Al your way let's see it again watch this fake this is real faking look at him slip with it and take it out of the belly of beat Johnson have scamper over for the score how about from the ground on the ground here you're watching three sophomores and a freshman right now and at Ohio State backfield now what will they do Haley 26 21 and they're going to go for two I like this twopoint play Ruth and I'll bring them back five yards now change the strategy let's push the ball on the eight yard line and Blair Conway comes in Olli will be fashion Agel another flag goes down that's offside against USC outside against USC Legolas is offside now they're calling the captain over Ohio State and they want to talk to their coaches they hold up all right the offside penalty is declined they take the extra point on the successful conversion kick though it's Ohio State 27 USC 21 two minutes 12 seconds to go in the third period time to cover the kickoff I keep thinking 43 points all year USC has 21 already against the super defensive team playing a different type defense today but just executing perfectly rest of these offensive figures I'll give them to you in just a moment Davis at tailback more fullback 5/8 puts one in motion Aidan slip the ball 26 yard line where Jim poked the right in Gradishar are in on the play second down three to go USC under 26 the deal back at is tailback us see today as 306 yards total offense Ohio State has 316 yards both teams are over 300 yards in total offense approaches 8 to the 29 yard line and the free number 88 the end made the stop for Ohio State and they're going to measure now in there and left defensive tackle coming at Nick Bonamici he's in there briefly for 42 Arnold Jones Hilda rerun was picturing Lynn Swann a flanker back that's against Fox very a lot of interesting things happen interesting yeah well the great wrestling matches of the century a great foot hope I think against Tim five bucks in the house third down and a foot to go the quarterback sneak by patty she has a first down USC's ball along their 30yard line the score is 2721 Ohio State one minute to play in the third quarter McNeal back in his tailback I really the one big thing we haven't seen is the blistering speed of Lynn Swann deep they're playing in deep they're playing him very cautious but he can fly Neal's going in motion is very rarely see a call for it Tesla drowning unless he just spikes the ball almost at his feet but there's no one in the area where he throws the ball it's intensely proudly but there were a couple of red shirted guys over that way fan decree was in there after him chasing him there the first downs but it's on a scoreboard of counts at Ohio State as a 27 21 leave us seas fall under 30 yardline second and 10 Davis again the tailback kenkun as tremendous middle linebacker replacing Kegel for Ohio State before coming out of the back passes during the regular season now on the far side they booed a moment ago van decree but he's playing that spot extremely well as I mentioned earlier not too big 6 1 to 15 have a difficult time getting down to that side it can be very difficult to try to screen against it all right we have a third down at five Ohio State fans will have the tree next year there's the end of the third period and what a rose ball we're having here I'm a fan Kurt Goudy and El tiro got it USC's ball third and 535 Aiden stop okay he catches the ball at a 38 he's short of the first down somebody asked him how it felt to play for the hurt his knee other I felt the play for his father the coach if my father doesn't coach the player as he coaches the coaches they came Akane was hurt when he came down hit up in the air and now you're going to have an anxious father over in a sideline not just with Claire but his son is injured john mccain's the kind of end though Curt as we both know that everyone on that field treated like his son that's a funny situation Jim Lucas the front and Neal calls in fact he ran one back 57 yards the last time to set up that goahead touchdown for Ohio stay here the little kick right at him basket for a return rosie has covered this time and he's tough that he's 36 yardline us he got away with that line drive but late ball carrier in this game for Ohio State's their freshman Pete Johnson 86 yards Archie Griffin has 71 Anthony Davis has 69 yards for USC and now you're playing Woody Hayes it's football game he's ahead of you it'll like to grind it out he wants to eat up the clock yeah that thick freshman Eric Johnson ripping the tailback Cornelius Green waiting for the snap 40 43 yard line he can really stay on his feet yes how the left linebacker body down after about four shots at it well that's not what he hates is kind of football very looks like you can heat up the clock first down he's going too fast it's happened to coach Hayes that cloud of dust isn't here today well as he says he's mellowed he's been all sweetness and light out here for the last ten days but his history folks second down to the gods to the fullback just made it to the line of scrimmage and that's all art Riley at Monty door spending there Riley the right tackle number 70 third and two now for Ohio State on our 43 yard line passing has been important for Ohio State they've been kidding the ohio state passing attack but they did five out of seven set up two of their touchdowns today early in the fourth period stir it into short of the first down at Powell Charles Anthony Anthony's been outstanding today number 55 being here at heart Riley number 70 I hear the punting team on the Ohio State friendly wolf defense's factor stiff enough here's the kid that made his first Affairs that a varsity game in the first half of one foot he's replaced the star front of Ohio State but any who fractured his ankle so here's his second fun of his varsity career and it's not a bad fun coming here 41 yard line after the table that's down that is 28 and while he find out your red fire is definitely star s Sanford and Son starting Friday at 8 o'clock Eastern Time Hayden throwing oh good JK McHale is alright oh dear he's back in the game he has caught four passes today Lynn Swann has got four buggy just caught form for Ohio State for 90 yards all right second down 10 USC on their 28 that certainly pulled off that's the starting to sort of flame out al that's right Kurt the strategies a little different right now history flashy or less just locking up front that's a murderous offensive line they have that's what holds out of this pool and you wouldn't believe these Johnson scored three touchdowns Elia one now they're going for two green keeps the ball number 84 for Ohio State is Robert Sinskey muchmaligned tastic attack of Ohio State has been the story of this game they have thrown just enough to open up USC and make the run more effective Cornelius Green has attempted eight passes that hit six of them and some of them have been big one 20 30 at 40 yard passes which really made us think on defense first down USC under 22 now hate flipping as he fessed up overthrown fake David a fourtime heythis lifted to set up that's right now highest state really has the Trojans where they want they wanted to throw the football they will not use too much time doing it Ohio State knows they can move the football but if the hate is gonna throw well Kurt he's gonna have to again try the short areas over the middle they're taking away the outside this defense by the way has just worked beautiful second you have seen how trailing by 14 points out of the pocket by the pressure throws on the run great laughs I what a pass by Pat hey for a righthander to run left and then as you're running left jump and throw that takes cow as a first down we have a player issue for Ohio State Neal Cole's he's coming out watch a righthander go left very difficult fast right now it sure is he's got that boys that we've seen frequently that makes for a great quarterback constantly watching that secondary throwing on the ball pick it up there neat job Southern Californians to go on the Rose Bowl game that's palsy who was it returned to putt 57 a big play of this game hit at the 44 southern cow by Jim Fox who's been a stick out on defense today for Ohio State number 12 and he's down that was Fox's tenth tackle that was a big one he made a big tackle there because Davis had a hopeful head of steam up there was a good block by manfred board Davis cut back and going fulltilt hits him Fox Anthony Davis has 74 yards on the ground the top ground Gator Archie Griffin with 97 he was shaken up taken out he hasn't been back in the freshman Pete Johnson has 86 yards for the Buckeyes and three touchdowns today a freshman with three Rose Bowls that's down throws the swing Davis has a first down after the juggling catch and he'll pull these over there to drive him out number 20 at the USC first down and now the tempo is picking up you see a difference you see the way these men are coming off the ball Anthony Davis who is not court well flew out of that backfield the tempo is fixed up they know they've just about got the score here put the ball up 49 times today and hit 15 is seasonal percentage 56 percent of the classes attempted were completed Neal in motion and before to the 45 of Ohio State you know as hard as they're hitting out fired up as both teams were it's remarkable to flame with so few mistakes it's an extremely well played hard forth very clean football game that little incident with the creating really was just a matter of the fan being so high but other than that beautifully coach representing two great states very well nine minutes to go in the Rose Bowl 35 21 Ohio State 18 on second down swings at the Davis complete stay tuned right after this game will switch to the Orange Bowl in Miami Penn State and LSU and John cappelletti the Heisman Trophy but before that game we haven't heard much really two tight end on the opposition has done well but it's been over at a bitch really you've done so well for us see the tide in Payton has not used him that much today Neal back in at tailback who is now the middle linebacker replacing Cagle third and seven the USC 40 short of the first down he's tops on the 39 of Ohio State and he's hit there see they look for that sideline has to go for fourth in the yard and trailing by 14 fourth down and a long yard to go McNeil is in the football game is he very deep secondary to the yard he's going to pass for us those teams are going right at the heart the strength of it that is the fetish or being blocked all over the top total yards in this game now Ohio State 378 USC 362 and the score 35 21 Ohio State Southern Cal in the Ohio State 29 yard line for the first down 25 foes he made the tackle and the heat was put in there by Ken Kuhn who was blitzing from the middle linebacker position number 54 the 4 yard gain second down six for USC will try to get a look at Jim o bratatat East number 89 we're trying to figure out why is it that Payton has not been going to him it could be the man the linebacker forcing a big shot second down six Anthony Davis okay number 32 Rick Middleton underneath on top Jim Koch the right in third and six USC behind 35:21 I'm moving against them there's our third down situation seven minutes to play john mccain knows if they have to keep this drive going the potion McNeil Aiden with a rush blowing him dead of the 4tr by fans degree of Randy Gradishar but it was decreed the foot on him and they really went after him they were blitzing on display for they were and they were coming hard against a good offensive on a big play heard there were a lot of arguments about who represents the big 10 I know what he hayes was under a great deal of pressure but we have to say this team has done just a beautiful job there is decree there's bad decree putting him pounded fat hates read it dump it off and a timeout if they call by USC this is a fourth at 21 coming Pat Haden lots of conference with his Co 620 to go in the game and NBC tells you the score is Ohio State 35 USC 21 over will swish to Miami LSU against Penn State of New York for now here is a 21 yards they need and he unloads it deep I think slightly deflected it he was down there around at Jenner 15 yard line that have held a first down how about that for a sophomore he's played 11 games this year and every game he's gained at least 100 yards two more years to go bad news bad news future opponents of Ohio State so he's getting better all the time and he'll get bigger and stronger on second and 5/8 Johnson a freshman more bad news for the future Ohio State opponent and he has three more years ago that's big fan dude I'll tell you he's something well they sure he gives it defeat Johnson he's into USC territory to the USC 47 were Charlie Phillips brought him down I still hang my hat on that passing of Cornelius green today as a key for Ohio State all right sure was you know you're talking about the fullback and so was I not only feat Johnson Vidia and in the wings a man that the drought will rank fifth alltime scorer champ Henson who was not gonna cut into the game had a knee operation in September he is dressed he can play but probably will not rock moving at Ohio State's favor for forty five to go he may make this alright that Richwood fired across here's the first angle again another super block by the big bull behind him and it and they're just just fools let's kick taken by Ellen Carter for the 36 Ohio State want to revenge today for the shellacking they received last year by USC and also they told you they're trying to stop that lost streak that the victims had against the pack a Jerome Davis made that tackle Ohio State is food for 438 yards in this game the alltime record Iowa's 516 guard a fog that's the first time USP on the Ohio State 44 L force there was a speed dial with the back at 59 made 516 yards an alltime low slow record today Ohio State as 438 yard well they've proven so much to us USC losing 1 tying a tremendous Oklahoma team 77 and being taken apart now hey dumps it off expert car for stop then I don't know me you know Notre Dame putting a spectacular game last night Alabama I imagine a lot of book I'd like to see your house they play anyone I wouldn't mind seeing who is they play anyone I'll tell you course the governor of Oklahoma has been here for the Rose Bowl his team couldn't go anywhere that sure he decided to come to the Rose Bowl governor Hall Kim great is now the fullback and this is a broken play ages diving ahead I don't believe he had to fall securely when he took the snap timeout call by USC man decree boy he come to play football today and he has been a big factor we said earlier they threw a different defense at him he's quick beats two blocks there he's been pretty yesterday on defense not too popular with USC fans but Ohio State will taking that play loss back to the 45 a second down now at 22 yards to go 45 or 4221 Ohio State they've rolled in the fourth period setting up the screen tomorrow for rock down on the 45k goal number 62 the middle linebacker the Ohio State female puts the quicker team speeds in last year they all move well lateral that's right you were talking about some of the factors and no we asked coach John Mackay about this team before the game and one of the things he brought up was this defense their ability to move and they are exactly that much quicker and I think die McKay he's in a fire Woody Hayes they think today's an innovator see the left hand moved here for a charlatan but I think you're going to feel benefits food I saw a flag go down the front a vicious poison caught my eye I'm sure this is going to be crawl back he jumped the gun watch it here watch it there he goes that's him he beat the snap and he wipes out a touchdown for us be Denis finition and Joe Costanza have been our age here in the booth today thank you very much gentlemen and our good friend dr. pine woods he's seen a lot of physicians in the Los Angeles area mr. sports dr. Fife woods he just does it for the love of it Zain Randy is our production stage manager Payton unloads it deeply well cover though incomplete bet for Lynn Swann a fairly effective with final Lynn Swann today oh yes they have that deep zone we've seen it all year it's hard to throw deep against it right now he's forced to throw deep against it you're just not going to beat it you've got to come short and so Ohio State's is okay that's what we'll give you but he's not taking it you had a senior there Lynn Swann covered by two fresh but Bruce rule at Jerome Davis s1 undoubtedly will go the number went around to the throw fix he has everything to look forward to wide receiver fleet of foot the hands the jumping ability the athletic competitiveness here the fourth down play 80 down the middle hit a cave a cage and it's the first down for USC Jay Kay McKie fleet and lost a fall I think Joe dick spot the ball he had control and last of all Randy Gradishar hopped on he beat another sophomore has been voted the player of the game last year with Sam Cunningham Sam the ban for us see first I know how stay under five they give it to Bruce you do the fullback and he wants to go back to linebacker I think the theme there next year but beat Johnson coming up behind you the freshman who ramble today for three touchdowns of 94 yards Steve Johnson he's just starting to learn what it's all about Ohio State has it wrapped up 42 21 40 seconds to go Paris Elia again it is brought down by jeanmarc area we hope you've enjoyed the game today I was going right down to a tight one till the middle of fourth quarter when Ohio State broke it open that's the time remaining Elia carries for a first down they're just eating it away a happy fan of the house they pass their team has the revenge that they wanted they stopped the gate winning streams a big change there will be the winner today four seconds to go and the muchdiscussed selection of Ohio State to come out here when our state has come through for the Big Ten athletic directors today that's right and they think about you think about last year and that overwhelming to speak 42 42 the 21 and saw first County at LD row gotta bet you goodbye a very happy new year",

one of the youngest of them all is number seven their quarterback the freshman Rick leads from Flint Michigan if you play it for the world Breen you better be able to run and look at Rick leach run Michigan doesn't pass often but Michigan can pass look at Rick Lee Edie number 37 Jim Smith for this cuts down the Wolverines counter on m2 on 40 now that's a big depression comes early 1,400 yards and that's from the conference and also has Archie Griffin the Heisman Trophy winner another thousand yard rusher robbed title last year a tailback this year a fullback great speed not great size but a great fullback for Michigan and what do you think of Michigan you think of defense number 35 is there wolf net all in Arkansas do that at Michigan's head coach Bo Schembechler you're right that's

Brodie the national championship can be decided right here in a few moments tonight well there's no doubt about that Jim and I think both offenses although they are a little bit different do require the same abilities out of their quarterback both Steve Davis and wrinkle each have to be able to run the ball they have to make the right decisions at the right time now their running backs even though Joe Washington is looked upon as one of the outstanding running back to come down the pike in quite a while he hasn't gained as many yards as the other side both Rob Lyle and Gordon Bell have outgained it just it's the detail and the structure of the whole offense but you're going to see an awful lot of Gordon Bell tonight and Rick Lee and is going to be a big big game and whenever you're on an orange ball it means pageantry our pregame pageantry is about to take place so let's go down to the field and see your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free the wretched

from him after Oklahoma and Michigan anxious to get out on the field John bode and play for this national championship here come the Wolverines of Michigan I said it something to him about this dis orange ball they seemed to get a good one every year we've got another one these guys are so pumped up now I've seen this reaction takes two or three different turns Michigan's been ready all week they've been practicing very hard for simplex and says the purpose is to give them all of a nice time I think he thinks a good time there's a whole lot of players would call a lot of hitting because that's what they've been doing in preparation on across the bill the big red of Oklahoma making their first appearance on television in more than two years a Michigan staff with both chemically coming off Barry Switzer heads to group across the field a packed house at the yard Bowl here in Miami and now as we said we're going to take that trip down memory lane and let's cut it off in the 1933

his arm earlier in the season he is a cocaptain and he is out there Michigan huddling on this side Oklahoma crossed away Ohio State was beat this afternoon and the remains the play and I'm sure that the Boomer Sooners figure that if they win they will be voted the national champion I'm sure they do Jim as I mentioned earlier it can take two or three different twists we're looking at very twist through he's got a smile I don't know if that's the indication of his feeling about this the game that was just over Bo Schembechler I know it just as interest in the outcome but what I did mention is that he can take two or three different turns when you already know going into a ballgame but you have a chance to get in and be a national champion if you put your attention on the ballgame everything goes fine if you put your attention on the importance of what it means to win the ballgame all kinds of things can happen I think we'll get a pretty good look at in just a minute all right Tony Diaz they calling out in Oklahoma Lam Tony D Renzo who came from San Paulo Brazil Ardmore Oklahoma to senior year in high school as an exchange student but kick it off and the D plan for Michigan will be number five Gordon Bell who during his career in 1975 carried the ball for 1,300 and 85 yards to lead the Big Ten and Bell has been averaging about 26 yards per kick off return his numbers 5 he is in the middle they'll try to get the ball to him everybody's on their feet at the 1976 Orange Bowl game is underway Gordon Bell in the end zona will down it there come out to the 20 yard line first down and ten ring cleats number seven will be the quarterback forty build and revive the tailback Rob title number 41 the fullback his foot and team Johnson 27 your wing back Jim Smith 37 dirt I

Phillips number 89 Mike Phillips needed on and then those Salman brothers Leroy 93 the often Trophy winner doing 91 the nose guard Anthony Bryant 71 Jimbo Elrod another allamerican and right em free allamericans in that front five Jamie Thomas 38 build all key 40 are your linebackers Sidney brown 21 Jerry Anderson 17 your corner Scott Hill 7 9 10 person 1 the safety second down nine this time in a Jim Smith it has the first down riding up to the foot 5 yard line where handles it makes the stop gifted little misdirection play they've got to do it early because Oklahoma's pursuit is so great give it to Jimmy Smith who many consider to be their best athlete little fake on us looks like it's going to be a continuation of an option however he has dismissed myth finds a hole got good blocking that's big way to start so early M Smith of Blue Island Illinois number 37 first down from a 35 as Italy hitting back the bell an excellent coverage by Mike Phillips and Jamie Thomas numbers 89 and 38 just shut them down that time come on the short side they look for somebody to break down somewhere defensively they didn't get in that time Gordon Bell had nothing to do but run out of Bounce time he got Paul also BR his second and 11 from a 34 for those of you who may not have heard it number one ranked Ohio State defeated by UCLA in the Rose Bowl just concluded 23 to death and the national championship is up for grabs here tonight Rick leach they stole the ball intercepted by number seven spot Hill my first vote over the ball game and Oklahoma will have the ball at midfield but all year long that's the way it's been going Jimmy both groups have been a little suspect in the air I expected maybe that fumbles were the only things we see put up there however Rick make the fake on a handoff get the way does a fine job actually had fits in between the hole out there grow under throw that Scott Hill picked it up now the Okies half ball Steve Davis number five and quarter Joe Washington 24 Jim withdrawal 42,000 feet knock boy in that wishbone second man through is Jim luttrell the fullback Victor Hicks 80 check that that was Joe Washington number 84 tinker Owens number 11 to split at Carl bonus water 67 they call him the USS law Mike Vaughn 17 either tackles Evans and Webb the guards wins an allamerican at Buchanan at center second now Davis keeps the football and David gets inside the 45 yard line down to about the 40 ball making the stop angelic number 81 at left and yep Honaker 97 Kim Davis the good middle guard 56 all Morton 77 the right tackle Mike Holmes 40 the right end Domino deal 96 one linebacker Dave Devin's 55 another Wolfman is gone to vector 4:35 I'll give you the deep minimum oh they're down George cottage Washington hip does not have to first down it'll be fourth down at the 43 hit by Jim pick up number 18 white Hicks number 17 and Jim Boulden 22 not that Michigan back view fourth down and about three and a half well 25 to go we are just starting the ballgame we're in the first quarter there's no score and now the kicking unit comes on if this has been one of the problems of Oklahoma in its kicking game Niger Owens forced to punt this year and as has several blocked well they haven't they haven't had to punt very often see I can understand why they don't work on it too hard all ends under no pressure there but gets the ball back to Dwight hates of the ball goes into the end zone and will come out to the 20 yard line first down and death though there's been a turnover but there's been no score 11:57 to go first quarter early on in the 1976 Orange Bowl Oklahoma nothing Michigan nothing I think the highlight of the game decide the Alabama waiting for me with telling President Kennedy understand everyone was excited about as we were all honored the president carry so offense and defense remain the same first off Michigan from their own 20 yard line as eat Johnson comes wide to the right the H is drawn once tonight it has been intercepted that's Jim Smith emotion right in the football they have nothing on Julia's self and Jimbo Elrod and Bill donkey down at the bottom I like Bob Hope's lot about the old American brothers do at Lee Roy Selmon when introduced him he said Dewey hit submit Leroy calls an executor Specter second down nine before off as that one first down tonight there's doing some there from you follow and their older brother Lucius played with him a couple of years ago they had three silver brother is now out of here like and down and me going to the air again putting it out of here and over the head of Dean Thompson let's play dad it'll be third down and nine the 21 well my compatriot John Brodie said if you see the ball in the air Thursday night it will be a fumble Bates has already thrown twice well you can see what makes it tough he knows it's tough to run the ball against Oklahoma's Jesus when you have three three allamerican football players playing that line it just makes it tough now now Sierra's got an awful tough job with doing Selman the man right over his nose here being the center you're going to see Lee Roy Selmon in the backfield but putting that pressure makes it tough on a quarterback they throw it on third down nine no a Salman and Leroy so Leroy Yaman won't be with her hey let's just take a look now I asked both Schembechler earlier if really it's through the ball very much that hey he had to learn to be the type of order back that we use there he was dropped back quarterback in high school he's great athlete he used to throw the ball 30 35 times the game looks right now like he's trying to walk simple Elrod also putting on the pressure to get the ball away their kids called for by number one sack Henderson up the 49 yard line so hopeful that's the football again 1037 ago who is still in the first quarter there's no score I'll never forget that our goal game or in that game I believe I made my greatest element on a football field that with a 27 yard touchdown catch late in the game that gave on Navy team a chance to beat Missouri and a red shirt there without a numbers Lucius saw in the other Selma graduated a couple of years back and a lot of people have asked to ask me what are they what is mom beat him I don't know what she feeds them but I'd like to know how she raised him because she's been there that's mobile number 77 costings Dean David's back to the 43 yard line that will be second down at about 16 to go looks like another one of those ball games Jim where the deep men's walks often that make sure you hold them off it though they Brooks's it now and the wide receiver number 82 goes to the top of the screen Oklahoma hasn't grown yet Davis hands off to Latrell the bullseye gets across the 45 yard line about the 46 getting up off the pile again is mo Morton that's right knocking Oklahoma is awesome in the almonds of line they're listed weights at the tackles 262 and 282 at the guards to 65 and 247 and at Center 230 third down and 13 Davis back for his first pass you can get it away a danger corner down he goes cut from behind and there's that man again mo Morton number 77 and on Oklahoma will have to kick it away I don't think Oklahoma's been in third down and 14 all year long they probably don't have a play for Barney valve is not going deep and said it will be number 17 white Hicks on all joining in fact there's Jim Smith as on the 30s Dan sticker Owen oh it's lines this one use the bar and they're not going to touch that and Oklahoma's going to get an excellent cut out of that inside the 10 down to about the stick guard line rolling dead at the five and just good goes to let it go by so many guys down here they're right it was the bigger there was a president this fall a 42nd annual Orange Bowl with the University of Michigan making its first appearance of any Bowl other than the Rose Bowl and Oklahoma has been here before they haven't been anywhere seen on television in the last couple of years because information and our four teams ready you bet they are now Oklahoma with its great defense the bottles Allman Brothers will try to bottle up the Wolverine right not a couple of yards up seven yard line Jimbo Elrod down at the bottom there Jimbo he'll Roth allamerican number 54 Dewey Sulman number 91 allamerican Lee Roy Selmon 93 allamerican at the Outland Trophy winner now Pete Johnson comes printing onto the field and Jim Smith is coming out it'll be second down at eight from the seven yard line Johnson goes very wide left that's what he fell and he jumped up next to the line of scrimmage right there's Lee Roy Selmon and if you haven't heard enough about the Salomon Brothers it is said by pro scouts that have watched all of the films that Leroy has been knocked off his feet twice in his entire career we're getting a chance to look at it here Jim the guys got such great movement both laterally and forward he's in outstanding strength each type of man you start a defense with it in professional football and an expansion club couldn't find a better guy that time he just made a play that's how many people can make the Imps pencils in the tight end team Johnson comes out the middle goes lightly and Lydell gets across the 15 yard line and that's enough for the first down in the old paper stock if it gets a little bit out of their hole you know that's a big one because that all you have to do Sears been working real hard he knows he has to get a piece of doing something for them to do anything up the middle that time he holds his ground with him gets a little movement on him do he can't react in time and that's why I bought the first down couldn't come at a better time for Michigan Ian Johnson comes up Sparky 82 gene Johnson 88 tied answer in there Gordy Bell goes down at the 30 yard line hey Roy so number 93 and his brother Dooley right there the flag went down downfield Pistol Pete Williams and it may be holding but we'll wait for his announcement holding is what it is alright I got number 80 white theme for holding it's going to be second down where the ball is or it's going to be first down with a half the distance of the gold it's going to be first down in about the seventeen Dewey is making the decision and I didn't hear what he said he wants that distance back to the goal it makes good sense why I mean fishing is not some type of football team that there I've got a whole hang of their own I guess the right in on the right team if we got it again anyway they're not the type of team that has wants to throw the ball particularly in the position they're in right now and the Oklahoma wants every opportunity to keep them down there again Jim Smith comes up 27 feet Johnson replaces him first down and 1940 Val fights his way across the 10 yard line for pickup about four and it'll be second down and 50 to go bill donkey and Scott he'll get on the stop forty now thirteen hundred and thirty five yards that let the victim this year Mary's Wofford and a lunch the other day was saying the two best running backs in football are on this field his own George Barca your Washington and Gordie Bella Michigan others may argue but that's what Coach Switzer said libel across the 15 of the 17 yard line where Sidney Brown and Jamie Thomas made the tackle take a look at the other filmin brother Leroy he gets shot well it's tough to move him very far and they had a very nice successful play now they're all the way up to 39 they are always solvent on his brother Dewey from Eufaula Oklahoma not only can they play football but they are excellent students at all third down and nine leach keeps the ball himself hugs up deal it's got the first down a more Rick Lee has the first down across the 30yard line knocked out about five Brown and Henderson sounds pop the football at the 33 at Michigan again gets out of the hole legit when you make a play like that you've got to have the poop and I've tried that time they got it nothing to do for Rick but pick the hole and go marks Fergie comes up Dean Johnson a DA goes into the tight end 523 to go Oklahoma and Michigan are scoreless in the first quarter on the Orange Bowl first man through is lightly head across the 35 a gain of three it'll be second down and seven Anthony bride doesn't get the calls in the Preston's seulement brothers and Elrod yet but a good right tackle all 245 pounds of inmate to stop number 71 in your picture there don't think I've ever seen a team that has so much side and quickness to is Oklahoma's from Michigan to be moving the ball that they have is very impressive second down and seven leach look out on a back coming in and he curtain up hill ROM was coming in at the sodium uphill but we just got the first down Cindy Braun was coming all the way creating all of the backfield advances not across the 45 second fine resin Rick leach is made he goes back to throw but even when they do drop back there's still a chance that they're going to take off with it and this time a little hole open that's all he needs picks up another first down very nice play is you can have this ball on its own five first down out first down up to 45 quickly come on in oh and he's got another first down I believe that devolves into Oklahoma Territory down to the 44 yard line they Roy Selmon trailed at the biggest rock hole probably look back direction from up here does look like there's any room at all he's been finding most where only he can steal well they pulled the ball back exactly to the 45 and if he does not have the first job it's going to be a matter of inches and it's going to be a matter of inches up second down and that part ago well it's funny how you'll sit around Miami as we have done looking at Oklahoma looking at Michigan wondering what would happen if and the if turned out to be true this afternoon at Ohio State was bounced by UCLA and here we are for perhaps all the marbles in the 1975 season and the oxygen is running a little thin second down inches Lydell but the butler has the most out of the 41 you make a bad call running the ball on second one they'd like therefore those situations the way soma makes the stop now Pete Johnson 27 into the huddle lap Dean Johnson 88 or relation come down godson goes wide to the left of the top of the screen Jim Smith is flanked to the left Allen motion 1400 what a play there was that number 21 Sidney brown up to audience to make the stop and he made that play off McFadden because something did actually set up there and Mel was cutting any Tahoe Brown just too committed himself to fast put into him second down and 12 ball now back on the 44 of Oklahoma I'm running down we've got three minutes to go here in the first quarter Ocean bechler line coach for Michigan Michigan's all had been to the Rose Bowl before today one poor out of their six appearances quickly still has the football looking downfield what go eat Johnson part of deal at the 19 yard line could hold on to it with Gerry Anderson who leads the club in interceptions and Zach Henderson with it it was an excellent throw Jim will get a chance to see it little fake they've been moving the ball well on the ground first time he's really had time when he went back to throw the ball put it in the only place that could have been completed these receivers don't get many chances to catch the ball when they do they'd like to come down with it now it is third down and 12 the goal from the 44 of Oklahoma Johnson and Smith both go wide to the left on the quick count leading back under tremendous pressure gets away gets the ball walk across the 40 and vulnerable all of where they market you got it the worst on it for 30 long he made a great play he got out of the real big problems it was negative up early in the pocket when he did all his blockers just came right around picked him up got a little help point he's not thinking about throwing it now you see it goes back to throw jump in and do it and um it's got little feets up actually put him right around and pursuit was dead once they did that he got out they'd find play and Leroy finally caught it from spanis 4th down and inches to go on the 32 yard line Michigan looking to the bench income to tight ends Fergie and Johnson and apparently Bo Schembechler is told Rick leaks and company go forth do 22 left first quarter no score well at the excitement of the fact that this game could be for the national championship we forgot to tell you the weather in Miami has been absolutely delightful and is tonight more than inches now somebody move question is off that's what event I think the boat moved I don't know if anybody pulled the offensive left end off they did itself or Houma to jump a little bit I don't I think they're probably caught on both sides that will see Pistol Pete Williams will tell us ocean there and they're there Kurt threw the ball to do it defensively with an offensive movement that's your fault and it's all on the office so now John Anderson comes in and will punt the ball away nobody particularly deep at all for Oklahoma Anderson averaging about 38 yards per punt standing on his own 49 Henderson now backs up inside the 10 nobody's rushing an Anderson hang high and short beautiful there down there let's see if they can down it before it goes into the end zone and they do on the one football I don't Anderson puts it down to the 1 foot line 147 ago and now it is Oklahoma's turn to be at the hole where the first one of those going well I think of the three Orange Bowl games we played and I think of a lot of bronze great excitement tremendous pageantry and of course three wonderful wins we had with John Brodie Jim Simpson were both of the arms Bowl and so our Michigan and Oklahoma and about 80,000 others first down from the one that's Steve Davis getting a couple of yards off to the three it'll be second down and eight you can see why he wanted to get any kind of movement to get the ball out to at least a two or three yard line because that wishbone offense just isn't too effective throwing the ball around back in your own endzone they have definitely put an awful lot of pressure on both offense act the last time that Michigan has the ball tomatoes Dixie are driving still at the punt that's keeping them back there pretty good thinker on slaw to the right Oklahoma is still deep in the hole Steve Davis again and Davis I believe it's got the first out maybe just a little bit short Jim I call that last one suburban door where it leaves Davis carried a hundred and seventy one shot during the regular season and so did Joe Washington that is how much Steve Davis carries the football hi well you're right this time broad its third and inches Davis with the football has the first down out to the 20yard line and now both club deep in the hole have been able to rule the football down what they weren't they weren't able to move the ball from midfield but both teams being backed up and moved it right out of there if you haven't take a look little fake to Latrell Jo Washington makes an excellent block gives them an opportunity to get by the man training it's responsible for Essex good run 27 seconds ago first corner first down Oklahoma Davis hangs on for the football and get the couple of yards only well I don't know how much is there gelling is there and give Davis there he jumped all the way around the block came all the way down the line and great precision make a fine play all right that's the end of the first quarter everybody here and I'm sure you know as the national championship that's at stake but at the end of a quarter neither team has come close to scoring it's nothing nothing the biggest thing I remember at the Orange Bowl was that it was our 10th possibly to win the national championship they lost it was a big disappointment but it was a lot of fun anymore second down at the 23yard line for Oklahoma Barry Switzer and his staff offensive coordinator wick whacks sick those Steve Davis on every play telling me what it is he wants but well I'm pasta 35 first down for the dinner I know Dom dubeck I make the tackle Jim you can see David's makes excellent decision as does rick fitch you have to run that sort of an offense it comes down the line if anybody over plays their position just to literally open up a gap that's all he needs he usually makes the right one nigger Owens and now Elvis peacock both come wide right on first down go Washington with the would load up to the 39 yard line a gain of three and it'll be second and seven from there Tim gave us again that quick middle guard senior from Warren Ohio aims a stop and here's what happened the first quarter statistically I think those two zeros down at the bottom are pretty indicative of what you expect Michigan up second holiday was his Mexico and looking for kicker oh he's got a 15 I didn't take me long to be wrong there got back a whip one bigger bigger foot nine balls all year long that was a big moment for him let's take a look and if we get a chance we'll see singer come out of his pattern Davis drops back on a simple little fivestep drop puts the ball right on the money just as he comes out of his food here's a guy that will be drafted even though he has caught many balls he's got all the equipment thrown carry flag is down Tim Davis made the stop by the way we see Derrick our number 10 is and they're playing now the strong side Jim Pickens is out motion charts against Oklahoma State on all the Sooners move backwards anticipating that dobbed affect the defensive captain is going to say we want the yardage next of all back inside the 45 I have a legal motion against the whole right with offensive line the whole group if everybody on that right side he said including Terry Webb the allamerican guard the Muskogee Oklahoma first down Dipti no ins crops out to the left Victor Hicks the tie tenants on the right side Cottrell again the fullback and still on his feet as he gets off to the 48 yard line and it'll be second down in about 12 down at the bottom is moldboard and yes pearly 96 in your picture there's Calvin O'Neill the linebacker who led the club in total tackles individual and assists this year out of Saginaw Michigan 81 Dan gellick there they were wondering whether or not he'd be able to play because of a bad knee second down and 12 well again and gets up to the 50 yard line third down and 10 I think you'll find 35 down to Becker's around that ball along with again Moe Morton and Jim I think you will see the indicative thing at the pen 5yard penalty could really help hurt both these offenses because it doesn't change their strategy much first in 12 first and 15 it just doesn't matter much they're going to go right down that line pitching the ball in the open man and makes it a little tougher in Corrections now wide to the left and Davis is going back to throw setting up the screen up he can Oh accepted by purling or across the way do pick actually surprised Steve Davis a little bit on the plate Deeb's already had him counted out there is that wolf man our strong safety whichever you prefer to call him he did flit there's nobody to pick him up and he force he forced Davis to throw it screams of Koyuk ready here he got back it's nice to get a little piece off me give him a chance to throw when he did he almost got a picked off digger on Stan's back at his own 35 yard line Jim Smith deep man the rush is on and he gets it away but I want a fair catch all around him there corner Becker right in his face have you dropped it I don't know what or not they would have called it well down memory lane again we go well 41 to go and the first half there's no score the thing that I recall mostly was the fact that we were on the one foot line and I called I've played just before the half ended and we didn't score and I looked over and I saw Bear Bryant coming after me so I ran in a dressing room as quickly as I could from the Orange Bowl let's pause briefly for station identification this is the NBC television network you ever have to run to the dressing room as Pirelli did no but the babes not the only guy that's had to run away from the bear here's Jim Smith v breaks out across the 30 yard line and very close to first down number 17 Jerry Anderson and 40 build off he made the stuff their second time that plays worked effectively now v it's an excellent runner fine receiver in their structure they don't throw too much to him however when they do give him the ball he's very effective and dangerous Dean Johnson comes in and Keith Johnson goes up Dean Johnson is from Michigan same town same years Rick Lee the quarterback Gort evil has a little hole and makes the best of it across the 40 40 bells dragged down by number 7 Scott Hill on Amherst Texas it's just a basic little straight ahead I play most reaction was all done by Gordy belly pines just a little crack cuts back around doing summon but in yards and fine go scoreless ball game the ball is down to 42 first man through at Boykin evil that slightest love tailback very fast starter there is no squad this game as we said but the big score of the day Ohio State 10 at UCLA 23 in the Rose Bowl here you see a nice 5 yard play now in order to get that without a great run by any one of the facts you've got to get an awful lot of surge let's watch Jim Shearer take doing some it actually puts them all the way past the ball carrier that's just excellent offensive line play gain of 5 seconds on five from the Michigan 47 leech stomping back looking for cross for sperm Oh a great decimal was hit by Doc Henderson at the 34 yard line incomplete at his third and five what he actually did is he thought he was trying to make a safe catch he tried to get both hands on the ball and give himself up he doesn't he doesn't miss many of those the ball may have been just a little softer thrown than was necessary was so far open I think Rick wanted to make sure he got him and that's sometimes when you overthrow him or under thrown out for more gamblers we did not expect to see the ball in the air too often we've seen in the air plenty off third and five Rick beech nor Nivelle el cuts inside all dragged down by Jimbo Elrod so sought out the first down at the 49 yard line boy that guy's Dean he came out there everything was clogged up he cut back and the Bell rod doesn't get a hold of them that would have been elongated we have yet another punt God Addison goes back and yes sir number 24 is Jill Washington Anderson kicking for the third time back headed back to Washington is not all it's with five kicks to Washington back at the tip the person feel flag goes down in Washington goes down inside the 10 yard line that's a flag at the 13 and I'll talk it over Michigan's figuring it is against Oklahoma our referee tonight is he's been for so many of these harmful games as Pete would've bought Tom football star himself talking with Joe wash it's a cliff he gave us along the sidelines barry switzer is there but davis is talking to his offensive coordinator Oklahoma's not used to having to get that ball 90 yards down the field a score this game gets into a kicking contest John Anderson sure you Michigan an inch they marked the ball of the 8 yard line I'm Davis cross from the huddle can I want to go over the first half now they take them all back to market inside the bar I have a clipper against the red team during the run back again Oklahoma they have started from the one on one occasion now I'm from the for Michigan on one occasion started from it's five till they broke to come ready to come flood right and the officials are now sending them back into the huddle and I didn't know that a time have been fall but a melt in time has been called and so we'll take time out here at the Orange Bowl and go scored never want to go first half those are some before the bag feel bold ever been get the best out I did taking that I went ahead now red Ray's older than the head brother funky go give constructive advice and comfortable is back got it almost again second head Oklahoma with the football ropes comes up onto the right but well the first bamboo down he goes have the line of scrimmage devic is in there at the bottom didn't he 5 and there was a lot of quickness in there in Kim Davis alongside of Pearl ago this is a Michigan offensive squad being lectured to somebody's got to get something on the board to make something happen you bet running over the mill against the inane awful tough way to get it second down Tim as Davis going down near the goal well there is Dan jelly who made the stop number 81 think what that exposes most of all Jim is why they hate to run that sort of play down here by the goal line now they're in a position where possibly they can it needs tough penetration by their offensive line from defense flips through like shut down who that's all most would say me and he didn't have to do everything you could just keep get behind that white line third down and nearly 15 to go I'd look for a little Joe Washington quickly yeah absolutely going to get ready for the cover 17 Hicks and Hicks with excellent coverage downfield by Billy books is hip down efficient as excellent field goal or field range at the 37 we mentioned he might do this now ever this is not something to so unexpected Joe has done it over the year back example he has over a 50 yard average under these conditions the guy can do just about everything and there's not much any team can do when they're on the one foot line Carstens down for the Wolverines of Michigan 8:45 to go on behalf nobody's come close to score yet first man through is vital and Lionel gets down to the 35 yard line and Lee Roy Selmon enjoys sewing right there boy it makes it tough going in this group back take a look at Dewey and Lee Roy Selmon Leroy gets rid of the blocker makes contact at the line of scrimmage they're not going to pick up too many yards that way second down and eight to go Dean Johnson comes in there Switzer is the coach in the middle across the way it is hit coaching tenth with Oklahoma's lost only one game that was in 75 Ken Oh right off Anthony Bryant number 71 goes Gordie Bell of Duggan's inside a $35 and 33 where will be third down at about 7 where he and Elrod both just shot across that line of scrimmage before Bell could even get the ball I he made an excellent play just to get back to the line and pick up the artitude now Curt Stephenson comes in number 85 G Johnson comes out keep jobs in the gym Smith both wide to the left leach passing all the way looking for Jim Smith just a simple little everybody out for a long one a Jim Smith actually outran the secondary at most Henderson had Scott Hill had a pretty good position on him however he just straight on down straight on down the field out running here you see him well may have been a little over the wrong kind of like business come up silver will hold a Bob local attempt a 51yard field goal and that is going to be way short but will make it into the end zone and dust will come out to the 20yard line first down and ten and that is nearly as good as a fun seven might need to go and here we are the same old situation of the wonderful Orange Bowl Oklahoma and Michigan no score Queen Elizabeth's coronation was held a few months before I was close the North Pole Queen oh my gown was designed to look like hers the most beautiful gown I've ever worn today January 1st marks the start of NBC's 50th anniversary year in the introduction of our youth corporate symbol you'll be seeing a lot of a new symbol from now on and we hope you'll come to associate with a very festive broadcast a proud NBC has been an American tradition for 50 years and we look forward to the next years ahead the exciting challenges first down 10 here's Steve Davis pitching up to go Washington and Washington rambles up here the 30yard line knocked out of bounds at the 28 by Darren Howard the sophomore from Hamilton Ohio number 10 you'll notice that when they have the opportunity Mike Vaughn is such a great tackle get this position so often he may run the ball to the right four offices have left however that time Davis wanted to turn the ball up and run he knew he had Joe out there finally just let him have it without much sideline to work for this is Oklahoma's 24 play the game Michigan has had 30 Bob Luttrell is the ball near the first down at the 30 yard line debits down at the bottom mole Morton also getting up and Calvin O'Neil third down they're not going to call for the measurement inches to go that's it started at the 20 they know the nose of the football has to hit the 30 and it's just that short clock is running 6:40 to go here in the first half tinker on goes wide left Victor Hicks by 10 is on the side Davis has the first down tackled by on other Davis Kim Davis Davis caught Davis where they got enough birch out of there both offensive me very well banned Mike bone that time and what much left do just fall forward first down from the 33 yard line let's take a look at it here comes one we're both on they just gave people in and the deepest ball one Davis going 40 crow and he's gone second fence of the night first down at the 48 yard line beautiful throw the second one he's made to owe it to Mako for not however at there is a flag back there at the right where he was throwing the ball but be holding Oklahoma is marching back oh it's his walking back I think it's a pretty good indication the Michigan is making Oklahoma put the ball up in the air they've got to give a little something away defensively in the backfield to stop these this wishbone attack they are doing that pretty effectively you're going to have to leave some vulnerability somewhere while I'm talking to Barry Switzer the other day and asking about his passing game he said well when you're second and five and second of course we almost always are or third and two why should we throw the ball so might they have arrangement of those two ran team or third and two holding is charged the ball goes back to the 18 yard line I can understand his logic I want to see what he does when it's now what is first down at 25 28 first op 28 to go there's the thrill run straight ahead for a couple of yards the man they had not used tonight as a man from right here in Miami Florida and his friends been him the Elvis peacock is back home and he's got friends he didn't know he had back here they all wanted an Orange Bowl ticket Elvis peacock has not handled a football tonight he's got fine speed but when they go to the left and that wishbone gets into operation he'll get plenty of opportunity and for the evenings over I'm sure would be a bit bit of second down at about 22 to go ball is on the 21 and a half low kleh Houma always make soup her gadget with a wellthrown ball by David Haye they knew they were going to throw however they did leave the middle of the field pretty well open oh it's just kind of plays off the defense the back comes up with the ball let's take a look at he runs right out of kids on him as fast as he can now he gets off um that's just fine he's got it all the way wide Hicks was right women but there's not much you can do with that play and its first down Oklahoma at the Michigan 39 telling Brooks has come in to replace Owen and here books in the bio he was getting a rank at the great block across the 30 39 yard run over first ball that was some impressive thing about is making a defense they weren't as fooled as they were out executed they had a man coming around the park looking for because absolutely jump in when he did is set up the whole wall ran a ride in that's beautiful let's take a look it's supposed to look like like a wishbone play out to be Cochran still have to carry the ball this is sad right here Brook cuts up you tried between websurfer play no they broke the senior from Austin Texas on 39 yard Rob we're going to see it again and I got a bit twotoone he scores this time although just outdid the play itself that's I think those great athletes can't make a good two through Bibles double to go we are in the first half on Oklahoma looking for the national title as scored first and meets Michigan 7 nothing it's our orange rose from against the river prescribing pain to happen to be in my college career and of course we want the game that made it even more exciting Jim Simpson and John Brodie in the Orange Bowl in Miami Jim I asked him earlier what are they going to do on first and 25 they seem to have the answer for that one to pass towards and the first two books is Tony D Renzo kicks it off and Gordie Val at the oneyard line him del gets across the 22 about the 22 and now Michigan the final one to go takes over the football Pony beaters well that's his brother Terry Peters made the tackle Tony Peters is now on the national football team he graduated from Oklahoma a year ago on the 21 well two outstanding plays the catch by Tinker horns and give great credit of course to Steve Davis for having groaneth haven't run by Billy Brooks the wide receivers the split ends of Oklahoma have looked good out in front seven nothing Gregg Leakes turns it up deal and not much running room at all and she gets from the 21 to the 24 yard line Anthony Bryant is down at the bottom of the pile along with Jimbo Elrod and it'll be second down and seven to go it's about this time that we not only anticipate the rest of the football game but began to look ahead to halftime and the Orange Bowl pageant always a wellkept secret of what it is but being a Bicentennial year I think you could guess leech ups inside Jimbo Elrod and gets up to the 30yard line and its third down and about one after you need moral vibes ago actually this play was pretty well executed they made each charge the two plays that's that's about par for the course against Oklahoma's fine but here's Jimbo Elrod trying to play this option play he does it pretty well you need some help he did get a little from Anthony Brian late good thing he got it he Johnson goes on wide to the right Michigan has had its opportunities going deep into the end zone means back to throw now for jumps of the net will be out of bounds and it'll be fourth down and Michigan will have to kick the ball away situation where at least been able to come off and look for Jim Smith underneath him he found him open the past brushes what keeps you from being able to look around too long and that's what they had a lot of that time John Anderson standing at about his 14 yard line and Joe Washington is inside his own 35 Anderson gets away a fine kick sending Joe Washington back inside his own 25yard line right off to football still lose two poles on it at the 20yard line did the right thing because when you that ball starts bouncing around on that turf it can go anywhere and I've seen a lot of backs trying to make a great play out of a fumble punt and most of them go broke trying this time Joe makes the first attempt to pick it up he sees the crowds getting a little close falls on the ball that's the way to make it all when we come back its first in 10th Oklahoma their own 20 they lead by the score 7 nothing 324 left in this first half as Billy Brooks come fly to the right the crown vics across the 20 yard line where is Russell down by a three or four including Calvin Odile FP she launches its coverage of college basketball 76 Saturday at 4 o'clock eastern time notre dame at UCLA featuring Adrian Dantley of the iris rich Washington of the NCAA

NCAA finals of March the 29th be on NBC Sports number one in live coverage the pages force events all around Davis pitching back elvis peacock got his chance that was run out him out they were just testing his balancing act I believe Jim because he got the ball about a foot inside the line still made 67 yards out of it that's a nice play Derek Howard ran him out of bounds he'll be third down and four to go from the 26 of the boomers who knows Oklahoma 245 left temperature in the high 60s rook spot right on third down Davis back to throw cannot get away does not get the first down and Oklahoma will have to kick it back to Michigan he this has been a kicking game tonight it really has but he's been able to pick up the knees yardage I believe but his offensive line was in there and kind of hung him up a little bit now Jim Smith goes deep tinker on has made several catches tonight including one out Santa gets it helped set up the touchdown stands back on his own 11 to do the kicking you can get a pretty good test just catching those those snap backs there's you get a lot of people up front gets the King away and it's taken by Dwight Hicks X's across the 45 to the 48 yard line where with two minutes to go Michigan's got the football first down 10 on Sunday the AFC Championship game bus grandstand before during and following the game hosted by Jack buck and ride double and I'm sure you know who's in there the Oakland Raiders looking for the Pittsburgh Steelers or the defending champions in the Superbowl that will be right here on NBC Sports number one in live coverage of Mesa sports events all year round it will start at 1 o'clock Eastern Time Keith Johnson Jim Smith both wide to the left rick leach bitching back to Jim Smith and bullying nobody right there was Sidney brown playing his quarterback spot and spent that no place to go simple little misdirection play again trying to get the flow slowed down by Oklahoma they have been pursuing tremendously all night its third time they've given it to Smith on a similar type play although all three of them were a little bit differently designed that time it didn't work loss of five second down fifteen and then if they have to go Johnson us to the right this time Smith to the left and Zack Henderson is playing center field and at Oklahoma defense lates putting it up for Smith over his head and off the hands of number 17 Jerry Anderson's what a cept at five during the regular season just a little bit high however he was in the hole if the ball had been thrown in the proper place it would have been a big quiet third down brick cleats a freshman in his first full game Steve Davis a senior in his first bowl game Rick's going to be in several more and I know Steve is a good deal responsible for having gotten Oklahoma into this one Johnson right Smith left at leech back to throw under pressure from Leroy and now goes out of bounds and Wow this mr. Jerry Anderson let him have it as you what about paying the price he didn't get out of a swag quick enough he takes the ball across the 45 it's a long way to go I don't think Mosin too happy about it either sing a few words to one of the officials that's el Zynga they're the backup quarterback of junior Don Anderson comes in to kick the ball away Jill Washington is deep along with sack Henderson bill told dick though Washington says Oliver fair catches it bounces inside the 10yard line and will go out of bounds I do believe at the 11th one on't you to go and the Cooper Sooners of Oklahoma take over there's Jim Smith along the sidelines as we look at the Michigan bench Oklahoma's been waiting a long time to get here can you imagine quarterbacking a team having 31 wins one loss in one time never happened into the bowl before that's Steve Davis if I could get 31 and 1 I'm not sure I care too much to me because you might not have retired that's a pretty good average follows on the 10 dick your own scum squad right flag goes down as Latrobe there's a football for not much Rick leach is being ministered to here and he is the one that got it as he went out about so that's why Bo Schembechler was talking and that's why L Ginga was there leeches up and apparently alright and he'll have nearly a half the offensive left on the red team being the snap 5yard penalty which they refused to make it second down and ten as a freshman that started the first game of the year for Michigan and roared white with them what other questions that's gone a long way too deep Davison down he goes fine play made by number 40 Mike Holmes right in I think there may call time out the calling time Michigan is calling time with 31 seconds to go ocean Beckler talking to Dwight Hicks who was a sophomore from Pennsauken New Jersey he has a definite message in mind I believe there is talk about records look at that a Bo Schembechler it's 1969 they've lost only to one team that team lost today the Buckeyes of Ohio State in case you did not hear UCLA 23 to 10 and as we told you with leech injured marquel Singh at just in case he's out of Bay City Michigan a junior is warming up as leach heads for the dressing room it's like he's still shaken a little bit well zinger will warm up just in case they get the football in this half whether or not leach can come back we don't know third down and a little bit more than 15 to go for Oklahoma Michigan like one more shot at the football in this hand Davis heading off the Elbert peacock peacock knocked out of bounds would stop the clock he does not up the first down and Oklahoma will have to punt the ball away with 25 seconds left to go in the half the Ole Miss score came with 507 to go in this first half tinker Owens made a superb catch at the 39 and on first down the split end around Billy Brooks took at 39 yards into the end zone gone ad added the extra point and that's where we are 7 nothing punting is very important right now Jim he's got to get that ball at least 30 yards down the field or he can set something up for Michigan to get a field goal before half white Hicks down field all is very short and Michigan may have a shot professor right down near the 30yard line was 16 seconds to go but it will be marked L Zynga the junior from Bay City it was only been in there and up to throw 19 times all year who will be quarterbacking and he's getting the word from both Jim back and asking for earlier in the week about this guy's abilities he says hey he's an excellent thrower I asked if maybe he didn't throw a little more when he was playing he said not necessarily he's adapted well to our situation he goes down he does the same things that Rick does when he's playing and that it's just the ability has to throw the ball very well I've assembled team Johnson 27 and Jim Smith 37 wide to the left Oh Joey summited like that he came across him hit the man and then walked ten yards deep in his old backfield and that's a big fiveyard penalty he knew it do because that puts it in a very makable range thank you if we can't tell yep we can't like he hit a hot stove about the fan and of course when you say in range you mean for bill gold that's right thanks the ball down to the 26 yard line and I'll quickly Kurt Stephenson comes in number 85 and Fergie a tight end comes out so we have Johnson and Stephenson both wide receivers in there Johnson sniffing to the left and Stephenson to the right first down in five Elsa goes back to throw as the time and looking at it is incomplete indebted for Jim Smith at the 10yard line Box Tops 11 seconds we go on the half one of the few times tonight when they win either team has thrown that they didn't have a receiver open that time L Singh have put the ball in the only place he could Elrod was covering him very well short and deep he had nowhere to go Bob wood number three they have a shot at dicking a field goal from London Ohio second down five I was going to put it up again always wide open space and he over time as he walked right into the coverage of number 17 Anderson and continue straight down but that's where the ball was thrown and that stops the clock it might ring on Bob wood I think it will they're actually Anderson was dropping back and he had to play I thought pretty wellcovered it's hard to see him in the corner of that end zone back there but that's about the only coverage he had to make sure he had anything but it but a touchdown was fine by Oklahoma well they won't spot this ball in about the 36 total beam a 46 yard attempt or thereabouts seven or nothing the Michigan fans everywhere a little upset that Rick leach has been led to the dressing room Larry zuver 8 is the holder Bob wood is the field goal kicker you ever mentioned earlier that they set them up in a pretty good field goal position he now only has 43 yards to actually actually complete that's a big difference from 48 they're getting the screen up behind the goalposts at Michigan what six seconds to go would like to get something on the board they've come close tonight but Oklahoma's the only team that has scored there's no doubt about that only Brooke scramble those 39 yards the 43 yards out and it is not going to be enough and the half ends and you've got the score Rick Lee is in the dressing room Michigan goes to the dressing room with no score but Oklahoma with a possibility of winning the national championship tonight central Ohio state loss leads seven to nothing our first trip to the Orange Bowl was against Alabama and as people recall we did get no 61 to 6 but I got a tray of a great experience for the kids that anyone that has a chance to go to the Orange Bowl will never forget a oneyearold diehard our first trip to the Orange Bowl was against Alabama and as people recall we could get no 1606 but I got it says a great experience for the kids that anyone that has a chance to go to the Orange Bowl Eric because a 1 year old diehard a two year old diehard a three year old diehard and a four year old diehard more than three hours later they all started even the four year old diehard the diehard with extra power to start your car when most batteries won't sold only at Sears I'm not an actor I'm a small businessman but for over two years now you've seen me in this commercial I'd like to get rid of some of the great but not all of it Grecian formula 16 lets you control just how much gray slowly get rid of some of it most of it or all of it two years ago I used it every day for about three weeks until I got rid of just as much gray as I wanted it's as easy to use as water no mess won't rub off now I use it just once a week or so to keep it this way Grecian formula 16 dim sum switch on Brody reminding you if a fan a tional championship could be started in the second half of this ballgame but we are at halftime it will have this wonderful Orange Bowl halftime pageantry in just a moment but now from Miami let's pause for station identification emergency followed by Harry in your pocket starring James Coburn Saturday first off at halftime the pride of Oklahoma the University of Oklahoma marching band on the music one of the right service between three killed in artistry in rhythm you you 1976 ha ha you there are a lot of boomers superfans here with a lot of Wolverine fans too and coming in now is the University of Michigan marching band of the direction of Robert Reynolds now we've asked five and Oklahoma and now Michigan to find Team Obama leaving seven others have died having cut the pageantry of the armful coming up but now from Miami let's pause for station identification emergency followed by Harry in your pocket starring James Coburn Saturday okay long gone I really not concerned too much I you know the activity and when I see them okay okay it's okay my face this 1976 Orange Bowl game has been brought you by Pontiac the mark of great car and by Goodyear Goodyear tires and put your service a more good years in your car the vans there the arm full of Miami hello again and Happy New Year again that's the Michigan van an ox Jim sense with John Brodie it a seven or nothing Oklahoma let us again selfesteem if you put your microphone back on oh and we'll talk about what's to come up after the battery and that is the fact that Oklahoma knows tonight since Ohio State loss today the possibility of a national championship is theirs and Michigan know that if they can beat Oklahoma well that makes their season first calm Michigan's ever been outside of a Rose Bowl that's true Jim I you know I've been impressed with it by the fact that although Oklahoma doesn't throw the ball very much when they do they do it very well and they have two excellent wide receivers and both tinker Owens and Billy Brooks I didn't know Steve Davis could throw the ball as well as he does it's just the form of offense they play I guess that keeps them from throwing it more when they did get it first down in 25 yards to go he didn't have much trouble getting out of the hole and actually that's the only drive they put together all night it was very impressive to me on the other hand Michigan came out knowing they should throw some they have thrown they haven't thrown very successfully they've had Jim Smith open a couple of times leach doesn't put the ball where he would like to put it there's a question we don't know is Rick leach going to be able to plant the second half and I don't know either but I do know they're gonna have to put the ball up a little bit more if they're going to run the ball against or remove the ball against Oklahoma because the Zelman brothers and Anthony Bryan have just done a superb job all right we have that second half coming up at first we have the pageant red white and blue and allamerican Orange Bowl proudly celebrates our country's 200th birthday in patriotic style with us halftime pageants entitled red white blue and allamerican a special tribute to those Gallup men and women of our armed forces who boldly serve as the guardians of our freedom Oh today are me Hey let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself and so my fellow Americans ask not what your country can do for you and what you include be honest I have a dream one day this nation will rise up live out the true meaning of its Creed on the eve of the 200th anniversary of the creation of these great United States let us all rededicate ourselves to the proposition that this cell forever be one nation under God with liberty and justice for all and a cell being red white and blue forever and forever allamerican Oh you we hold these truths to be selfevident all men are created equal they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights among these are life liberty and the pursuit of the yes Oh Valley yarns Bowl committee has done it again under the direction of Dan McNamara a wonderful halftime ceremony in Oklahoma with a knowledge at Ohio State as lost today is shooting for the national championship Michigan of course once this game at the half Oklahoma seven Michigan nothing and now again more nostalgia and that's just to again to a participant of one of our previous 41 orange bones in the girls daily game send a or spoke very uh entertained us royally in Miami has a tremendous whether in system it's all real great hurt I could Miami jumps up to a job brought here comes to go over sooner people Oklahoma and the Wolverines of Michigan at five Oklahoma leading by the score of seven or nothing and another tremendous halftime ceremony as we can see the national championship decided here in the second half drop voting whichever I pay you can walk around in town with goose pimples for a week or so heaven watch that happen ceremony and there's a few people a little uptight about the second half of this ballgame the ironic thing is this that both teams have really moved to fall about evenly as far as any statistical data is concerned on the ground however in the air the peep in for Oklahoma has slipped Michigan's a tone that they haven't completed a pass yes on the other side of the ledger Steve Davis being two for three in the first half for 51 yards that statistic doesn't seem like much but it was the real contributor and the one driver was made tonight well it's all for college football games Ohio State that will change after their loss today to UCLA 23 to them Oklahoma which leads here Alabama which knocked off Penske to the Super Bowl last night at Michigan which is here two of the four are year boys at the beginning a game it's Oklahoma's joy they want the football which in will you defend the pin that go put your backs to the gold please all right shake hands and good luck to your gang with all of the upsets we've had on this postseason bowl line up the top set will change appreciably after they're all over now again here the statistics that John was talking about I think we can see very basically that rushing the ball both teams have been effective but not overwhelming and throwing the ball is it's what's made the difference and I don't think many people expect it particularly from Oklahoma Steve Davis two out of three Rick leach Oprah died and was getting the sidelines nala see if leach has come back on an appeal he was shaken up just before the end of the first half and L think I have to go in that's academic for the moment because Oklahoma will get the football first Hill Washington is back deep and Elvis peacock is bhakti and Bob wood will kick it off Washington 24 D number 470 nothing on the 39yard Rada Billy Brooks for 5 minutes and 7 seconds to go in the first half that's Bob wood who will kick it off taken by one of the up men and that is the thrill at m'appelle izikoff the 35 yard line and up to the 38 Steve Davis number five in the back to deal with Joe Washington 24 Jim withdrawal 42 Elvis peacock number four ding currents 11th only hooks 82 alternate at the split em Victor Hicks no radio fight em all is Wyler and the USS pawn of the tackle jazz Evans and allamerican Terry Webb with guards and Dennis Buchanan is at 7 angelic deaf bourlingueur Jim Davis Oh Morton Mike Holmes the board wall for Michigan Galileo named Devin two linebackers down connected off man Howard Hicks and Pickens too deep them go Washington and hemmed in as he gets to the 40 yard line it will be second down and seven she turned out the FIR the second half just like the first running down the line and they've got they've got the ball and good field position it seems like David wants to turn the ball up and look from the defensive structure that that's what they're going to make him do however that time they didn't he was a little late throwing the ball to Joe and that's why couldn't get any Running Room Saturday from the Oklahoma Curtain I the thicker Owens going wide left this jobs of peacock Domino Neil is there and they can spot the flag goes down at the 38 yard line Domino Neil leading the club and backwoods of the preseason number 96 vapor stop not here's beat with holding guards against Oklahoma they almost came up with the ball to David that made a real quick that dish to get that fall outside he had enough penetration to make him pop it up and all we've been talking about the fact that should Oklahoma win here tonight that it could be voted the national champion the people in Arizona I would have answered the saying at this time hey what about us we are undefeated that we knocked off Nebraska as I said that's up to the voters not up to us yeah we're not in that category I think we opened her mouth enough last year Joey Leroy saw a little longer sidelines and they're still making the decision and now they make the decision to take the big tunnel thanks of all back inside the 25 at the 23 I'm holding against number 24 the red team so Washington is fingered for them what is second down that long long Garden about 24 till Washington Oh Oh fine play made by Dan gellick number 80 watt or else Washington might have gone for a lot more well joy had made that place he's exciting Washington when he gets the ball he genic was just the right position had he got loose there wasn't much left back there third down at 21 ding caroli example superb gets wide to the right Jim pulled it over there with him Steve Davis going to Ron Oh Carly and doctor he'll be knocked down at the 26 yard line it'll be fourth down and they picked up all the way to Michigan they're stringing it out awfully well now Michigan hasn't played against the wishbone offense much this year there was a little speculation as to how well they were defense that is one offense they if he pays pretty well tonight and Jeonju Peck has been doing his job every time out of the box we'll take a look beat back comes down throws the block now the reason the ball is thrown out to Washington any earlier is they get get any hoping to throw it out there gupx been carrying it down the line just good job by everybody Martin Holmes made the stop is oh it stinks them all away by hex takes the bear cuts in the 38 yard line I'm now fishing them we'll go on with the veal Barney down is up there Rob Lydell is out there and marquel Zingo will go out there Rick leaps we've got heard from Michigan yet but leads you how's everybody the second half from the gourd evil number five final 41 hips to 37th and helsing a 16 and Elzy go running off and getting some self yardage across the 40 to the 40 Bri Keith Johnson 27 in three marksburg 82 the night ends Steve King Mark Donohue Jim Cyr Walt darling build you think your wall that's Steve Davis on the far side Mike Phillips Roy Selmon doing Sullivan Anthony Brian Jimbo Elrod 5r Oklahoma David Thomas and Bill Koch here the linebackers Sydney Brown and Terry Anderson the corners Scott Hill and Zack Henderson to safely it is second down and about five seven to nothing Oklahoma early in the second half what evil they'll push stop here the first down at the 48 yard line good offenses first Jim both on both played the first play including Mark Donohue and Steve King they really did a good job right down the left side of the line they got they got the defense moves back and helping with able to pick up five yards before anybody really got a good piece of them I'm Ashley Gordon spell picked up most of it on its own but that's the way michigan's going to have to move the ball if they're gonna get back in this game Richard burr a sophomore from Greenville Texas number 76 comes in as a six man up front on third down and short and he'll siga may have taken too much five and putting third down at about 6:00 instead of third and one and that's what happened I wonder how much I wonder how much of that was due to the fact that Helsing went up and look for something and was about ready to make an audible well he had six men up brought for that six lineman and they think an out Scott Hill that's what causes you to do a little thinking 11:57 ago in the third quarter of all out the 43 delay gentle white team we are checking with the Michigan representatives of the press box to find out one of our freshmen Rick leaves I can't even find him out there too darted about six elves Inga under tremendous pressure a realized omen on his feet and does not have the first doubt I don't believe across the 45 about the 47 Eldin had turned a pretty good loss into a into a fine gain that time he showed that he is very movable out there he can or I shouldn't say move all that he moves very well and that boy is required when you're playing those Rangers John Anderson is going back to pump the injury report we have now on directly chizz a slight concussion the Washington one of the deep man this is the sixth one of the night for Anderson took a long time it got a very high Washington s call for the fair catch and does in a crowd at the 22 yard line will be first and ten for Oklahoma 11:27 ago third quarter score remains the same suitors seven we will raise sheep Sutton the orange burrows

don't need it you keep it well he said that because they only have X amount of scholarships to give he came on there and 50 only had one or two years to play under that condition he just let him give it to some other fella that could go for four and they said he's been a real help with second down and four to go from the 28 over the local football loss to Michigan come across the football for Michigan's Angelica my covers of the 46 yard line and joyful to watch others be paid to put him out of the game I know I thought bill talking excited you almost got injury over at bubbles you like mix it up take a look here you can see what's been doing a fine job or pizza we move people out of there however that time the biscuits left side of the line just penetrated few fat they turned over and that's the way the games going George Mozgov skis in for the first comp about at night NL take a pitcher back to court eval Rockford pulled in as well gets down to the 4 yard line Oklahoma leads by 7 but here come the Wolverines of Michigan and they did something that time they jumped everybody out of the bill got started real fast before I think Oklahoma really got dead it's the best opening that work fellows had to run with the ball even though he only picked up five yards eight Johnson 27 comes in and the Scots key comes out Johnson goes wide to the right Jim Smith large of the left second down and about four hours ago looks like a fixup today no matter you think self a couple of yards b8d wears one on a mound there by number 40 build okay there's little doubt there was a mixup I don't think he's thinking any odds and we want to get five people play was designed for an option to go to the left side he turned out that little dick stuff he really made a pretty good play out of it often but you can see here he thinks it'll idle gets out there puts a few moves on however these nuts will in the whole group barks muggy the freshman from Cincinnati is on the sidelines but are working on his left shoulder third downs for John Intel finger carries the football very close for the first down but it looks like he is a little bit shy at the 18 yard line joy Solomon Jimbo Elrod to all American bears Fergie and that's the left shoulder they're working on horse down he stops it comes in Michigan obviously is going to go for and again Richard Murray comes in as a six line when Scott Hill comes out of the Oklahoma defense off down on the arm kaltaka said I can't hear oh this will be Williamsville disgusting the backs of a big crowd to it here the officials yelling we need some help with the noise he needs to cut it down now Jim Smith is gonna come back in tell me with another plan Pete Johnson will go out i forth in the yard and now more echoes Adam Scott Hill the other safety man comes back in as Jim's got checked in I'll take a geek he's got the first down I do believe at the 50yard line get by simple Elrod with marquel Singham up days city makes the first down okay take off nipple little option play again he finds a little penetration when I say little I to be existent just a small spot up there in the left side of the line take that he makes my a lot of football link that's but all he had to make it though on assembly go over the third quarter the Sooners of Oklahoma lead simple nothing the Wolverines of Michigan are on the March spit those part of the way Thompson comfortable housing against the football itself and gets down to the 12 yard line where Michael brother Bill donkey made the stop I'm reporting little counter play Jim we haven't seen it all night it may be the same play that was supposed to happen on the previous time when it looked like he was all alone out there this time Gordon Bell came with him and he did have the option to throwing it out there with yet found blue hole Kurt Stephenson California sophomore 85 checks in Goff's and comes out he'll be second down and about six from the 12 Smith wide right Stephen to the left housing an accordion bill now has come flocking it gets down inside the 9 yard line perhaps the 8 when will be 3rd at about 3 Mike gulps / 89 he saw 191 in on the tackle I pay also all tanning in there and bill to fix but a good offensive third John he didn't get as many yards he likes but those guys are moving pretty well right now Richard Murray back into that one 6 novo almost got hill is out third and three a quick pitch to go to down vonnegut around the party oh my something brothers put all bow and vide Brown decided tried running out of there going to drop down to one yard line I believe that's what a marketing within the info could have come under the foot but they'll mark it at the wall take a look from ground level that's what it looked like the man I'm trying to throw for with that 55 foot eight and nine it was predetermined to throw the ball he did feel they just wolf City Brown however and that's the way it goes bringing the ball out for the 20 yard line and that brings the ire of the Michigan plan saying outcome 730 wants ago and welcome back the suitors of the football Anthony love it Yoriko committee had everything really planned out at a trip highlight game the trip around this game page different things they took the student was really planned out it's really exciting for me and have been a long way from different at always Michigan fans want to know how come well John forty knows how Company marker that's funny I do now but I didn't just a minute ago Jimmy cooking just out of the end zone but in college football anytime the ball is in the end zone you cannot run it out it was rule just to touch back and these fans went a little wild for a while because anybody could see was knocked out on the oneyard line however he could not he could not get charged Rick leaches back it looks like he will not be back in there nothing he still looks a little longer that's going to understand the ruling but that's the ruling at Oklahoma does deserve the football not that's what a on the interception by Cindy brown and it's the Michigan end of the field that's setting up the hoop law right now forcing the Oklahoma Sooners back enough while we wait we'll remind you that some help we go out of the frying pan into the fire we got a free river stated in Pittsburgh and Oakland will be there against Pittsburgh for the AFC Championship now to remember grandstand before joining part of the game with Jack buck and Ron jumble 50 grams have to heat up gear you know the rule straight ahead goes Cobra I bought the thirtyfirst out of the pretty for joy makes to stop along with Jim Vickers what I was an excellent Roger you know he still just a little bit pride from the previous bubble Jim make up for it all of us and that's pretty good start Michigan has had opportunities tonight but the likes of the Roy Sullivan &amp; Company I've kept them out of their kindig Leroy noises on demo anything he's got dripped a stripper you mean hoarding will go Washington across the 40 to the 42 Jim Dickens again it on the stop take another look right over the top of of my chronic can he can just give that man a crack and he's going to make something of it that's just a nice open field broken eight guard run I called the senior from Accra to say come on man let's top of it suck it down into second man through again to Washington across the 45 first cut Oklahoma at the 47 you can feel things starting to break right now Jim it's the first time this stick in a long wild at Oklahoma really gave you the feeling that they were going to move the ball on offense and you can just kind of feel it the whole stadium carpet goes out of a crowd 42 comes in october's Jews of Joe Washington and I'm informed they are and paint it I don't think the manufactured Pecos they was going to throw first down and gets it out there and there was a man again Pinker always went on about by vitac first God at the boarding and quite if there's an awful tough job in silico for me is throwing the ball when they do it's really set up perfectly and David put the ball right on the money as you can see here he's got everything going for him perfect situation for the play back with the ball on the money oranges he's open because he's all alone and and stuff we have government Elvis peacock the Miami take them all out of the 35 various pitches that we're all alone out here and is lost Colorado law from grass to lost areas that we are the big eight champions no champion so we are here and we're all alone Rica making its first appearance outside of the local granting seven to nothing and Oklahoma I'm sure you know with the preseason victory number one of the country due to the loss of Ohio State this afternoon that could happen in the final voting crowd all close okay all the loss to Michigan another fumble so Washington fumble the football and Michigan gets yet another chance a little deal that my balls come over thrilled a lot of the 34 yard line let's take a look you you see all this big car coming right into the hole looked at me like gellick made a real fine play to tip the ball over finding that ball cross crowd wants to let it go credit that fumble the peacock and credit the fumble recovery to Albinoni our thumb from a thirty more party felony has been hamstrung mostly evening he's been exciting but he hasn't picked up too much guarded he's up to 35 second of nine sorry Switzer party Bell who gained nearly 1400 yards has 34 thus far tonight second down and nearly ten to go five minutes to go here in the third quarter he Johnson comes to the left Smith Mike's left L singer in there going back look out are yelling against the wall up and out of our dropping off both way backers to the best that's what happened with the second down and play acts passed yet yet nobody is here but all five defensive lineman and he did the best he could by throwing the ball out of bounds out of the first half Michigan was over nine passing there now all four he loved it third down about ten to go Johnson again wine left L Jigga the junior filling it that most of mcleach has a concussion elves ago look up their egos simple Elrod Lee Roy Selmon to all Americans including the Outland Trophy winner even though he had a good brush that time he had no one open their kid in there so fast that they're not allowing any of the bishop of receivers to really set up get into their pattern we take a quick look here and we can see Lee Roy Selmon just discarding new offensive linemen and he is even the first man back there not and us with the gift of all await and go Washington in psyche Henderson Anderson now getting inside his tent they were covered the bump of the 34 another pine kicked by Anderson go Washington fall for the Bearcats at the 36 back in the 26 yard line off Michigan a flag is down personal bow looks like we'll hear the words of meet Williams and he'll tell us I hope we hear the words will be Williams and others talking things over with Dom defect the allamerica the defensive captain this must be some kind of penalty it's thinking about a minute that explain it in fact yelling to the sidelines devotion but it wasn't a very good fun I do believe at Michigan just an opportunity they will take the penalty even if they have to punt again and it goes in without saying these two seem to have different new points about that how they how they do punt the ball Oklahoma's tries to hold up everybody at the line of scrimmage which really gives the punter a whole lot more time with wish to kick the ball on the other side of the coin the Michigan suits everybody in ask the punter got a legal participation by the red team well it'll dissipate all out of participating in the play all the word for getting along oh Anderson will kick the ball away again all been on the deal as too many folks it's your definite edge though that's all one team can't as possible aren't older one year at penn state water 12 in on the Peter Adamson gets it away tanking it off to the right and it goes out of bounds inside the 35 yard line no market at the 32 357 to go third quarter Seminole nothing Oklahoma let's go down memory lane and the previous orange balls once more we play Texas and another one full game of 65 we was national champions perspective beaters that day 21 17 and that was one of the most variable speeds ever suffer still part of the team the second jumps up to John 14 Rick leads tries to walk it off on the sidelines and down athey em Childre left Oklahoma Banias coming let's go big red the Sooners have the football on the wrong 32 Davis going on first donger crying moving out stuffing inside beautiful coladas from it at Calvin O'Neill makes the stop of the 40 I'm taking up abandoned will be second down and two raid 38 to go third quarter let's take a look at Calvin O'Neil be cemented always plays on the wide side of the field which which means he's the guy that's always in most of the accident particularly his Oklahoma plays it drops back because he knows it's bad now when Davis takes off to run either a very sure tackler and tough to get out of that may is Brad second and short yardage but the group's agenda there's wide to the left awkward is the list man through and he may have to first down off to the 44 yard line carry on backed by purling or and debits it is a first down well Oklahoma lost only one that was to Kansas when they turned the ball over to less than eight times right they've been holding on to that football and they've got the lead seven to nothing I'll grip make to him David with the football Davis with another first down pitching out the peacock that just makes credibility to repeat who's coming around and when you can throw it through it that time David cut upfield made a perfect break you do peacock is coming around later he cut to the outside just give them the ball but just one point enough room up here you see him jump up inside now that draws everybody in you throw the ball out the oven just a little bit late bring good play Oklahoma on the march of the 43 offers of the football Adana beginning us you up you skunks in that Michigan defensive line and to move the ball inside the 35 do peckin Pickens in on the stop and there is leach often throwing again we may see Rick meets come in but a second down and three Oklahoma you mentioned you had a slight confession I I wonder if they ask Rick about that ropes to the right Davis nuts over Walkman it just does get back to the line of scrimmage so now it is third and two Erlanger up there to make the stop number 97 I was running out here in the third quarter you should have seen the excitement here as better the fan for watching one of our television monitors on the field but UCLA was upsetting Ohio State yet everyone in the stands with you what was happening invited the public address announcer before the game announced would happen number one Ohio State had been upset that's the monitor they were looking at and we had a bigger craft fair as we had to the entire stadium that BC launcher discovered some college basketball 76 this Saturday at 4:00 p.m.

one of live coverage of ASA sports events all year round you'll see Indiana you will see Maryland you will see Notre Dame UCLA Providence Kentucky Louisville and others and we are watching Steve Damon so they're talking with very Switzer and I know that he would like to throw the ball he he put the ball on the money every time he has a chance picking up four yards against Michigan's defense on the ground although they've been able to do it both the year is a very difficult job and I kind of look for my little spring out action to the right throw the ball was tied in third down about four to go of the ball on the Michigan 36 yard block with 136 to go to third quarter Kelly Brook's remains and he is for the only touchdown five to the right new davis cuts inside first cow steve davis it's like all of course I'm not gonna round but it'll be longer Oklahoma at the 20yard line nice way to gain an extra yard first step depth of the footy for Steve Davis mid an excellent play make the call to call breath comes around he's got Joe Washington and you know the dog is gonna let him get away cuts it up inside gets the first down before he fumbles Joe tries to pick it up on a run but he does move an eightcar looks goes wide to the left in Sakai dentist but a couple of yards to the left first man through is culprit and he gets down to about the 17 yard line Dave debits number 55 is in the form of that file it's three that'll be second down and seven ago a lot of time left I'm three been watching with us prickly to longer sidelines obviously will not put all here drama sneaking off a little bit on the ball warming up he may come back at the ball game and he may not what's the left peacock and Washington Davis along the whole way off it has been in there a little bit more luttrell Davis become feedback picks it up on a perfect bow and go about the one or two yard line but the flag is knocked up deal at the 15 so hold everything is Oklahoma walks backwards it looks to be like building brick Brooks put a little cliffs kind of just in the back trying to help out Elvis then if though it really takes them out of great field position you know growth it's often been said that that football is an oblong shaped object that a very seldom thinks it through pounds but you and I have seen a couple of ballgames this year but the ball is going down about right back to the land well particularly that one that hit him right on a dead run very quick against number 82 is a red team that's what it was hey Brooks thanks to ball back to the 30 take a look at duke bek his responsibility on this play is to jump up in Steve's face passage again and make him fix the ball out hope he gets a little pursuit to help him that timing he did his job second down and 20 to go 45 seconds left third quarter all victory extra freshman from Lubbock Texas is going to get to the other side Davis one straight back sonic is coming in cementing claws Paulette dr. Wade it'll be by Hicks and Senator Brooks at the 5yard line white Hicks compensatory to Georgia the samel or did an outstanding job and he made a great play Brooks really wasn't open he was trying to run right through that zone defense the man who really made the play was gellick he got on Steve before he could really let the plane to bail up and throw the ball over the top and sure need that rush third down and 20 39 seconds to go here in the third quarter Davis is free of five for 63 yards have to complain about well you overlook up to spectate chicken abdomen positive first on Oklahoma just a nice little third 20 right through the middle job but it takes ability to make those things work and culbreth really did the job let's take a look from the end zone you can see looks like a trap in which Cobras might have been caught right at the line of scrimmage when he did frankerz since Michigan had about nine being up in front it was pretty clear sailing he made it just by yard arstan goal ago I'm a ghost about a quarter left Oklahoma look into a long ways what a possible and you might see probable national championship and they can score here loketh went down in a hurry matter of fact he lost about a half a yard and well that's going to be the last play of this the third quarter that's it Wow we'll come back to the arms go to Miami it's a delightful night it's a big game and it's over nothing Oklahoma with 15 minutes to go learning about n\u00fcrnberg he might think is a great demon sustained an hour held a family hit turned to gold a big plane actually resulting in orientation Commodore was talking about his way here in the arts ball talking about defense each of the see tonight's game he should have bought it Tommy know was finally getting into a situation where he's got a scene there might be a contender good Jim he's been a good defensive player with a good defense for long time second down and ten to go for Oklahoma Steve Davis during the football at David David make the 13 or nothing overall on a 10yard run diffic with that pressure on you all night long eventually some kind of give these been running both sides of the line I mentioned he likes to run the ball to the right this seems like a base no difference against a lot of commitment makes an excellent play tippytoes it in the end zone so things are looking good down in Oklahoma on a tear and saw Tony Diaz a column is already off setting up to kick the extra point a whole will be Davis seconds to go in the ballgame at Oklahoma the Bluebird suitors made the low rates of Michigan 14 to

join John Chancellor for one of the most important specials television has ever brought you Monday at 8:00 7:00 central time the Sooners of Oklahoma March 12 plays 68 yards Davis going over from 10 yards out a sporty the nothing come about through there quarter football ago Tony D will kick it off North fell back near his own goal on deep it will be taken by the up and Lydell light or gets out across the 30 yard line and we believe that it will be repeats coming back yet is not yet come on the field now Rick leach does come back in and the Michigan fancy governor's vice concussion just before the end of the first half marquel Singh has been in there since a leech has a big job ahead of himself it's go to the Wolverines Omaha ball looks mighty tough dumping in Johnson water the right Jim Smith cutting inside and gets about four yards to the 35 yard line Jimbo Elrod is over there along with Anthony Bryant of dildo key second down and six seems like most of Michigan's success has been on misdirection plays that's another one that's the third out of four that he's carried that have been pretty good for him however if you to look at the total yards difference it's pretty awesome now with the Oklahoma maintaining the ball is on if they have got Ferdowsi has come in as a receiver for the Michigan Wolverines it's back 40 bill running up field oh my what is exciting runners he gets to the 40yard line and very close to the first job in thirds out of body yard doing so when an Anthony wine able to make the tiger I don't even see a gas going jumping around here when we saw mark to the parade Lance by if she quit about four miles of real working last night yes Jared third down in the yard 42 nothing nothing late earns it himself and has the group down exactly linear objects discovered the field Jim Smith and Rob rival are talking to one another about 40 builders father down the deal and it might be about a marquee assignment somewhere along the way other than any event it's a first down they certainly have a lot of time to get it straight because it didn't affect the play that time I know Lee could just wait to get a good link it didn't come when he spray stuff they finally got it all all of us is we're number one of those only 13 minutes to go you bet there is this game is a long way from over Jim Smith the motion first down at the 35 yard line Leeds was hip way back to Nick junior defensive end from Brookfield Texas came in brownfield Texas and I'm Luke awesome yeah Rick really didn't even have a chance to make a book to bail out of play back in there so fast he he was not intending to have to key on that man however that's the way it worked out that's the loss of love 13 yards second down to 23 back into plank much of that left side tonight local over here at the second half Mike Phillips started spread those blahblahblah for not too much we third down at more than twenty yards to go leading the way with Mark Donohue a sophomore take a look at that Michigan offensive line they have three sophomores and one freshman and they're going up against the Salman brothers of another allamerican by the name of Jim Doyle wrong third and 20 later on a long way to go and it's going to make it if you could stop with the 45 yard line it's morph Donald objectivity it's one of the few times that I've seen Oklahoma go into a previous they did it one time before the half boys they still get a good pass rush John Anderson gunk on the month of all away at Joe Washington go deep after some stepping off his home 31 yard line time to put away is whatever it is going to try to run it back hung up that right side Donegal what about 2100 water food Oklahoma on it that's the second time in the last five minutes there's been a Volvo forward like that it is a flag back at the 23 yard line walk back Terry Peters is down there he's really hurt and he was the one that fell on the pump originally and then what you don't get it clean you have a whole pack of pals willing to help you out left us call I guess go Clah home Sooners lead by 14 we've got nearly 11 minutes to go and that is Jerry Peters along a sideline injured just under that right knee or maybe along the deep ball being stepped off now back inside the 15 back to the 11 yard line where the Sooners have it perfect and equipping I guess I'm her 57 other red team that only call again so be more reserved linebacker on the return Steve Davis has scored from 10 yards out the by at the other cuts down Billy Brooks from 39 yards out tonight Michigan has come posts on some occasions asses in the end zone just to knock away tinker Owens wide left Davis picks it up and running out of Alice's you're watching mark that up the 16 yard line and that will be a gain of five second apart acha stops well what a day of football you have been I'm a newspapers have been full of conjecture what would happen if UCLA upset Ohio State well usually did and we'll find out what happens so way back pull back over walk on from Haven Pennsylvania and bulwark got an outstanding first quarter they play well all evening long the junior of Akron Ohio made the stop and it's third down and Michigan one set the ball back third and five big boys back in it goes wide to the right Steve Davis let's go down by furling earth at its fourth down number 97 death bourlingueur a fiscal Minnesota junior put the pressure on that punting game but they've had several block during the year this would be a very inopportune time for the big red to have one of those things out but you can bet think Rowan's going to get rid of that thing almost as fast as he catches Jim Smith white Hicks 3717 when Safety's in about mithya Owens in his own end zone iPad from Center gets the ball away not very far but it is picked up by Hicks and down he goes dragged down very quickly by number 74 bill table reserved defensive tackle and it'll be first down Oklahoma at the 43 of Michigan but line 28 to go in the game Sooners 14 Wolverines mother had a great time it was a nice reward with a hard season that we did put in now you heard the words of Franco Harris you will be able to see Franco Harris at 1:00 o'clock Eastern times on the afternoon of the AFC Championship game from Pittsburgh Oakland against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the course Franco Harris is the big man for them one of that games goes off of the Super Bowl but the 43 brick leach is it their party Bell trying to get something going Solman do we trailed him all the way he's picked up about four to five yards inside the 40 after his Sulman trailing on the play along with Cindy brown faith aside he made most of those five on it though that seems like every time they get wide and things look like they're about to open up five or six people are converging on it and that's possibly why the misdirection plays of work dice I do have a feeling they're going to have to put the ball up some Jim I know they don't like to but looks like about that time in the game wait Leroy and Dewey Selman anthony bryan at Jimbo Elrod that one five for Oklahoma air is going out breaking into the secondary it has the first down down near the 32 yard line and around that man and around that fall again is Leroy so yeah those who say that when it comes to the National Football League Raftis assemble the absolutely the number 1 victim Tampa Bay they have the first pick gene Johnson 88 comes in a freshman from Flint bring cleats territory meet Johnson left here comes Jim step deploy at the 36 yard line and he you know he was looking for it as soon as Smith took a step Elrod went right along with him that is generally not his responsibility but they had to find a way to stop it somehow let's take a look at Smith we take a look at our and our screen we're going to see all right coming in right behind it makes a great play there's nobody responsible to block that man I woke up all the Front's of the Elrod's in Tulsa whereas from throughout the state base you can overlap a few second down and 14 to go and leaks gonna try to complete one here throwing it down and way out of Alves across the plate done in 14 Johnson number 27 the ball never had a chance he was trying to hit Keith going right down the sideline any movement to stop the head it was well covered by Zach Anderson and Hicks also but generally when Michigan is throwing the ball they've thrown it with one man coming out then they're picking them up pretty tough George Stephenson comes in Prescott seen comes up Stephenson listed as a split end 7:40 to go Oklahoma leading by 14 Jim Smith Hugh Johnson both go wide left leach as the time delivers and it is over the head of everybody and Jennifer Keith Johnson downfield at the 5yard line Mike Henderson was there with it now it is fourth down and 7 34 to go leach looks to the sidelines see do we try Mort again on fourth down and 14 to go what do we kick it away time is getting a little short but they're going to punt hope they get a good a good break and a turnover that's the way they've been doing it for years I guess I'm no one to set get that Michigan the fewest points they've had this year 14 but they have none so far tonight down by Lytle and Oklahoma is back in the hole again they've got that play down 725 to go in the game and we go down memory lane with another former participant in a previous Orange Bowl Lawrence Bowl Classic is one of our long remember because it was the last game that I coaches the college football coach and it was a memorable one one than all the coaching staff the football players and the University of Notre Dame alumni will long remember because of our victory we pause briefly for station identification this is the NBC television network got everyone evel knievel thought he was something yeah but he only pasted wood wall is on the two yard line Oklahoma has it and has the 14 to nothing lead Billy Brooks goes wide to the right but you can bet Steve Davis is going to put it in the air from here go Washington in the end zone try to get out of the end zone oh yeah that's the one oh that would have been two points Michigan would have got the ball on a free kick from the 20 well I tell you Joe was put to the test on that one and he was up to it he is definitely alone what's his ball is snapped now you can see Duke Beck is playing the whole thing out to stop Joe that's been his assignment all night long Calvin O'Neal almost got a shot at him and those are two pretty good cats running you down if Vic is right I'm out about second at 11:00 all the time left 717 what ball is loose oh my wait for the official that's Michigan now they say Mexican has got the ball on the food okayif they seem to both seems to know what he's doing out there no way in the world how to put it on fourth down and ten on a 35yard line he plays it just right gets the ball picked up on a oneyard line now culbreth fumbles they've got the ball a chance to get back in the game second fumble tonight for Jim Cobra and this one is on the 2 yard line while Michigan had a couple of opportunities Washington could have been thrown from the same team but they'd rather have this first and goal to go from the two at 7:09 left in the game forty bell pepper how many of these kind of see before at a loss to yard down by that goal line and snack for today's most stones on his own now we'll see which way they're going to go whether they going to go for the two or the one I would assume that I don't know I think in a way I think they're going for the two because if they don't make it they still got an opportunity the next time to go value to dye it rather put too much of a burden on it to make two points if they get closed up on the next touchdown that's assuming an awful lot protects away the Bob woods got in there they're lined up so they are going to go for the two lead follow the interference and leak is stopped short and it's four people six seven oh six to go take a look at least taking the hands off to title into himself looks like they have a chance however he's running into a big wall is doing Selma there who makes the play keep it short well I'm going to hold off the old brownie statement I've heard so many times these last couple of years the game is still in the Hat it's back in the Hat oh it looks like peaches hurt again lates concussion the first time now it looks like it could be one of his legs and it could be up to marquel's ago in 1947 Miami gets hauled across ten passes were thrown by Miami and they completed none Michigan is now over 13 but that record won't mean a thing to them if they can come back and tie or win this ballgame Oklahoma with Ohio State having lost a day as shot at the national championship Arizona State sitting down there and Tempe wandering out the votes will go after all this is over and UCLA feeling pretty good after what they did today onside kick open a football and it belongs to Oklahoma out of the 46 yard line from seven oh dude ago they went for the onside kick allows to Oklahoma now market at the 47 now the Michigan defense will be tested they have not been able to stop Oklahoma on the long drives but certainly did an excellent job at Oklahoma at the ball first out on their own two that's Joe Washington Washington he'll do a yard or two by Michael number forty it'll be second down and long yardage even looks good just getting back to the line of scrimmage there's Rick leach they're working on him again Dickens second down and about nine go mark LZ goes back to the well again warming up as the a super punch of the third quarter what elites was up with that slight concussion take your own steps left as your Washington Washington's got the first down and he's inside the 45 down to the 43 yard line of the University of Michigan Zach was made down there by Derrick Howard and Jim Pickens then if you can include somebody right off the line and the identifying job is better all year long with that with a very critical play because they have to keep possession of that ball keep it away from Michigan that's the best way to do it just pick up those first sounds and I thought they had a first off if they're going to measure apparently and it brought out the stick yet here they come and they've got the first down 643 are left Oklahoma 14 Michigan six Oklahoma scored on a 68 yard drive with Davis the model 10 yards and part of that after a stand against by dick Irwin's believe woods ran 39 yards the Lord Michigan touchdown set up with Cobra fumbled on the 2 at Michigan took it in first down from the 43 Steve Davis and a lot of folks over there aren't there sitting just purling her number 97 who made the stop at its second out of nearly 10 and you can see Davis used his head again their times running a little short with six and a half minutes to go he did everything he could to make sure he stayed inbounds once he couldn't pick up any more yardage you Billy Sims is now in for the first series of downs he replaces peacock and now sins goes out and peacock has come back in Owens comes wide left look at that Washington's broken that record here comes peacock gamma is there an abalone obey the play and suddenly the third down and after that loss it'll be about 30 years ago the big part is they did get him out of bounds let's take a look at Joe Washington in another dimension the guys with great running back we he's also an excellent blocker they feel like he's contributed as much walking as he asked running for him all year long this time he thinks to him back and just put him right on his dumped allamerican again zone American that's on the edge but to wash third down up 13 to go straight ahead goes to pulled October woman Kenny Adams for the 42 yard line and Oklahoma will have to kick it away and with about 5:45 to go less than that but nothing kick it away Michigan left one more shot at least one more dicker oh I'm stepping back it was old 38 wide Hicks is the deep man crushes all he got it away thought is going down toward the end zone and into the end zone then we'll come up with the 20 yard line tried to make a little relay job and that was really all 550 to go the ball comes out to the 20yard line Michigan threading 1406 but are we magically I literally just had my 16th birthday and that's a very heady experience for one so young I don't think opening the government so young maybe five people a year in the arms goal of a nice evening temperature in the mid sixties in Simpson John Brodie Michigan's got the football setting Keith Johnson wide to the left lzj is the quarterback quickly to get on the bench with an injury now they go back to throw off first down gets the ball away and over to intended receiver Jim Smith at the 38 yard loss gonna be second down at them and now Michigan is over more Deena now Marc Helsing is limping a little bit well he's limping because Jimbo Elrod had a beautiful shot at it took it just as he threw the ball and that's why I wasn't throwing a little high looked like he got it right in the thigh but yeah that's awful hard to throw when you're catching a defensive lineman at the same time you're trying to pick out a receiver they look to the sidelines but Helsing is staying in there second optin rate ahead and suddenly it has turned out an L thing is still limping looking back to the sideline and he knows he's going to have to put it up if you can find a way to live back there it shouldn't restrict is throwing too much and it's often necessary they do complete their first ball of the night with under five minutes to play if they're going to get back on a playability is coming in with gene Johnson Jim Smith lot of the right Pete Johnson wide to the left Marty Mel and he's not going to get anywhere near the first out of the border 25yard line no he's dominant there Michigan's Florida backing has taken the bluffs tonight Rick lead church twice helsing and limping off and Oklahoma looking stronger every moment John Anderson comes on to kick the ball away block shows exactly four minutes left Thomas called by Oklahoma apparently and they're calling Oklahoma's Jamie Thomas over I think they want to get everything straight valo Xenia ball the first professional appearance for this past season counted football seniors we televised by NBC from mobile on Obama's gonna get one foot Eastern Time on Sunday January 11 among the players you'll see are all Americans break 10 rows of San Diego State at jeans quick to Toledo the two top college masses in the country that's the Senior Bowl Sunday January 11th 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time right here on NBC NBC Sports number one alive covered two major sports events all year round and you don't believe me remember that today I hope you saw on NBC number one ranked Ohio State upset by UCLA and now for the first time on television at better than two years you're seeing Oklahoma make a run or what they hope will be the national championship Anderson in to kick the ball away Anderson gets away at woody Beauty Joe Washington deep and takes it at the 30yard line Oklahoma's got the football and time is in their favor they're up by 8 with 352 to go Anderson has done an outstanding job of punting the ball tonight he's not standing punter and that they have a big edge in that department it's a good thing that ball game hasn't gone down to that as far as Oklahoma's concern give our historical facts about the arms Bowl down its 42nd year that I Brooks lied to the right that's Cobra getting away from Portman gets up near the 40 yard line and near another first down and be second down and short yardage about 2x came up from his samely position to make the stop you know culbreth hasn't made a whole lot this year Jim and it's good to see has fumbled the ball twice and when he has carried the ball he's carried him for a lot of yardage in between Joe Washington turning the corner has got the first down they'll mark the ball at the 42 yard line first first and 10 for the Sooners no Washington was allamerican as a sophomore small in arcanist Yunior not as a senior but then he did have the statistics even in the big 8 because of the way they ran the wishbone and even more than that how they defense the wishbone which was the fencing that left halfback and yet very swiftly said he think he contributed as much this year if he had the previous to there he goes go Washington cutting in sorrow still on his way for what a move and body back down by 7 first down inside the 45 I don't know if he has any eyes in his ear holes but it certainly appears so because there's no way he can make the moves he does to the right to the left is laterally as he does without just a little bit of edge on the rest of it he seems easy and things know if it's don't get a chance to see I believe less than three minutes to go first down Ava's hands off the Cobra and covers gets down on the 40yard line what a day this has been for collegiate football then we're getting to the time when they need one or two real big plays and if they're to get another first down it's going to make it awful tough for Michigan to even get the ball back and in order to do that they'd have to call all their timeout Ellie Brooks goes law to the right second down on the body Nev Davis Lawson 3550 back the peacock down goes an official addictive is exquisite and Steve isn't very happy about the way just executed that play they had a shot we picked up seven or eight yards possibly could have picked up the first down he chose to throw it off the peacock and actually a Michigan man hit it in the inner of us and even he knew that with the chance he didn't want to take it this time let's let's take a look at he makes the call Brent he comes on out here he turns up the field makes pretty good play see here whoops well the guy that got in the interim was the referee that could have been a very big exchange and Steve Davis said a few words about he may have been out of thrift fact I know he was Wallace old Vacaville let's take a procedure against number 66 of the red team Terry Webb the allamerican Muskogee Oklahoma the only of illegal motion second down at about 13 to 18 left Michigan hoping for the big turnover Oklahoma just wanting to move the football and run down the clock oh look at Joe Washington he went into the line and all of a sudden like he backed out of there that's what they said he could run backwards just as fast as you can run a horde design I know it sure makes you look like a good coach though if you have one like this around here he goes into the line makes an excellent sidestep on Devin gets outside of pearling er and with one step you does the whole routine picks up about seven or eight yards and they're back in position to make another first down third down and five to go Brooks very wide to the right Howie I can tell it's back to Joe Washington converging on him and it's going to be fourth down as he loses about five yards and Michigan will get yet another shot with two minutes to go and counted inside the tomb of the five and Oklahoma naturally and no hurry at all to get the kicking team off you can see those two guys walking off the field both O'Neal and Gordon played a heck of a game all night long they've been in pursuit when you play against that wishbone you better be running 1:43 left that's here before Queen rushes on ticker Oh instead he gets the ball away and this ball will go into the end zone and come back down to the point they touch the ball of the 7yard line apparently which will down up there so don't give them the ball on the 20 give it to him on the 7th Lee over was down well on Sunday February the 15th NBC sports premieres WC G's challenge come from Hawaii what a place on on having new concept the world of professional tennis featuring eight of the world's greatest competitors in a

you know that Rick reaches in there they've got 93 yards to go and then they must get the 22 tie late turns it upfield across the pan and leeches out across the 15 yard line well our thanks to Jim Armstrong the president of the Orange Bowl committee Dan McNamara the general manager al Fleming the production manager Gil Sloane the publicity director the Orange Bowl committee old friends Ben Ben Smith Jack moments north continent all of the members have worked so hard all year long to make this event possible second down in the body yard if you do have their timeouts left in but they're going to have to use one in the second 59 seconds left they haven't completed a pass yet Lee puts it up and cannot complete this one intended for key jumps I'll selectively about everybody that we're deeply indebted to the man who started all of these pageants Ernie Siler who retired after last year and of course from Michigan Academy athletic director ocean back to the head coach will attempt carry the sports information office Oklahoma Wade Walker the athletic director Barry Switzer the head coach John Keith the sports information director once this game is over if it ends this way those who vote will go back to the old drawing board is an Oklahoma number one is it Arizona State number one who's number one that's up to them to the sign but I would say that Oklahoma's got a big long leg up on the possibilities he sent off 240 Bell who gets off to the seven yard line clock continues to run Anthony Bryan number 71 makes the spout the possibility as we call timeout for Oklahoma to win the national championship was set up the day when Ohio State was beaten by UCLA I'm sure down in Alabama where they only lost their first game of the season whatever game since the Crimson Tide followers is hey hey what about us down here I think there's a lot of people going to be putting a claim in but this group tonight looks like they've got about excited that's not a chance as anybody I've seen they think so they're awesome I mean they've got six and seven balanced just have the kind of ability you can't teach and they are very well disciplined they're very well thought that these guys seem to have it all when you find a team that throws less than they do and when they do throw they throw as effectively you've got quite a group Steve Davis very effective as a Florida knight his long pass to Tinker Oh and set up the first touchdown run by Billy Boy but our cleats will try to get Michigan back into the ball game should they negotiate these final 82 yards in the 49 seconds remaining they still have to go for the two points in order to tie if they think that at this stage beat Johnson wide to the left Kirk Stephenson wad to the right instant blank to the left first down leach under pressure and down he goes clock continues to run now they call tie with 42 seconds left an outstanding pageant here tonight and an outstanding display of football here tonight a reminder that Saturday afternoon got Notre Dame and UCLA playing the game of basketball and on Sunday afternoon the right to go to the Super Bowl the open Raiders of the Pittsburgh Steelers right now the folks from Oklahoma are concerned about one thing the final 42 seconds Barry Switzer look at this this is before tonight 31 1 &amp; 1 octonal Bowl before can you imagine being 31 1 and 1 and Steve Davis's quarterback this to that and not having been under Bowl well they're in one tonight they doing quite a job more than 80,000 looking on Bo Schembechler and his Michigan prove done an outstanding job they never moved the ball in close without some outstanding possibilities with their passing game early in the ballgame Oklahoma kept the pressure on the lyrics ran those 39 yards with five minutes to go in the first half third quarter was scoreless but Oklahoma is moving the football and on the first play of the fourth quarter culminating a 68 yard drive Steve Davis took it in the thumb of I cope with set up bills to yard touchdown for Michigan about seven minutes ago and sportiness a leech second down has to put it up Ellis to waited long to Gordie Bell Bell nifty running our hosta 30 yard line to the 34 on half a minute to go and I'm called for the moment because they stopped the clock on a first down in collegiate football this is where you can tell Jim just how well a team is drilled to play in this pain in this last minute of a ballgame they have no seconds to lose they've only got 27 left late doesn't know where to unload it and doesn't load it to keep Johnson that's another first down which will stop the clock with 20 seconds to go at the 49 all I want to do now is get one more completion down to the 30 so they'd have a chance to put four balls up into the end zone that has the best shot they have from their own 49yard line leads back to throw again excellent protection drills the ball in complete stops the clock intended there for Jim Smith at the 43 Scott Hill defending 12 seconds left and what seemed like moments ago as your shot for Oklahoma still looks pretty good but they're getting a little scare for their money well I'd say it's you know right now Michigan's in a situation where they have to get the ball about twenty twentyfive yards down the field and then they'll only have a chance for one more play because with 12 seconds left it's going to take that long to execute anything that's going to get the ball down the field one more chance they'd love to have it Les Miles replaces mark Donahue from Michigan at left offensive guard well at his second down death 14 to 6 Oklahoma at 12 seconds to go and let's change that around fiveyard penalty here nearly the delay to get the white team leather game we've been thanking everybody we should thank Pete Williams of the fine set of officials here to us alright Smith then Johnson to the right but Stevenson to the left Gary Reis another defensive back is coming for Oklahoma under pressure he throws for Smith and the ball is almost intercepted by Jerry Reese who just came into the ball game Reese made a fine flake and that ball was right on the money under a big rush they've been trying to get in fifth all night and look like they finally had him but he came up with a final the Oklahoma pride of Oklahoma BAM thinks they've got it there's only time for one more play and got to be 57 yards Michigan playing for the first time in a bowl game that is not the Rose Bowl Oklahoma knock off probation taking a shot at the national title third down five seconds to go leads back to throw these puts it up and it is intercepted down the field by scott hill time has run off as Hill goes down Oklahoma has won 14 of 6 they'll be voting in the coming week to see who is the national champion Barry Switzer's group did an outstanding job with Delhi folks and Steve Davis scoring the touchdowns one runs of 39 and 10 yards and the bubble set up the gordy Bell 2yard touchdown verse tonight Oklahoma well I put one of the words you use John boutt\u00e9 awesome",

Regis a world leader in paper packaging and lumber products Happy New Year everybody Curt Goudy here in Aldi real got us for NBC and we have a gorgeous afternoon for the 1975 Rose Bowl game been very windy out here the last two days but the winds are subsided we have a bright sunshine crisp weather and now I'd call it almost a perfect day for football it's absolutely perfect for running the football and for throwing it two of the stars of course Herald it in the pregame buildup the two men who finished one and two and the Heisman Trophy winners and L talked to him earlier of America's great athletes Anthony Davis will be wearing 28 USC parts Griffin will be wearing 45 Ohio State both allamericans the Heisman Trophy winner here on my left the runnerup on my far left both have exceeded a thousand yards in rushing the three years in each of the years that they were at their respective schools and as I say playing in their third Rose Bowl but Anthony for you as a senior must have special meaning and arts you're one of the few people that's in a position to ever have played assuming next year the big one also in for what is the Rose Bowl antha mean particularly it's just a classical thing for me and I've always look forward to stuff like they seem awful kid I thought of playing roles really when I see the Simpsons and Jimmy generals stuff in this sword from art school it's always a feat thing you saw how it stayed because their classical team runners like Archie and the former players to play with go 20 hayes and it's always a great feat playing something like this somebody this is what you woke up for all season this is what magazine June July and August you know working out for it that's some about us what it all turns out to be the rules lore that's what you're working for to come to the rolls well we know you two fellows have been together so much lately and you've gotten to be pretty good friends is there any kind of strategy discussion that maybe I'd like to have right now not on me I really don't like it into the clink about football and how they talk about it we do run some offenses we run the high off tackle sweet blast and my coaches stated adopt my best play our formations off tackle you know I think it's the blast I like I like I asked Archie what was the best place for him but not for me a little best played I like to run is off tackle and I figured you know that's what our block it is where those tackles are so I i'd rather than then you can't do that I'm different offices would not go hey I heard that you took your offensive line out to dinner is that right yeah I did so happily you know I had a little money in the savings and uh you know I got a pretty good thing at la raz\u00f3n we and we have the beef bowl and then our ticket and I feel that you know it's taking more office while I was with something specially because those are guys who don't really get the credit because if they don't score or an aqua blue hopefully thought to myself oh we can't we can't run well alright this is the rubber match it's was 4217 two years ago 4221 who folks came back and won it last year it's Anthony's finale you've got another shot at it it's the Rose Bowl and it is the big one how do you feel better well this I feel is gonna be a really great game this is supposed to be the best game of three years I'm sure you know there's gonna be a great clash it's gonna be a lot of hitting in there I'm sure and I think you know it'll be hard for me to gain and I'm sure I'm sure defense is gonna be ready too just like family to great football players it's gonna be a great Rose Bowl we'll be back with more Rose Bowl preview in just a moment let's look into the tree one of America's most important raw materials it's made up of hardwood SAP wood bark and a microscopically thin layer of the cambium but how wisely is it being used st. Regis is out to use every bit of it we use the sawdust and bark for fuel to generate electricity we're working on ways to use the branches and the stumps in fact we even use the pine scent it's the chemical component of the wood as a worldwide leader in packaging this is just one of the many ways st. Regis is working to increase America's supply of available wood so we can keep up with the demand for our wood based packaging materials like these boxes cartons and bags without asking nature to give us more than she can and that's why we at st. we just say we're serving man and nature to the benefit of both two great players two super teams and two great coaches and earlier this week Kurt Goudy had a chance to talk to a really great one this segment of our Rose Bowl pregame show is our custom usually to have the two head coaches we hope to have john mckay today but as we film the show john had the flu Ilyn bed couldn't be here where was of course Woody Hayes winding up 24 years head coach at Ohio State his 7th Rose Bowl appearance right now I think the most talked about controversial may be football coach of all time he looks right on you everybody says what a bad guy you are then are the right stories what a great guy you are how do you react to all this controversial squirrels around it it worries me very little you'd be surprised I just don't bother to think about it or if they write some things I don't want to read why just don't read them you went to the season after suffering a heart attack today did you change your regime any this year no no I couldn't change I took six weeks as the doctors felt I should to rest and then after that I'm going right back to work and I've done exactly the same maybe work a little harder just to prove I can do it you've been quoted woody that this may be the greatest college team of all time at your coaching that you bring into the Rose Bowl you would really believe that I don't know it hasn't been yet it almost was during the middle of the season it would score maybe eight times in a row all teams just don't do that and we do have versatility that we have not had before now last year at times our defense carried our offense this year for the most of the year that's been the other way around but we think their defense is getting more healthy than they were any time this year and we think they can give a good accountability of themselves you've also been quoted that John Mackay is the most innovative college coach in America well I only say that because I have to play my lips off top but really I do think he is I think the I formation in these come in with that gives you the opportunity of using the great talents of a great back to hit any hole on the line and then if you've got a good quarterback to tie it up with in which that tailbacks getting the ball then again he isn't any quarterbacks coming rolling out there with good speed it gives you a real onetwo punch and John Mackay is really the man who developed this system along with men in motion which we did years ago but he used them for a different purpose than we used in years ago and he feel that he has done the most in college football of any single coach there are right now four distinct systems of college offenses but even with those four each coach who takes on one of them puts his own little ideas into them and we take a lot of things from John McCain but when I went into the I formation I made sure one thing that I had a good quarterback as well as a good tailback Woody Hayes the head coach of Ohio State and amidst all the controversy about woody you want to really go find out something about him go to his players who were played for him after they get out of school they're his biggest boosters we'll have more after this hundreds of miles out in space a NASA satellite makes infrared images and st. Regis was there what's a paper company doing with outer space technology learning to spot sick trees like this one with infrared imagery we hope to identify diseased trees or insect infested ones much sooner using this infrared technology we think we'll be able to save wood that often went to waste before as a worldwide leader in packaging this is just one of the many ways st. Regis is working to increase America supply of available wood so we can keep up with the demand for our wood based packaging materials like these boxes cartons and bags without asking nature to give us more than she can and that's why we at st. we just say we're serving man and nature to the benefit of both hovering behind us not in the booth but on chromakey is the NBC telephones in the background I'll never forget out the first time I ever walked into this Rose Bowl eight years ago took a sight at this mammoth Stadium one hundred and six thousand people the surrounding countryside and every New Year's Day has been a beautiful day like this it is one of the most imposing sights in sports caring every year that I'm here with you I get that same feeling over and over and we've also been amazed this year that the city of roses of course Pasadena is active 365 days a year but I've been amazed at the multimillion dollar conference Exhibition Center there's now part of Pasadena skyline and this city has really been on the move thousands of people roses parade which has been held since 1890 and this Rose Bowl stadium you're looking at now the first Rose Bowl game played in this Stadium for January 1st 1923 today there will probably be a hundred and seven thousand people here capacity is 104 seven but they'll squeeze a hundred and seven in here today we'll have more of a look at the Rose Bowl game right after this message you're now entering America's most unique State Forest a grove of Bach's huckleberry that has been set aside in Pennsylvania and even though it's over a thousand years old it's only three inches high but on our seedling nurseries we're developing superior trees to grow as fast as possible nature can afford to wait thousands of years for plants to grow inches America can't especially in our commercial forests we're even finding trees like the one on the left that grow up to 50 percent faster in certain areas than the one in the middle as the worldwide leader in packaging this is just one of the many ways st. Regis is working to increase America's supply of available wood so we can keep up with the demand for our wood based packaging materials like these boxes cartons and bags without asking nature to give us more than she can and that's why we at st. Regis say we're serving man and nature to the benefit of both ladies and gentlemen the Watergate jury is meeting right now and we may have the verdict of that trial as soon as we have it will switch to Washington DC and do an NBC News correspondent for a second report making reports we have USC this year off to a stumbling start losing its opening game they tied another game that while that with nine victory the loss of his die Ohio State upset by Michigan State their only loss certainly out two of the top four teams in America the winner of this game depending on what happens tonight in the Orange Bowl might merge you the national town how rare it is Curt to see so many seniors coming back to play in another Rose Bowl game this should be a very highscoring affair I think it's going to be one of the most exciting Rose Bowls of all time now certainly on paper they have the matchups and that's it right now as we've taken a look at the Rose Bowl the USC band is on the field and this look at the 1975 Rose Bowl game has been brought to you by st.

of all the USC Trojans who wound up the seasons in a plane averaging 41 points a game in their last four game they were off to a stumbling start but their defense was capable all year they averaged their opponents only 11 points a game and that's all America and over back Charles Phillips number 49 he picked three fumbles out of there and ran him back for touchdown a threetime allamerican the first for US v as they're lying back a Richard wood they'll be number 83 quarterback Pat Haden a recent winner of a road scholarship there's the plate of 239 passes of the career that's his buddy JK McKay they've been a battery since high school day Haden is throwing 31 touchdown passes for the Trojans four big ones against Notre Dame there's McKay grabbing in the end zone the last regular game of the season Allen Carter maybe the best reserve tailback in the country you'll be number 21 he runs a hundred and nine for average at five and a half yards of carry but the Trojan offense is led by this man number Anthony Davis the Pacific eights alltime touchdown leader he broke OJ Simpson single game rushing record touchdown returns on kickoff he's been the best set an NCAA record six double time return the kickoffs in three years three of them against Notre Dame and here he is against Notre Dame running that touchdown back to open the second half for a hundred and two yard he'll be a marked man with Ohio State kicks off today very gently now Anthony let's take a look down at the Ohio State Buckeye over on the left side as a linebacker will be Bruce Elia number 36 he was a fullback last year and this year he led the Buckeyes and tackle T they have an allamerican in 88 named van decree and allamerican tackle number 71 named Pete juicy and also an allamerican in the secondary Neal cozy number 20 Tom Flavin's for field goes three of them over 40 yards get Ohio State into the Rose ball game against Michigan Ohio State uh superb running backs this man is a freshman last year Pete Johnson scored three touchdowns he'll probably start today the Buckeyes ran for over 4,000 yards in 11 games running has always been a hallmark of Woody Hayes team this is the wing back Brian Bosch Nagle who's the most versatile player on the team and also it's best pass receiver champ Henson has scored a touchdown every nine times he's carried the ball in college he'll be number 38 he once carried 44 times in a game a typical Ohio State bruising fullback the most valuable player in this game last year was a sophomore number 7 Cornelius green the quarterback I think it'll be decided by the quarterback today Pat Haden and Cornelius green garlic's footballs Player of the Year with Archie Griffin he's only five nine 180 you've never stopped the first time you hit him marvelous balance and continues to break tackles the fifth junior ever to capture the Heisman Trophy he's gained at least 100 yards rushing in each of his last 22 games that's an alltime college record a runner without standing balance Woody Hayes said he's the best player he's ever coached in 24 years at Ohio State and the most popular player he's ever tutored and here's the Queen robbing car 18 years old she's quite a talker and we were at the press luncheon the other day she does a Martha Mitchell of those pretty very lovely well two years ago USC beat Ohio State storing 42 points last year Ohio State scored 42 points on the Trojan you look for a highscoring game this year world famous Ohio State marching back the two teams in the locker room they'll be ready to come out from the opening kickoff

holding the opponent's scoreless it was almost awesome and a ladies and gentlemen our national anthem we pause briefly for station identification this is the NBC television network well both teams are

this way and we hear from Washington there's apparently a verdict in a Watergate trial we'll return to the Rose Bowl in the opening kickoff following this report from the federal courthouse in Washington and NBC News correspondent Caryl Stern they're gonna hold a kickoff oh good good dick how long will they take what are you gonna do every game we do there's something going on and do some where they got away from they emitted Ohio State has won the toss will recede on your left W in the white USC in the cardinal dark jerseys will kick off from your right and to colleges rich in football tradition and winning tradition collide again in the Rose Bowl the referee today charlie masters from Seattle he's a corporate director of personnel the Boeing Company Rusk emperor of Cincinnati is an executive kemper sons incorporated J's settle of Cypress California is the headlines when he's at deputy superintendent of school in Huntington Beach California Richard Waller House of Ann Arbor Michigan the line judge he's a construction company owner the back judge is Marv Tom Rebecca of Tacoma Washington he's a fuel oil distributor the field judge is George slappy of Edina Michigan he's a district manager of Insurance and as usual we see it in the colleges and the pros these officials get paid but they're really doing it for love of football it's a hobby dawn Lima halo Chris Lima hey lieu of cabina California will kick off 61 year old Woody Hayes who said he hasn't slowed down a bit after a heart attack last year back in the Rose Bowl again gets his team out of there one man to watch on this kickoff return and there probably been trying to kick away from him let me Lynn Willis the fastest player to ever play in an Ohio State uniform he'll be number 89 he runs a hundred and nine he's run to back this year for 97 yards against Oregon State at 93 yards against Northwestern and Junior College he ran seven kickoffs in a row back for touchdown there he is Lenny Willis he's deep Archie Griffin's of the 10yard line of the far side Ryan Bosch Nagle on the 10yard line on the near side that's Griffith here we go one of the top matchups of all time in the Rose Bowl it's a kick coming to Willis he has it on the sex bubbles of all he's in trouble right now and he's buried under sound field is David Lewis and outside reserve linebacker San Diego a soft board are knocking down in the 5yard line Ohio State's ball first down Cornelius green is the quarterback number seven the fullback will be a sophomore Pete Johnson green the junior Archie Griffin's at tailback 45 a junior Bosch Nagle is 48 a junior this backfield will return intact next year duck France 80 is the tide in will get the split in for you just a minute I think it's Willis here the first time play and they go for the fullback Pete Johnson he's to the 8 yard line he's hit by art Riley that offensive right tackle for USC hazel has started at number 82 Kurt Schumacher's at left tackle 72 pitch Smith's at left guard number 60 dick Mac the brother of Tom Mac for the Rams of the center 69 Steve Myers playing with a broken wrist at the right guard 52 and Scott Natalie 73 is the right tackle second down seven the pitch out is the dress 10 down in the 11 yard line Riley allamerican linebacker Richard wood number 83 it'll be third down and 4 for Ohio State third down three to go for Ohio State Griffin is back short of the first down my art Riley again USC uses a threeman front of Jeter 79 at left tackle both of Bradley 92 the nose guard and Riley 70 the right tackle the two men standing up on the line are really linebackers Mitchell 85 on the left and on the right at Powell 87 in punt formation is Tom schooled a knee the leading punter in America average 45 yards he didn't have enough punch to qualify for the flooding championship but he had the best average a beautiful kick driving Marvin Cobb back to his 35 Bob is coming out trying to get outside to the 40 and he's down on the 46 yard line I think the flag has dropped not sure it may have been something rolled along the field dick Mac the center went down field it was a penalty flag and this is going to be a clipping against USC school Danny really laid the foot into that one and you can see why he's the best punter in the history of Ohio State you can see why it's allamerican it can also see where there might be a significant advantage between the two punters field position all right the USC backfield Pat Haden will be a quarterback the fullback will be Dave farmer starting ahead of Ricky Bell and the tailback farmer will be number 15 and the tailback will be Anthony Davis number 28 Sheldon Diggs is one outside receiver he's 26 McKay is the other 25 obradovich of the tide in 89 Aidan on the first play to Davis Davis has stacked up on a 27 yard line of USC Arne Jones the middle linebacker in there fourman front for Ohio State Vann decree will play the open side of the field the wide side he's 88 Nick Bonamici 75 of the left tackle Pete Kuzak 71 is the right tackle playing the short the close side of the field add in is Jim Koch 91 a very underrated player he'll use a left linebacker Arnie Jones in the middle and Ken Thompson's on the right number nine ricky bells now in at fullback second roommate for the trojans in motion go Sheldon Diggs a flank eight will put it up he throws it out to dick and it's too high for him third and eight for the Trojans playing at halfback on the open side for Ohio State is Cole Z number 20 on that same side of him deep safety is Tim Fox number 12 duck plank will be number 28 and number 46 is deep Luke actually the way this Ohio State defense finally deploys itself it's almost identical to us see Arnie Jones moves head up on the nose guard it could become a fiveman line or a three they're looking like they want USC to run straight ahead and not wide third and eight it's a draw play after the 30th beautifully the 44 van decreed made the stop on rich parson healthy now there is a perfect play and super execution the two tackles are playing it fly Hayden very prudently hands it off the outside brush you take the linebacker and you've got a big gainer excellent call 17 yards for Anthony Davis notice where the white ball is right now or the balls on the white is very difficult to see that might confuse them on some past patterns playing running over that flag painted on the field Davis to the 50 yard line right now he's not gaining Archie Griffin Pete Kuzak 71 tripped him up from Lakewood Ohio Davis averaged 123 yards a game this year Archie Griffin averaged 147 yards a game Davis without gain but in total yardage Davis was the leader and kickoff returns and when you put everything together good man to watch Curt number 36 Bruce illya fullback last year excellent linebacker two wide receivers way out of the picture at the bottom of your screen now to pitch it to Davis he's at the 50 then Ohio State Territory to the Ohio State 45 and he appears to have a first down he's tackled by Steve Luke from Massillon Ohio the closed side half back but right now it's USC moving on the ground against Ohio State Ohio State has not been as good defensively this year as last year last year Ohio State shut out four opponents this year the defense did not record a shutout no score 10:50 to play in the first period USC on the March here at the Ohio State 45 a slot left formation the fullback running the ball and that's Rickey Bell the Ohio State 33 and another first town all right there it is again they're trying again to cut off Anthony Davis ride Hayden very wisely takes and slow back straight at him if you get the nose guard if you get the middle linebacker you've got a big gain a man decree making the tackle long weekend q and John McKay continues to alternate fullbacks Bell goes out a junior Dave farmer comes in you'll be number 15 Davis of the tailback a slot right coming in motion now his dicks they give it to Anthony Davis he jitterbug he's waiting the 30 25 and he hasn't burned down richard Parsons tackled him at the Ohio State 23 he doesn't have a first down he's very close grayhaired John McKay the quip stir of college coaching now they look to that far sideline we may have a measurement that's the star so far Anthony Davis actually cured Hayden maybe thinking he doesn't really want the first down second and short puts you in a great position Anthony Davis already has gained 40 yards in this game and we have 10 minutes to play in the first period 10 Q number 54 now has gone in at the open side line backing position the place of Bruce edia second down and minutes to go and it's going to be a pass the arch of the deep to McKay and it is intercepted by Neal cold age holds the interception ian's oh that's why he was unanimous defensive allamerican this year from Miami Florida Neal told me surprising thing there is that head Hayden went to the most logical receiver and against the allamerican Neil numbers winning cold lately Ohio State now will go on the offense and will tell you here at the Rose Bowl the score USC nothing Ohio State there are a lot of cars on the road today and even though we're all doing everything we can to conserve gasoline we're still going to need a lot of it and that's going to mean drilling a lot of oil wells at Texaco we're doing exactly that from new wells right here in this country we expect to get enough crude oil to make over 500 million gallons of gasoline enough to help keep half a million cars rolling for a whole year to do this in 1974 alone we drilled over 1,600 new wells that means complete an average of more than three wells a day at Texaco we're working to keep your trust the USC had moved from their 25yard line to the 33 yard line of Ohio State on the ground and now how state has a ball on the interception hazel is the wide receiver right Johnson the fullback in front of Archie Griffin Griffin has the ball no fires been contained he gets a couple or three at the most both the Bradley the nose guard 92 and aren't Riley the right tackle stopping would Bruce are the inside linebackers Marvin pop and Charlie Phillips are the deep man Phillips as the rover Ron Bush is the right cornerback number 23 and Danny Reese the left cornerback 46 Len Willis has replaced hazel as a there's a fake and that bash Nagle running in tenth reverse fashion angle average 10 yards of carry this year is the most versatile player on his team Brian Bosch Nagle another one of those juniors who has a chance to be in for Rose Bowls good fake this is the kind of thing we're going to be seeing not only bash Nagle we could take away Ohio State's middle look for Cornelius Green and look for Bosch Nega first down Ohio State under 32 yard line I tripped up saris Cornelius green he was trying to hand off to his fullback and then option himself out but Gary Jeter said no I'm gonna handle this myself and the left tackle of us see Gary Jeter who had to play against John Hicks at the freshman last year was bloated one of the top rookies of pro football this year Jeter of Cleveland Ohio made that play all by himself at the 3 yard loss Ohio State has a second and 13 they're on their own 29 yard line we have no score 8:15 to go in the first period fast nigga was in motion and has beat Johnson to pull back on the option play it comes up to the 35 let's go quickly to Ross border for report from the sidelines Woody Hayes told us before the game he wants to put a man in motion more today that he has during the past and John McKay's pregame plan was to run to that near sideline stay away from the open side but he did not do that and calls he picked off the pass Thank You Ross and I think what he Hayes is calling the plays sending any split ends hazel and Lynn Willis bringing plays in this fashion angle coming in motion this is green back to pass big rut John him drilled the screen to Griffin Griffin is up to the 40 and that's it he stopped short of the first down and Oates the Bradley again of senior nose guard from st. Joseph Louisiana brought him down from behind number 92 when you have a team in trouble and you know they're going to pass you can put the big rush on he gets it out early arch Griffin has only caught seven passes his first year five is second for this year and now the screen by urban cob is deep in front of him as Charlie Phillips it's called a knees punt another high spiral floating to cop on the 14 being hit and down he goes Holy Cross a fete furred Heights Ohio so now UFC's pin back deep in their own territory and well they talked it over we'll take a timeout and tell you the score is nothing nothing I'm wearing the sign of cotton look for it when you want to feel comfortable when you see it on towels you can count on them to be really soft and thirsty when you see it on sheets they'll be fresh and comfortable not shirts jeans jackets natural cotton makes you comfortable so when you're looking for comfort look for the sign of cotton the more cotton the better unity of the new personal midsize cars one is getting a lot of recognition yesterday's Dodge Charger got recognition for winning 75 racing titles today's charger is a midsized car with a style that keeps it ahead of the crowd and it's getting recognition maybe too much a dying man's last words lead to adventure and mystery on the high seas ralph bellamy heads an allstar cast in the log of the Black Pearl an NBC Saturday night movie at 9:00 8:00 central all right use us see coming up on her 14 yard line if the 13 and a half we'll call it the 14 that's Dixon motion 3:27 he had the first down Cancun the outside left linebacker brought him down helped by Tim Fox the safety man number 12 and Davis right now has over 50 yards already in this game i asked john mckay al i said is this man how do you confirm though Jason in the case that nobody good as OJ Simpson OJ is faster and bigger Anthony Davis their fullback rich parsons on even right now that USC metal is ripping openings in that ohio state forward wall let me try to set it up when you have a threeman front virtually with two linebackers your bust right at the middle guard then you take the linebacker when you've got a man like Rickey Bell he gets there in a hurry that is the key if Cusick and boy DiMucci beauty can not close off the middle ohio state may be forced out of his defense first down USC under 42 davis again 45 yard line on a slithering tackle by Tim Fox who ran laterally with him and hung right in there a threeyard pickup for Anthony Davis of second down 7 John McKay said he's deeper in fullbacks this year and he's ever been Rick Bell the sophomore Dave farmers a junior and mostly the two PO is only a freshman all three complaint and he'll play them all today Neal close he is out and rule has gone in now Bruce rule replacing calls you know what that's all about hey without emotion the 8yard line of Ohio State a big senior tied in 225 here it is from the end zone he hasn't caught many fast as he caught two big ones against Stanford to keep this team in and this is the way Hayden likes him the good quarterback knows how to use his tight end good play good call USC has moved the ball better to first period we have a scoreless change or five minutes to go first quarter calls he's back in now for Ohio State first down for the Trojans on the Ohio State 38 that pitches to Davis Davis to the 35 of Ohio State he spent there by Steve Luke one of the half acts the ohio state secondary also 75 in the sophomore nickel Bonamici that was student body right we talked about going to Michi number 75 he's just a sophomore and he's going to be a good football player he's got a good one in front of him also he played that well to be able to force it back to the inside like a down seven and their offside not quite though that's ringabel banging up the middle again and he stopped by Bonamici at number 42 Arnie Jones the middle linebacker now the ball will be spotted down on the Ohio State 33 yard line on a 32 yard line here's that situation again it looks like pass you can go straight up the middle if they're going to attack they may go after Steve Luke number 46 the Center converted to a cornerback third down and four USC on the Ohio State 32 run for the first down 25 yard line of Ohio State in kenkun of Louisville Ohio tackling there watch this hole open up from our end zone shot you know and he's running as well as we've seen a man run he's playing the holes beautifully as that great pervert peripheral vision this is where the eye is so effective that deep man has the opportunity to see those hold open look at that 65 yards for Anthony Davis already incredible Archie Griffin has only six yards the line ago it as an individual battle Davis has all the best of it Peyton hits the pass that's Anthony Davis coming out of the backfield they'll flare him out and throw him in the flat and try and let him go to work one on one and he's hit flat roofs rule who brought him down and Neal cozy there short of a first down this is a very scholarly attack this road Scholar is putting together here Kurt and how he's one of the few men in a football star I've been a Rhodes Scholar Carter now goes in for the first time replacing Anthony Davis he'll be number 21 second down in the yard to go diving for the first down of the 11 yard line is Dave farmer the fullback farmer hit by Ken Koon the USC has a first down the iformation as we said permit you to pick your hole that's Ilia right there Arnie Jones one on one blocking and he fixed the hole so perfectly good shot kentakun is out an Aaron Brown a freshman from Warren Ohio in two minutes to play in the first period what a dried this is by USC first down are on the 11 yard line of Ohio State they sent dick the win a flanker in motion now a counter play back to Ricky Bell it doesn't go anywhere Bruce Delia stopped that play number 36 he was a fullback last year a linebacker this year and let the team and tackles he replaced era Kent Q comes back in replacing Aaron Brown Woody Hayes now is really shuffling his line backing any secondary planet is something to stop the USC bully attacked that he's looking at hey sure is and again keep your eye on the top of your screen that corner Steve Lucas there he may get some excitement Anthony Davis is back in at tailback second down 10 for the Trojans there on the 11 yard line of Ohio State that's dicks coming in motion here's a counter back to Davis and he stopped for a loss that time Jim Koch 91 right on him from the keys fourth Pennsylvania the senior doesn't get the plaudits with Vandy Banda krita's of the other end but he's an outstanding defensive end it is now on the 13 yard line of Ohio State third and 12 for USC once again Steve Luke was man on man against number 25 John Mackay timeout and it's approach ins we're calling a timeout USC is asked for time and will take time out here at the Rose Bowl with a score and nothing nothing I cannot get if McDonald's Big Mac the big sandwich with a great big taste that everybody's talking about she'll be patty first offered to all the special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onions on a sesameseed

Sears Carter's replace Davis at tailback you might look for JK McKay now number 25 not easy to play on a powerhouse team coached by your father but the McKay's have handled it beautifully third and 12 out of motion is Carter Payton is looking looking fires and it is over McKay's head he was wide open McKay there number 25 nobody within five yards of him in the end zone and Hayden threw it over his head that's what they were looking for but he missed him the thing that was interesting they broke the pattern he could not locate his receiver downfield McKay took it to the inside and on the run as Kurt said he just missed the man all right Chris Lima Helu who made nine out of 14 field goals will try a 30 yarder last year he kicked a 47 and 42 yarder in the Rose Bowl his kick is up up and it is good and ufa scores first at this game and a 73 yards ride it was tall and then they cook getting to field goal ha stage so far has not been able to move against us see here's that rerun of JK McKay he leads a team at pass receiving he got 2 against Notre Dame areas that sees wide open but it's too late come on fire you saw a break in that defensive secondary to third two men went with the wrong receiver leaving him wide open the 1975 Orange Bowl from Miami the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame against Alabama Crimson Tide but it's exciting halftime pageantry will be coming up next after the conclusion of the road ballgame left field goal came with 41 seconds to go in the first period that's 3 nothing USC Welles's deep he bubble the last time to put Ohio State in the hole at the opening of the game he's flanked by Griffin and bash Nagle and Lima hey Lou and this kick coming to bash big 1110 he's out to the 20 to 25 yard line covering that check plate Matthews it was just a freshman and also Eugene Lord the sophomore all right let's see if Ohio State could crank up its offense so far it hasn't so far they've stopped the Buckeye bullet number 45 orange Griffin but keep your eye on him he could break long ones first down here's the reverse back to fashion a goal he has three yards and that's all he's trapped on his 32 yard line last year he carried only once in the Rose Bowl this year he's averaged 10 yards a carry he was hit by Kevin Bruce the inside linebackers in art Riley second down seven for Ohio State in this first period USC has had the advantage of a 10 mile an hour breeze the temperature is 55 going in motion as fashion eagle green flips it out to bash Nagle the 40 and he stopped at the 41 and now I think this is what they're going to have to do they may have to throw more than an Ohio State team wants to throw they're making a concession kind of early Kurt I'm not sure they have to they're trying to hit straight up at this point USC very effectively closing off the middle well a clock showed that the first quarter is over but let's wait to see what the officials are going to decide 1956 hundreds of grooves are cut right into airport runways grooves to help channel away water and improve traction on wet surfaces 1966 to help prevent water from building up under automobile tires grooves are cut into freeways because the less water under your tires the more traction you get 1975 Goodyear presents the new poly steel radial big foot with eight wide groove specially designed to help improve traction in the rain eight wide grooves that help prevent water from building up between the road and the tire by helping to channel it away big foot with double steel belts and a high fraction rubber that really grips on roads wet or dry get the tire that keeps its feet even in the rain Bigfoot the new poly steel radio only from goodyear john mckay three national titles he's been to this Rose ball now this is his eighth appearance there and that confusion the teams did not change goals we didn't know whether the first quarter was over or not we told you with nothing nothing is 3 nothing USC and Ohio State of the first down on his 41 yard line using Bashan angle and emotion a lot that's the fullback Johnson &amp; Johnson hips to the 43 yard line of Ohio State Richard wood Batman they call him made the stop there Curt a calm and I think worthy to make is that dick Mac number 69 have you talked about earlier is playing the center point against both the friendly a very tough assignment Steve Myers is playing guard there a second down eight bashed Hegel again in motion green then she got the Griffin Griffin over the fifty rides it into UFC territory Dale Mitchell the outside linebacker hit him that's the first time they've been able to spring Archie Griffin for any yardage he broke the big ten rushing mark midway in his junior year of a career of honor Otis Armstrong you saw two beautiful fakes one directly into the line the next one coming to the office Akal hole by the fullback arch Griffin going to the outside first down Ohio State on the USC 48 fashion Hegel again moving in motion you may be changing a play here there's the pitch out the grip of 45 and grippers out of bound chased out by Richard Wood who said he was going to play the game of his life today's last game for USC very active linebacker Kurt a thing when you've got it going now slightly not as yet as effectively as I I know highest state would like to get it going they cannot run up there going why they're in second short situation they got a lot of speed out here that's Lynn will is the man out of the flagger second down for the middle goes chief Johnson who weighs 244 pounds his coach Woody Hayes said he is not a good practice er but a good game Flair he was tackled by art Riley number 87 we're gonna have time out his Pete Bart Asik they tied in and what he's looking over now if it's a short yardage to go for a first down he'll send the second tight end into the game for more blocking power he's short by just a couple of inches also that second tight end is their second leading receiver so we know Bart aza can catch the football they have a third down and inches to go on the USC 38 yard line Bart Asik is in along with Duck France too tight in there's the roll plus T the full house backfield and green rolls out when the ball has a first down he was looking for the big gainer he was looking for one that might a gun all the way hoping us Lee was expecting a crack up the middle and he was going to bootleg and hope for a wideopen field but he got the first down anyway the trick really we keep pointing it out is to neutralize the middle neutralize number 92 close off the big tackle or fry early as they did their excellent fake go against the flow three to nothing USC ahead Archie Griffin at the 30 he goes to the 27 right now let's go to art to Ross Porter on a sideline Kurt Ohio State believes that if this ground game does not pick up in a minute they may have to go to the air they think they can work on the right cornerback number 23 Ron Bush who wasn't a starter until the eighth game of the year they have the speed and hazel and Willis you might look for that all right rush second down two to go Ohio State with this best march of the game Green keeper he's got the 20 inside the 15 is still going for the ball and let's see who's got it found at the bottom of the pile green fumble at the 15 the officials call time they haven't given us a signal yet Ohio State's ball let's lay it down at the bottom of that pile well McKenzie when you have a runner that himself as a quarterback and push a thousand yards you know you've got to realize it he's an asset looking at this defense however USC has changed slightly it looks like you could attack them straight up at this point I think that's Ted Smith at the bottom of the pile who recovered the fumble first down for Ohio State on the USC 12 yard line and hitting to the 9 or 8 yard line is Pete Johnson the fullback number 33 he's tackled by art Riley the right tackle number 70 put it on a nine yard line it is second down seven yards to go USC ahead in this game three nothing and now a high owe state has its first serious threat they're putting hazel wide right lining up in their eye formation with lash jiggle on the wing archie griffin at the five and he's down to the 4 yard line Kevin Bruce today helped by Ron Boyd acceleration is what makes a football player great this is a great football player with a great line in front of them he's at the line of scrimmage before the defense season Archie Griffin is starting to pick up yardage now two tight ends in the role busty backfield and Johnson is stopped at the two yard line they had to reach the two for a first down Charley Phillips came up the rover and Ron pushed the cornerback they're going to spot it just short of the two yard line they look to the far sideline and it is now coming into the game going out is part Asik coming in is Larry Kane 85 fourth down and a foot to go fourth and a foot for Ohio State on the UFC two yard line Ohio State is asking for flat so they could hear green signals 33 yards rushing for Archie Griffin 63 yards rushing for Anthony Davis more than likely we're going to see Cornelius green goes straight up either get the score or the first down if not it might get exciting for number 85 Dale Mitchell to the top of your screen linebacker has to stop the white flag four linebackers were in turn out for us see all that number 80 moved up France or was it encroachment and that is a legal procedure good branch move I'm thinking I'm sure it was Francis tied in on the left he moved he threw the USC player offside encroachment is five yards illegal procedure are costly friendly and Woody Hayes is unhappy on that one since five yards illegal procedure are costly friendly and Woody Hayes it on that one look at that and you read lips I did now time Flavin's the refugee from Czechoslovakia who kicked the house state into the Rose Bowl with four field goals against Michigan it made eight out of ten this year his kick is up up and the kick is no good he missed him to the right a 24 yard field goal is missed he hit three over 40 against Michigan and just the short one here but he had an angle from the near sideline illegal procedure Pedley cruz very costly to Ohio State and it cost them a possible touchdown or at least a six first down inside the 2 yard line now we have a timeout and now the score is still 3 nothing us see the man would rather drive a truck than a car he's got a feel for trucks and a head for trucks and he uses them both when he buys a dodge he checks out a payload in a Dodge it's big fourwheel drive Dodge is famous for it and this man can use it because he rarely doesn't drive all on a nice paved road the man would rather drive a truck without so many up immigrant grab a dodge every day this tailoring business gets tougher hey see that guy used to do his needlework but I lost them a para why he can walk in the most any fine store and walk out in Pharaoh slacks and a new fair jacket and caste equality and instant v I can't give him that and I'm the fastest needle in town Paris lacks in jackets everything about him looks tailormade are you gonna beat that George Burns Johnny Carson Alice Cooper and Redd Foxx joined The Smothers Brothers in the premiere of an all new weekly hour of music and comedy Monday January 13th on NBC George farmer pull back Anthony Davis at tailback first down USC on her own 20 they're ahead 3 nothing 953 to go and a half Davis who is he belted behind the line of scrimmage a steel coal see who came up from his position he's hurt he's really hurt he hit him so hard he hurt himself is it number one all right let's take a look at this both teams are fire that's Erin chunky brown moving brew she'll you're moving to the outside Pete kusik really making great penetration there's the hit cozy cause you coming to the sidelines momentarily and we'll take some time here to tell you the score 3 nothing us see what I have this friend Ron this is a very different in mine and uh we met when I was a plane with the Celtics and uh he was pretending he was a basketball player and ice to play and he'd watch and we became friends because I admired the way he watched Bill Russell oh yeah short guy built like a fireplug I know the guy no actually wasn't that bad best ball player he wasn't good but it wasn't bad he masqueraded as a player coach and I was the coach of the team that can now be revealed for the first time he the type of guy that you love you don't introduce anybody polite society Ashley I taught Bill Russell everything he knows about coaching I made him what he is today nothing he's always the same crazy good friends if it keeps so keep in touch long distance is the next best thing to being there palsy hipped Anthony Davis so hard they shook him up and had to take him out Ellen Carter's now the tailback Dixon's emotion this is Carter and he's just back to the 20 and that's all or short of it so now how spade is stifling my defense Nick want amici the left tackle tripped him up he's number 75 and they're working on Anthony Davis down on the USC fetch he was really racked up by Neal palsy you know the switch they really made that I think is the interesting one is they put 55 Aaron Brown Chucky Brown from Warren Ohio of freshman the nose guard and that is where it's at we'll keep Arianna evidently Woody Hayes is dissatisfied with his line backing in his defense so far has been making many changes it's the first time they have stopped UNC Hey running his printout hit mcusic usually pulling down everyone got to him around the ankle that's the best Ohio State has played on defense of any series but that's peach music y'all America he had a clever remark we asked him yesterday what he thought of he will come back of USC over Notre Dame East I was watching the game I had to leave the room in punt formation for the first time that Jim Lucas from Arcadia California he averaged 39 yards a punt back of the safety man is Neil cozy he broke this game over though he missed the ball he missed that he may get a first down he does he missed the ball and it picked it up and ran for a first down I can't conceive of that being a plan play golf you keep your eye on the ball he kept his eye on the man coming from the left there lad he just picked it they're going to put that play in the Booker definitely that's one of the great punt plays of those Bowl history that'll match Roy Riegel's wrong way run look at this one just take the end of it about a two yard punt he picks it up and runs for a first down look like an onside punt there the crowd is really roaring and murmuring about that but that'll be one of the Freak plays of all time with a hip tip first down USC on their own 33 Haiti did your dad a farmer the fullback is brothers Georgia pro ball and they're still talking about that play the case that I had it all the way three to nothing USD ahead 749 to go in the first half USC's ball on her own 36 second and seven Ricky Belle's back in a fullback well try and get some word about Anthony Davis out of motion goes Alan Carter hate rolling right lifts the ball nearly intercepted there it was meant for a platter bitch and Bruce Illya nearly grabbed it off let's go down a Roz Porter now Anthony Davis sustained a bruise just above the left knee about two inches above it he is now running along the sidelines he says you'll be back here now within a matter of minutes and one thing out you might look for is that USC appears to be keen on the Ohio State nose guard whatever angle he goes that they try to go the other way and that's one reason Hayden has been sending a man in motion lately to see how IO State reacts all right it is third down and seven USC having trouble moving except for the free punt for the first down now they have three minute spread out wide here's a three big setup look out he has racked up whoo he hit by Jim Koch number 91 and Ohio State is coming defensively now that was to the fullback Dave farmer hoof is laid back there I was waiting for that one another putt formation and let's see what kind of a play Jim Luke with the pull of time they're pulled hit the football better ill cozy and Doug plank are the two deep meant flanks up a little bit shorter Lucas failed a kick of the last time and his black and he failed a kick at this time recovered by Ohio State on the 17yard line and it's recovered I know anyone on the Buckeyes and that is max middle of the kicking game Tim Fox firing in from that right side over the football how many games won by how you kick the ball one time he wins this time he loses again watch box come in here now number 12 look at him they had the gap open for him and he smothers it the Lucas has yet to really put a dent and funning Hazel's in Ohio State first down on a 17 yard line of USC Green gives it the Johnson to pull back and he might have got to the 15 or 14 both the Bradley the nose Garth met him hit on there we've been talking about both eye formations and the entire first quarter and now both teams frankly are keying on the middle guard otha Bradley 92 for USC chunky Brown 55 for Ohio State USC ahead three nothing 610 to go in the first half fast Nagle in motion second down eight that's Archie Griffin he spins to the 10 yard line he stopped by okhta Bradley and art Riley this man has rushed over a hundred yards 22 games in a row so far today he has rushed for 40 yards he's starting new to near target now he was very slow starting the game but he's been picking up momentum Anthony Davis has 61 yards right now he has a fruis\u00e9 leg and he's on the USDF a third down two yards to go for Ohio State just over the USC 10 s Griffin Johnson as a purple mobile and USB has it Harvick cop recovered number 24 Ohio State is making classroom mistakes inside the USD 10yard line first the penalty and now a puddle the Trojans will take over and our score is still bring up the UFC to show how the new Goodyear Poly steel radial tire helps reduce hydroplaning wheel tested against an earlier steelbelted radio here's the earlier radial photographed from below

Merrill Lynch is bullish on America some folks say when teams are not playing for almost a month that's why they fumble that's not the reason here the hitting is off the heart it wasn't a good handoff and art Riley makes a super play on Pete Johnson all right USC has Anthony Davis back in they farmer the fullback ahead of him first down for the Trojans on their five Davis my friend he's met by Steve Luke there's a fumble pile up and let's read a little the officials give it to us like you stick down the bottom of the pile who's got it 75 wanna michi an Ohio State had the ball right back again okay let's see it again a bum buh buh so far the interception that's what does it look like he's got a good hold of that football bet by Steve book and a perfect tackle pops the ball out 75 1 Avicii makes the big recovery first down Golic Ohio State on the USB sticks and running to the 2 yard line is chip tense that was now command Harrell Henson who scored one touchdown every nine times

with power he said Jim Otis could score touchdown down around a goal line with a broken leg that's why I call him the greatest here's the kick now by claiming the kick is up with this guy going for

to tell you right now s Lenny Willis Leonard Willis he's the fastest man on the team and Ohio State is fired up on defense right now and this Willis kid can fly looks close to a face mask but it's not boy it takes courage to run it back and this man does it so beautifully but not then here's Willis had been happy it was all USC in the first bird has been Ohio State in a second quarter Rajan's ball

second and long one of the that the best town in football second and long quarterback sometimes draw if they do Bruce Elia will be one of the people who should be looking for it sometimes however when you've got a good tight in like obrenovic you try to hit him number 89 JK McKay back in for junior Lee second down 1073 Ohio State ahead 326 to go in the first half this is the draw play Anthony Davis off that tailback draws hit by Elia 36th and Artie Jones a freshman for a senior from Dayton Ohio we have a freshman in the lineup mount left tackle for Ohio State at diamond number 67 of Cincinnati there's Kuzak he seems to have something wrong with his Lake third down five to go USC under 42 yard line Alan Carter's replaced Anthony Davis at tailback Anthony Davis has 67 yards rushing Archie Griffin 40 yards to top running backs in America this year hello Paul fans will argue leather Joe Washington there's a rollout right down the middle though better bet he's got even the claim to 30 he was hauled out by Steve loop a perfect post pattern for the times I did what I call he comes at the draw and then he comes to his tight end he uses his tight end beautiful obrenovic hasn't caught many but does he catch the big one man hanging on him powerful young man just pulls away that's a 31yard pass he sets it up he had inside position on Fox and then had to be hauled down by Luke first down USC on the 27 yard line of Ohio State Trojans are fighting the clock they sent jigs of motion this is the rollout they give it off the David or the Carter Carter picks his way number 21 to the 22 yard line where he was upended by Tim Fox Carter weighs 200 pounds they just had a misfortune of playing behind one of the alltime USC grapes Anthony Davis in this football game Pat Haden likes to use self Sheldon digs infrequently kind of lulls you to sleep at this young man he's got great speed he's also going against the tumbling folks ere's dicks setting down a minute 40 to go and a half Carter plunges inside the 20 they might have tagged him down right at the 20yard line they do and I was started three and then decree of Warren Ohio we allamerican defensive end was a man that tripped him up here comes a farmer back in with a play and going out of Rickey Bell now they're getting down to crucial time a minute 10 seconds to go in this half Ohio State a hit seven to three it's third down free to go for USC roll out a gothic gets away and he's fun down on the 22yard line by the freshman demon a demon put him down number 67 who came in replacing QC e demon good lateral pursuit at Chris Lima halo is in let's get another report for price porter pto six severed a twisted knee he said but he'll be back here in the second half leave a halo 5 field goal now he's kicked one earlier in the game this is a 39 yard attempt flag goes down a house they may be offside the kick is good 39 yard field goal by little Chris Lima halo let's see what the penalty markers about it was offside Ohio State as we thought the friendly declined by USC 19 seconds now wait a minute u.s. they may figure an option here and they try mark off this five yards and see where it winds up 19 seconds to go an interesting decision and hates who can think it just went through the road Scholar examinations one of two from California's that it was a toughest competitive thing of his life all oral examinations to go to Oxford two years and his coach John Mackay says it's a million dollar award he'll come out of Oxford may not play professional football wants to be a lawyer because of English major he is the great advertisement for college football Pat hate whose father is the salesman for a medical supply firm offside against Ohio State has been accepted by USC Ali had the ball of a 17 yard line with a first down and only 19 seconds to go so they have turned down the Shura three points that they have they are we have another shot at that curtain again the big change I state made is right in the middle with number 55 in there Karen Brown first down 19 seconds to go and a half they gave up the three points Hayden throws to the sideline and broken up I can't cure the linebacker number 54 17 seconds remaining in the half they were trying to hit John McKay of the sideline pattern you'll be a marked man because inside the 20 they go to McKay who plays a lot like Fred Biletnikoff he's not overly fast but he has your feet can get open and has gluey hands not a great I said always is when you have it back that can catch the football you can always bring him out of the back to back it down 10 USC on the Ohio State 17 in motion is Carter there it is down the middle of complete at the 4 yard line Jim Fox made the tackle little Braniff it's the tight end and here it is first down end zone low the tight end what a vegetable weapon boy he's made some big catches I'm out by us Lee they stopped the clock with 11 seconds to go in the first half and one timeout left and hatin wants to be sure that one left chuckle robia friend cassis you are the only two football players at USC history deliver bit in the scholarship degree that hate has been in he started the season slowly passing but he wound up strong and by the way he joined a select group of young men recently when he was named one of the 33 winners of a $1000 NCAA postgraduate scholarship 11 of those postgraduate scholarships playing in seventh ballgame Alabama's Randy Hall tonight her name's Pete Debra Lee if Reggie Burnett he'll be seen in the Orange Bowl later here on NBC you saw Rickey Bell and Pat eight and walk in a very obvious strategy it's almost so obvious that you think he's not going to give it to Rickey Bell he might then call a timeout or linebackers in three Ohio State first and goal to go for USD 80 flares that optic arteries being crap we've gone for a loss at the 7 yard line 4 seconds and USC is called its last timeout of the half al the field goal team is coming on again and Chris Lima helu who kicked a 39 yard field goal for three points and then USC discarded the three points when they had a penalty on the field goal and took a first down now let's see of Lima hey Lou this will be a more difficult angle for him it's going to be from the near sideline and it's on the 7 it'll be about before how about a 24 yard shot he's so cool Kurt it's kind of hard to believe 5 5 there he is 130 pounds 5 5 130 pounds and just as cool as can be he made 38 out of 40 2 extra points 9 out of 14 field goals and it has a difficult angle here now much more than the 39 yard line they spotted on the 14 compartments a 24yard at them is up and the kick is Goga they've missed it they gave up the three points the head of the bank they gamble to go for a seven point and that's the end of the half with the score Ohio State seven and USC three Texaco understands what rough roads can do to ties and shock absorbers and Texaco understands that lights a radial or faulty voltage regulator

who buy Dodge and Chrysler Plymouth cars well I think of the new Dodge you can depend on it and that new 12 month unlimited mileage warranty you can depend on that too I put a lot of miles in the car

I've decided on a new Plymouth beautiful car beautiful warranties look for the first 12 months of use any Chrysler motors corporation dealer will fix without charge for parts or labor any part of our 1975 passenger cars we supply except tires which proves effective in normal use regardless of mileage that's it that's the clincher it's gonna take okay exclusively on NBC Sunday January 12 Superbowl nine the Pittsburgh Steelers meet the Minnesota Vikings they'll be exciting action and special programs at all begins at 1:30 Eastern Time Super Bowl 9 from NBC Sports number one in live coverage USC is going to receive on your left they open a second half a housemate will kick on your right USC has won the battle of statistics the trails on the scoreboard Trojans have 13 first downs to 4 for Ohio State they about rushed ohio state 132 a hundred total yardage a big margin for USC 213 to 113 two turnovers charged to Southern Cal one to Ohio State and in The Herald of Battle of Anthony Davis and Archie Griffin Davis has the edge 67 total yards in the first half even though he missed the playing time with an injury Archie Griffin had 44 yards three points will be remembered a long time some coaches say always take the points the block punt the second down in short yardage pass by Hayden that was intercepted by coldy the fumble that up by arch Griffin and then the fumble right back by Anthony Davis but it looked like us he was that a trouble TomSka Danny kicking off and it's a deep food coming out was it is Ellen Carter to the 10 and he is down on his 17 yard line and as Tim Fox who has been all over the bill today he's down there to help make the tackle and scold Danny is one of the few place kickers you see who also goes down and makes tackles what USC's ball now first down under17 they'll have Hayden and quarterback Ellen Carter is going to be the tailback Anthony Davis evidently is not right physically the pull back will be Dave Farber a K and Diggs are the wide receivers will benefits to tight end those men are at the skill positions eight knot first down on a quick give dad a farmer last of the bubble got it Leslie still hasn't all right let's take another look at they're driving off the ball bill well it could block the Atlantic Green move to the inside grabbing the football from farmer I don't think you have it mister decree you do but a little late second down five for the Trojans Powell and Knutson are the tackles Davis and main the guards McCaffrey's of center ricky bells a fullback he just brought in a play he chooses back in the game by the way they're the long pass nearly intercepted by Neal coldy as the tenant predicts is Colby can really cover in a secondary he certainly can't he has that rover ability Charles Phillips also has it for the USC Trojans with Cole Z impresses and current early made some of the hardest tackles that we've seen Ricky Bell goes out Dave farmer back in as a fullback and white Ford a highly touted freshman is now the tailback he's the heir apparent to Anthony Davis next year at tailback white Ford number 22 a third down play I have to go here the draw plate of Ford his blazing speed and he has hit at the 25 and down by Jim Koch number 91 they just don't get outside Koch he's refused to let him get outside today you're seeing one of the reasons why the attack at this 3 or 5 man line depending on how you think Jim cope and Vanda creep like hope can either come or be a linebacker that play he was waiting he was not coming he was really playing linebacker Alice Theo Jim Lucas and finally hit the ball with a putt he missed it once and picked it up ran for a first down the second time he had a blocked and that was nearly blocked but not quite that punched away and it's going into a house they territory and out of bound they'll mark it up along the 45 yard line of ohio state buckeyes ball with the first down if I had a sense what might be happening now I have to say the USC fans ought to be yelling defense you get the feeling that they're a trifle down and this is a very big defensive series Cornelius Greaves the quarterback number seven Archie Griffin the tailback 45 champ hips in the fullback 38 rolling out his green he throws as complete and he is frequently in the game he hit six out of eight last year and that's the tight end Doug cramps have caught the ball last year with a tight end named Pugh cheek that caught four greens passes Green trying to open up USC now first down Ohio State on the Ohio State 42 len willis is the flanker outside and they tried to blast up the middle it doesn't go far that's number 85 they don't mention the outside linebacker who crossed over to make the hit on Archie Griffin actually the USC defense in the interior has been doing a more effective job in the middle than the Ohio State team well hi is doing the better job at the outside corny green can pull it down he was wide open on that pass play before second down nine to go for the Buckeyes green with a roll out he could he goes to the 40s at the 35 he has a first down he's out of bounds on a 31 of us see both the Bradley drove him out Ted Smith was leading away the left guard the blocker Richard wood from Elizabeth New Jersey a lot of speed they say run at speed run away from strength this is the speed of Richwood but it's a big gain and corny green curry could be a real factor this hair alley certainly been a factor so far with his passing and running first down Ohio State ahead 7 3 early in the third quarter there goes dripping he just jumped up when he started

30yard line of us V as you look at that defense you may be wondering why is Ohio State playing so far off the ball well it's almost the same reason that really demand in the eye is playing so deep he gets a look at those holes they develop and the defense is trying to take that advantage away they're playing it off and they're reading making it a bit more difficult I hadn't noticed Tim Fox 12 and told the 20 holding hands in that defensive level does the slave gotta last another five and a half minutes coming through is Dave farmer to pull back was broken one of the longest runs of the game earlier they haven't got away from the gameplan there's the offensive line the men in the trenches great second effort we're going to see and continue to attack the same hole and Southern Cal as second down on their 40yard line second down and about of hook the goal we're going against the clock now under five minutes to play first down over the 45 up to the 15 and Alan Carter was running beautifully here in the second half running with power and he's been a putting back against the grain Carter now has piled up 63 yards mostly in the second half 446 clock is moving 20th time they spot the Trojans at their 49 17 to 10 Ohio State ahead us these balls down coming back a tricky fell fell on that delays into a high off a territory and the Cree get him around the ankle to Bruce Neely I

looking to the far side and the clock is still going and they're not even go to measure north down and a month ago USC must go for there's no down we haven't talked about this USC front often every John McKay said he's got so many allamericans this man would not make it but he doesn't think there's a better center in the country now McKay signaled Hayden to call a timeout two minutes and 34 seconds remain in this game and here's USA's crucial play coming up fourth down and a foot to go and they're on the ohio state 41 the Buckeye fan to sit up by jaleco bitching seems to realize the last two years Sina closest to this core when of the most see buying the only way at the battle is with a draw and Ohio State frankly is trying to fight off that very thing but always keep in mind if USC does get down there is that the twopoint rule can make the difference I don't know l get the outstanding player last year the most valuable player the top layer the Cornelius green here before Sam the BAM Cunningham at USD Jim Plunkett at 71 remember Rex turn with Ohio State at 69 Oh Jay Simpson at 68 there have been some players selected who have been on the losing team earning ever shirt the honors with Notre Dame's over late back at 25 many la Rose Bowl player of the game in 1929 for California right now fourth down and a hook to go biggest play of the game for us the appellant Carter and also the twofold running behind blocking gives us their first down how they needed that one okay we saw Ohio State goes left because of Schumacher well USC likes Newton and Bain and a big gain in P kusik is back in the football just put him back in hell USC has only one timeout remaining they have the ball at the Ohio State 38 on this Drive which started on her 16 that drone only one pass that

they're going for I don't know well he's not taking that much time to quote to talk over an extra point Kurt that's for sure I think John McKay also feels if I know John McKay that you try to win a football game he comes Pat hatin winding up a brilliant career is off to a slow start the last five games he's at nearly 60% of his passes and he just hit the big one 38 yards to his buddy JK McCabe and what a drive 84 yards for USC after Ohio State had put on an 82yard Drive now they're moving a ball over to the near hash marks all right Kurt keep in mind he likes to roll out also he's got plenty of room to the top to the right we may see him roll right and throw Neal palsy is on JK McKay they're going for to the could win it if they blow up they could lose him Peyton this was a rollout Rock Polly had the option adoption there's a blip digs right down on the ground that JK McKay right in faculty Aaron of the ground level L such a big play it deserves three but I'll tell you for 70

home they can't believe it when it's this tree and we have an exciting ballgame it rise you have to really fit that the success on this game here today as at Rich's game Georgia run this particular game of the trenches there was a very exciting effort the georgia defensive as well as offensive line they took control in the third and second period here yards out there's a Matt Robinson keeper play Levitt converted turkette was on the board at halftime here score Georgia seven the University of Alabama 0 in the third period with three eight teams ago rapier Williams where yards off Leavitt converted and Georgia was leading by a score of 14 0 and in the first parrot George's third touchdown and found a hit of the day came with about six minutes remaining in the corporate Larry Munson sat like this Georgia stick him down six and a half worth touchdown Alabama in that 65 defense again Washington wide Matt Robertson Robinson hitting Genesis noise from Monticello Georgia I know his family's very happy and a tremendous day culminating and a touchdown pass from Robinson the yellow sees Mars was certainly a cohesive effort here today braving water for great victories at coach Dooley will ever have one of the big ones you know occurred back in 1965 and certainly when you showed us the troops inside you do one heck of a job and really what happened we'd like to give our defense a lot of recognition in the let's play very well as a hold of junkyard game paper well we had some tremendous efforts can ill cry he had a tremendous game last week guys here this afternoon Lawrence craft recovered a fumble Greg Williams a team in late they're waiting minutes at the fork current Greg Williams at 2 SEC's quick emits today he was hanging them high and livid was kicking them wrong rookie as you know had two great pants 157 yards and 152 yards so there was certainly a cohesive is two and two on the year next week we'll be at Mississippi and that certainly will be a vengeance type fella game as you know we were born out there last year but hopefully we can get our team together and when number five of the 1976 season for special thanks to Larry Munson Luke Phillips and dick pain Randy Mullenix our engineer hit Christian our producer and of course Steve squid consultant another job well done with the back with you again next week at sixty thousand two hundred ninety three fans were here they saw it they were in the stadium about 25 or 30 thousand outside the stadium so it was run rewarding victory for Coach Dooley and his football team here the Santa Darryl this is happy Howard hoping the Jojo and Lauren Smith fanfic still we've had Lauren Smith I don't know if you can hear me but we have just got the most exciting and wild dressing room scene you can imagine in coach sensibility and the Georgia coaches are watching the player shave Pat Hudson so coach Dooley should be here in just a moment he's on the way and we'll have more right after this message from pat pat Mills today Vince last week I noticed a little twinkle in your eye late in the week that made me feel like you have little confidence but even you I don't think that you're gonna get a shut up Frank 1965 you're very stood up observer I don't approve of my night or somebody else assist the reason is that a complete confidence that this football team would go out and play as hard as they can play for 60 minutes sudden they'll have any idea what the outcome of the game was but I had that if I had a claim is because of that because I've got a lot of faith in this football team and I knew what they would do as far as their effort and being dedicated to win this football game so that was a tranquil so you had a lot of great place today but one of the things that you were most worried about earlier in the week was what you said was the availability of your offensive line to date to really take charge of the game that wasn't an improvement today in that department I felt like we had to have a complete football game and we had to start with controlling the line of scrimmage we haven't done the last two weeks perhaps this strategically and to smart in light of the fact that we think Alabama has three of the best down linemen in the country but we feel like we have some pretty good offensive linemen there perhaps having blocked as well as I think they could but I think they did today we control the line of scrimmage against the very fine Alabama defensive football team particularly strength in the running game and we knew that we had to try to take some advantage of some passing opportunities in light of the fact that Alabama is new in the other in the other areas so but oh no we won the game upfront we want it because we control the line of scrimmage and certainly the play right before the end of the half was a very key play Matt Robinson called that play and I'm sure that that was the last thing Alabama expected us to do was for Matt Robinson the passing quarterback to keep the ball on an option play and score the touchdown as a matter of fact that's the last thing I thought he would do when she had very good success in the second half coming inside coming so directly at Alabama we felt like that we could recover run the football because we have some success earlier running the football and I made a mistake of maybe trying to look for too many passing opportunities and not having a little more patience but thank goodness our quarterbacks had patience and particular rate golf when he took that third quarter drive and that was a beautiful Drive a long drive it ate up a lot of clock and scored and put us ahead 14 to nothing so we can talk to great deal about the optimist but let's say a few words about the defense when you shutout Alabama and I don't know when the last time Alabama has been shut out but when 69 that's been a few years well anyway it's been several years and so that's a major accomplishment we played great defensively we we got after their fullback who is such a power runner and if we did anything good on it we didn't get him a chance to get started because once that big ole bull gets started he is rid of something so we stopped that and we were able to get outside on the option or we reduce the passing game somewhat and I guess we took advantage of some of the inexperience at quarterback we did bless quite a bit and we threw the Alabama quarterback Rutledge particularly two losses and I'm sure that this ball game he'll learn a lot from it and will go on to be a much much better quarterback but it's truly is an experience but the same time we played great defense and when you rest your shutout and that's our second one this year you've you've done something great and we did some great on defense we've been talking with Georgia head coach Vince Dooley and this is Lauren Smith you",

Texas Tech defensive line parochial bill Boswell Jim crawl and Richard are legion they're really tough they're very quick the linebackers Thomas Howard all Americans Gary McBride of the middle Mike mock on the right side it is third down three for the Corps Nestor turn this quick number 33 on the reception's hey look first down take a look at it again on the moon brother he hurt his credit kind of a surprise Carter Miss Nebraska Dean pretty good receiver though Ferragamo who threw for 2,000 71 yards and 20 touchdowns ready to go against this defensive backfield Eric fountain and Don Roberts in the corners and that eat better new frame pressure to the 35yard line Rick burns the eye back who's Barry during 26 3 and 200 pounds of sophomore who has started only three games this year and he gets five yards and Italy it will be a second down coming on and seven yards to go the ball is spotted just across the 40 yard line now a Milito 89 wide dump at the 44 gym crawl the right tackle and Mike hog the linebacker stop the play he got about three it'll be third down and four for the Cornhuskers Curtis Craig is coming to the sidelines Dave Shamblin 81 is coming in and waiting back for the Cornhuskers of Nebraska you know when we said at the top of the show that both these teams were explosive offensive little brother you're going to see some tonight Nebraska games about Florida Jeb yard average 31 point ever gain Makena at midfield in the first down in detect territory in the 49 Duprey making the stop gain of seven what a football player he is brother did this take a look at it again he picks a little draw there grows the burns that burns you know he didn't he started the season as a fourth team running back he's not even the pressed guy worked his way on up through just a lot of injuries he getting it right off he had five guys up front and crawl really made a great play protect ball on the fence a first down Nebraska 45,000 about the 43 year old a second billion dollar bill makes the stop what's his thing again from ground level you know Curtis Greg was a wrestler out of Highways that keep those wrestlers in our heavily recruited young mayor little trickery they don't mind mixing it up they throw it up reverse it you will see a lot he got seven and it'll be second down in three of the corner screws up Nebraska Davis out of the ball on the sidelines that I recalled in the corner back out with an injury that was Larry Duprey who got it out of our it'll be sucking down chuck that third down and three coming up Larry Duprey boy that's a familiar name should be to you harder son of LG to pray a great Baylor back played with the Baltimore Colts team made a man up there tell you funny story about all right we have let's check that last down there every one of a measurement ball will be officially spotted there it's on the near side in front of the Nebraska Finch at about the 40 yard line so we'll take a long look at that one any part of the ball but of course we can't see it too many red shirts the Nebraska fans will tell you or the Nebraska bench will and the first down let's take a look at Larry Dupree and there he is grayish to speak I talked to his mama sissy she told me a funny story there's no long gone Larry five years old he had his best game against Texas when they upset Texas he said his daddy told him about when he beat Texas too he looked at the old films Larry did found out his daddy score two touchdowns but allowed three on defense he didn't consider that winner of the game first down the red forty yard right through the middle across the 35 and down to the 33 and Mike Patterson the left cornerback makes the tackle 8 yards checked at 7 yards on the play it'll be second down now at about three so Nebraska after the opening kickoff is March from its own 20yard line down to the Texas Tech 33 the only team to be tipped this year was Houston 27 to 19 jerry macwrite the middle linebacker junior out of Midland Texas a real tough cookie on that stop now we've got a third down and listen to the yard to go who is that masked man well there's the mascot of Texas Tech at least one of them of course the mask rider will not perform tonight because this field of course artificial turf Ferragamo down back sneak at the 28th almost the 27 view bot will crawl early macwrite look at a head the size of that all bits of line of the Nebraska team that's going to be the difference I think in the night's ballgame should they come out on top Texas take a much much smaller team but as you mentioned marrow they are quick Iran its first job in the Cornhuskers at the 28 yard line of Texas Tech Vince Ferragamo who is a premed student NCAA the option by the defense might mock the linebacker in Mike Patterson 29 coming up to stop the play shirt yard each picked up about a yard or so it will be second down and nine talking about Vince Ferragamo he played high school ball for his brother Chris out in Carson California attended University of California for two years where he was the starting quarterback ahead of mr. Brett Kelsey we regard Casper that's right they do you Kellyanne back here Texas done 25 to the 23:43 is Kelly on the tackle and Texas Tech's Gary McBride is getting some attention he's the middle and out of Midland Texas take a look at that last play again for the end zone there where gumbo handing off right up to the middle that's what they're gonna do they're gonna try to establish that running game straight up at him there's so much bigger than Texas Tech third down and six Milito wide to the left one macwrite looks like he is brilliant thereby freeing the tight end who went up high to pull it down the junior out of Ventura California and it's another first down Ferragamo doesn't hesitate whatsoever when he needs to throw it they mix it up real well look to his left there he seemed he's a bright guy as you mentioned pretty good student over there at the 14 yard line after an 8 yard pickup first down Nebraska no score we're in the first period of the astro Bluebonnet bowl game with 803 to go in the first quarter now don't need to know a junior at a Hackensack New Jersey painten's his way to the five and Nebraska is now starting to pound on the doorsteps of Texas Tech after a gain of nine take a look at it again just off that right side you could block him up there by Steve horns and Steve link list open a big hole we're done el probably much he's more of a block at me as a runner gain less than 500 yards this year but he's still going to respectable rushing average about 4.7 detect defense called on to stuff the cornice for a second west of the yard before possibly the three I'm sure they made dead yardage let's see where they line the ball up and it may be close enough to call for a measurement Mike mock the linebacker out of Longview Texas and grit Frazier who intercepted poor this year a weak safety making the stop he's from Iowa Park Texas first down Nebraska first and goal to go on the tech floor no score 718 to go in the first period you know that was Texas Tech's biggest problem is you know they had an explosive offense I think that led to conflicts at offense couldn't keep him bison from scoring from him this year they've got a lot better job giving up about 17 points a game though of the two burns brought down by Don Kelly 43 the middle linebacker take a look at it from ground level and watch number 51 de and Schmidt pulling guard there number 51 you'll see him there make it a good block there suit finally gets him he tripped up there a little bit second down goal to go 2 yard line Rick burns gained 854 yards and score tonight or out of Wichita Falls easy I back number 35 a little short I don't know I don't believe so well take a look at Thomas Howard the allamerican linebacker for Texas Tech when a player Thomas Howard is he is easily the outstanding defensive player on the field tonight I think you're my opinion trying to go over the top though you got to go along and hard to get away from Thomas our an allamerican from Lubbock in Texas right down underneath that big stack third down goal to go inside the world Curtis is in Bothwell is up luck tackle for Texas deck offensive line that's where it is Tom Davis steve linguist dan smith doing the job what's it forward roll there watch him move off the ball they're just moving them back into the end zone no trouble whatsoever Richard Bern so the Cornhuskers march 80 yards nineteen plays one more time watch him control the line of scrimmage there you see it speaks for itself they've got the entire defense in the end zone so Nebraska's on the scoreboard with 542 to go for the extra point try veins to Rosco 3year Letterman senior it's good with 5 minutes and 42 seconds left to play in the first quarter with a timeout of the field to score Nebraska 7 Texas Tech

out of on he's a sophomore from Omaha Texas that defense was out there a long time they should be worth at Texas Tech's been an explosive team this year the average about 28 points per game Davis well Anderson Sears iron that's the Texas Tech offensive line interior a gain of 14 yards on the play Larry Isaac coming out of the backfield owned by a tier 8 Phillips look at the rollout action by Rodney Allison Rowland after the right he's a mobile quarterback our winners about all I could say for him Larry Isaac just a sensational year he broke down the Anderson's rushing record up up there Texas Tech first and ten for the Red Raiders Sammy Williams 80 wide to the left to the right side is Brian Billy Taylor the BT Express gets a yard or so it is stuffed by Ron through it 91 and Jeff pullin

14yard pickup on the play well Sarah Texas Tech doesn't go to Brian Nelson Darion he's only got nine pitches on the season the two of them didn't get the fetch down rolling action we're actually to the right to the left the guy throws the ball pretty well at the 27 of Nebraska after this reception but Brian knows the flashy receiver Wichita Falls and his first down for Chuck pull in the middle door seven tackles this year stopped about ten good for the first down it'll be close first down Texas Tech I believe let's see makes it outside cut situps at the inside I want to tell you something the guy could throw the ball he's an excellent runner three minutes four seconds left to go in the first quarter Nebraska leading seven another context gain of 5 on that one and George in who's the defensive end from Omaha Nebraska Cornhuskers Rodney Allison who threw for 1,400 58 yards this year and rushed for 523 at all Southwest Conference selection going against this Nebraska defense him

the Kansas City Chiefs he's made a mark name for himself already they're just a junior defensive play of the Cornhuskers number 44 hershey Eichelberger the weak side linebacker a senior from Louisville Mississippi came up with a super defensive play there at the 11 4005 you'll notice Nebraska's usenet fiveman in front a pretty standard with it as long as they're effective to get self to

down to Ron Franklin you know you know a littleknown fact is that Rodney Allison was actually heavily recruited by the Nebraska Cornhuskers but the amazing thing is they wanted him as a defensive back

little lecture on the sidelines for Texas Tech it's the adjustments instant adjustments brother let's get out of run frankly hey just a few moments ago before the Nebraska offense went back on the

and is it a fumble or it is a fumble he did not have you fortyeight the defensive right in and by Hera Buell coming from the opposite side and the fumble turns it all over blindside shot this is what quarterbacks dread fear to the right there he doesn't see anything a pill coming in the right side corner your screen as you see it don't know about that arm that was real close that's the first turnover the ball game in Texas Tech at the 30 what the Ellison trol wide receivers each side the 27 he was tripped up by Percy Eichelberger number 44 making the action there in the middle trying to

endzone some got around in my Villa Taylor and he put that take a look at it again is Ronnie Allison he's a quarterback in a winner not a picture quarterback look at the moves here by Billy Taylor watches he cooked that ball over the goal the rules state it's where the flame of the ball is in regard to the goal line he's coming up a little short but look at that that's a well coached team by the awareness to do that now the extra point try and we'll be coming up and here's Taylor once again and Texas Tech 10 Nebraska 7 on the first day of Christmas guess what I gave to me one stomach

14 yards once again it's where the plane of the ball is in regard to the goal line and watch it when his knees hit the ground that ball is over the goal line very very alert pleat telling the defensive captain giving it a very best shot and by the way he can really stick he reminds me of Tom Novak the great allamerican of past years of Nebraska on the return this is going to be Curtis Craig Larry flowers downfield there's the hero for Texas thought not Billy Taylor we congratulate him I'm telling you I like a competitor like that I asked Steve Sloane if he would be drafted by the pros that's legal Rodney else and he said he didn't think so tough possible he's backed up Tommy Dunn if it would tommy donovan started a season was hurt the 13th play of a crossing the 20th the 22 and being welded by Don Robert 16 the right quarterback and Harold Beal the outstanding defensive left and number 56 he got four on the play of the lease second down and six for the rest upon history you mentioned hail bill he was a well sought after well recruited running back coming out of high school II hurt his knee and he loses the linebacker and they weren't the beef up that defense he's done a job for complete on the swing to the tight end Duprey in the two faith number 86 Kim's faith pine blocker catches the ball very well a junior from the Hahnemann New Jersey he's a big guy 65 to 28 he's probably the most improved player on that team but he really has done a job last year to this year Tom Osborne and the big red from Nebraska third down coming up for the Cornhuskers in complete faith the kite in put on again by the Texas Tech defense kenny faith feeling oh so badly about them and you know we're talking about Tom Novak a little while ago the great allamerican fullback and linebacker at Nebraska veers gone by and understand that Thomas hospitalized but watching the ballgame tonight we all remember him so well you talk about a guy that that could really play this game and enjoyed every minute of it that was Tom Novak Randy West with his back to punt for Nebraska with a thirty nine point seven average for his career forty this year Mike Patterson fair catch buddy recovered it inside his own 30 yard line Mike Patterson Steve Lindquist on field in the coverage for the corner screws a kick of 42 yards three on the return and a timeout on the field of the score Texas Tech 10 Nebraska seven Mahnomen 45yard kick across the three yards of eternity Paul Minnesota the youthful Steve Sloan just signed a new 10year contract to coach Texas Tech in two years he has really put the show on the road in West Texas and he's on the road a lot he did the same thing at Vanderbilt ooh all right the Red Raiders ball what about just inside the tech 30 the option and tailor really takes a wife and he crosses the 30 Larry velocity Jimmy Williams make it play subtalar gain of 4 on the play this again I don't believe there's a quarterback that I've seen this year the runs that option any better than Rodney yells waits for the last second there he's got it all together great great college player don't know whether you go that far too close another brother glad to have him in Texas damn Jimmy Williams the cool breeze down at fullback a junior on the Garland Texas for the Texas Tech Red Raiders Sammy Williams wide to the left Nelson is in tight this time he's got a first down and can't fit the monster man laughter a nineyard pickup is he quick he can go to the left there take a step to the left like he did that time to walk back to the right make up the difference quick feet a quick Nebraska seven the only common opponent these two teams had this year Colorado Texas Tech open the season with a twenty four to seven win over the Buffaloes and then Nebraska beat the bus 24 to 12 the orange fleet chillin the strong linebacker makes the tackle short yardage on that one very level in fact Pilon is a lot of football player 129 tackles we made this year that's more than anybody on the on that defensive ballclub 65 unassisted times the think he came to school without a scholarship Finnegan just a walkon Merle Harmon Alex Hawkins and Ron Franklin 20 of the 18th annual Astro Bluebonnet bowl game in history Texas and fyodor second down to the 40 not about the nipple 13 Dave Butterfield and Larry Vlasic finally stopped to play after a 17yard pickup watch the pulling left guard Mike series turns it inside looks inside doesn't actually make an exceptional block but it gets into people's way and screens it gets off that pursuit allows else in the move right on down the field a ball at the 38 yard line of Nebraska Texas Tech on Nebraska's corner late taking the opening kickoff and marching 80 yards for a touchdown that came back with a field goal then recovered the fumble at Martin 34 to her infrared leading touchdown the draw Julian good defensive play the number 72 the allamerican Mike folks number 72 is senior from Lincoln he teams with Ron through it they called him the best two defensive tackles in the country what spike putts folks they're rather allconference player and some people's allamerican player I'm a 72 on the play three yards it'll be second down and 13 the ball spot on the 41 of the Cornhuskers 821 to go in the first half Texas Tech leading 10 to 7 Rodney Allison at the controls protect Paul may have been deflected when sailing up there Tony Samuel had the rush 98 coming from the right side incomplete Sammy William was the intended receiver and Billy Taylor I believe is bringing a play in the sidelines he reports in and Jimmy Williams goes out at fullback for the Red Raiders of Texas Tech when Nebraska came into this game I think they were probably a small favor but all game many people thought that there was going to be an upset Red Raiders now got it going Williams left Nelson right third down thirsty Buster Brown and the ball is then dropped after a pretty good hit at the 20 thought it might have been a researcher and funded Kent Smith really unloads on Brown and watch it launched a man Kent Smith there number 23 you seem really unloads as you said no Lester ban could not hold on to it there's a good defensive play their first move now it is fourth down and 13 for Texas Tech on the Nebraska 41 yard line David millat let's go to behold our checkered Mallette will try the field goal the long field goal dami is holding this will be from the 48 making a 58 pretty good distance it is not good it is up to the lab a lot kept the Longman's the real long ones and that was

allamerican good punt returner man he just had a good year pretty good hard hitting tonight hawk has been all night but we expected the same kind of game that will get here tonight it's a good now we'll have a measurement whether we'll have a first down or not Butterfield was scheduled to go to the hula bowl of the Japan bald Brian Nelson is going to the sidelines he was shaken up a little bit first down for Texas Tech Nebraska opened the ballgame but driving 80 yards on the first possession for a touchdown to go ahead seven to nothing then tech came back with a field goals of 28 yards by Brian hall and it was 73 Nebraska at the end of the first quarter as Butterfield is getting attention in the second quarter it belonged to Texas Tech until the final minute and a half when Nebraska put a TD on the board first and ten completed to Godfrey Turner going back to replace ball and it's a first down a gain of 15 go up what precision and running patterns all that he's been doing that all night Alice has been baking like two runs to one side coming back throwing against the grain Godfrey Turner and just an excellent pattern that time very precise money throw was right on the money Rene Anderson who replaced the injured Dave Butterfield the junior and Los Angeles made the tackle for Nebraska Texas Tech first down on the Red Raider 40 Vanessa comes up the phone and let's see what we have we had flags thrown as the player was developing we'll take one more look the market number 76 Mike Sears he's coming out right here he's a fine guard there that ball was pitched forward certainly was and it makes it it in completed pass covered by Vlasic we had an illegal procedure call against Texas Tech that's just a running shuffle pass as all I was reminded me you're passing arm when you were top Carolina I wasn't good with it that's the voice of Alex Hawkins the hawk Merle Harmon with the hook and Ron Franklin in the Astrodome in Houston now Nebraska will make a decision cleat Pelin number 61 the linebacker and cocaptain making his choice Rodney Allison has had an outstanding night for Texas Tech quarterbacking this fine tech team which is a coach champion to the south what I thought was a flaw an illegal procedure on the offense incline we have an illegal procedure call against the officers decline start to tell you Texas Tech cochamps of the Southwest Conference with Houston losing only to Houston Houston meanwhile lost two ballgames one outside the league and represents the Southwest Conference this year in the Cotton Bowl tomorrow great Turner 82 is wide left Williams to the right Donna Percy oculomotor who's injured in the first half but came back here in the second half 19 yards picked up on the play tremendous drive by Larry Isaac and once again I can't say so much for anything but that's execution of this Larry Isaac going on his own breaking tackles all over the place he brought in the Allyson setting it up beautifully he broke tackles by cleat pellet and Ray Phillips and when you break a pill and tackle you've got to be pretty tough and a Ray Phillips tackle as well he's no slouch now tuck for the 17 to 14 lead we have 13 41 to go in the third quarter first down Texas Tech Billy Taylor 33 off his own right guard to the 39 Ron through it and jeff pullin the middle guard fruit missed the 1975 season with a broken ankle e63 247 pounds out of Compton California well he was heartbroken last year to ajudar well imagine they were expecting allamerican honors for him can't do anything about those injuries he except come back and he's done that this year was 62 tackles after a gain of three second and seven wide left Williams to the right side at Turner they complete the a great catch by Williams keeping a foot inside and Rene Anderson head the coverage of 16yard gain in a first down Texas Tech and he said it Meroe only in college ball have to have one hit that Anderson the Allison throw the football couldn't roll it any better than that as I say it's a Billy Kilmer looking ball but it gets there and it's perfect mo Williams doing a good job to keep that one foot in them there's the paid attendance tonight fortyeight thousand six hundred eighteen the Astro Bluebonnet ballgame first and ten Texas Tech Boni Samuel and Rene Anderson on the Cornhuskers make the stop does he run that option and as you run the option watch him now right go trying to string it out there you see nobody trying to keep him award and contain him out there it's doing a great job consistent blocking out in front of it but that allison is just one heck of a well I'm sure he's sorted for eight touchdowns and rushed for Tim this year Mike Sears an all Southwest Conference selection for three years running number 76 without blocking inside the 10 brought down by Clete pilling a gain of four let's take a look at it from the end zone I see what it looks like on there good blocking up front there once again was Mike Sears and Dan Haren Isaak six various 35 yards have a second down and seven in the second period the Red Raiders grab the lead from Nebraska on touchdown passes from Allison to Billy Taylor two of them one for 14 after recovery in from the 16 yard line Kent Smith and Alessi could not stop it Cobell acceleration correlation and the scoreboard goes wild the Astrodome then I Taylor one afternoon the third touchdown on the afternoon to go receiving this woman look at the acceleration small hole in there just a big burst there will not be a nod as he crashes on in 80 yards 11 plays using 328 of the clock and the extra point try up than good but Brian Hall 24:14 and we'll give you see it he blocks again though Mike Sears and damn Aaron's on that side they're always your strong side tackling car well there's a time out in the field now on the score Texas Tech 24 Nebraska 14 speak up speak up I can't hear you well Texas Tech Valley Nebraska 24 214 and David milada senior out of San Antonio will kick off to Rick burns and Kurtis break for Nebraska these Red Raiders do cover all those teams burn John Klinger was down field along with Don Kelly on the coverage and do they do a job on those teams those special teams a punch to the kickoff coverage for the Texas Tech even the kickers getting down there david malan gone down there they can help out some shut up boy if you imagine six yard line all right Thomas Burton who had hoped that his team could really turn it around here in the third quarter well now watch this go Huskers from their own six jamielynn across the 25 to the 27 Don Roberts making the tackle a gain of 21 yard and up here's how you get out of trouble in a hurry vince moranto Ferragamo whatever a day's shampoo look at the protection he had that time Borough wide open receiver thereby chambray Nebraska which likes to throw the ball and can really throw the wall the mountain must now move in our area 11 13 to with a third period they're down by 10 o'clock right Nebraska almost the 33 Dana the right tackle from Houston makes the stop for Texas Tech we figured he's thrown for putting 1 touchdowns now on the season Ferragamo proved in the second quarter he can move in a hurry after Tech and scored two touchdowns he moved in a minute 21 seconds for a touchdown 80 yards there's his record of the game Bryson did Bilbao 1275 senior from Las Vegas New Mexico and Gary McBride 59 the linebacker stop it let's watch that Red Raider defense stiffen up they didn't come far enough good penetration there it was bill Bothwell on the bottom and try had slowed him up Keith Bishop was in for a play as Tom Davis the regular Center was hobbling the downtown is back in in the shot right on the way third and five Oh we'll have to wait on it I'll say wood he's a 440 man in check 51 yards on the play Chuck Pulido a hurdler you know Chuck we got the linen pants going this time where's gray not that he had cups at all today that is that the turn faster they could have thrown it let it be adjustment that's our hardball you won't find the harder passing that the catch having to move that in so I decided to look directly up when the ball comes down good job attention that man Alito said of Nebraska record with four receptions for 166 yards against Hawaii chair first down 18 senior touchdown by Rick birds of Nebraska for the Huskers in six plays in two minutes of eight seconds you believe it a typical Astro Bluebonnet Bowl game football load me up on the extra point try now it is not good it is up to the right seconds remain in the third quarter came out of the field as guard 24 the Brassica 20 now I'm a man who's known for his pleasures these two I trained this one I drink light beer from milk it's got 1/3 less calories than their regular beer and it's less filling but what I love best is the way it tastes what a pleasure right guys Amaya trainer or a bio trainer familiar everything you always wanted in a beer unless now you smell mediciney you didn't need to go but my mouth wants fight bad breath go fight bad breath too but your breath smells minty fresh not many scope fights bad breath scope doesn't give medicine breath one more time on burns touchdown and the key block of course is Steve linguist that's where it's played up front there and you see him kicking a man out first cutting back inside linkless Doherty done the job knocked his man all the way down the youngster goes in for his 11th touchdown on the season what a career he's gonna have to and Rick ferns scoring his second touchdown of the night going back deep but Texas Tech our Nelson 87 and Isaac 34 Isaac to the near side now they're gonna drop a third back and a leveland will kick off the Nebraska twenty four to twenty Texas Tech third quarter at the ten larry isaac the down the ball is d at the ground apparently i think he went down there to get it and just inadvertently that right knee hit the ground why is this man so tired on New Year's Eve or any other day well I know that position well I spent ten years right there there's a photo taken from 1910 when Alex Hawkins was with the Baltimore Colts and I think I was only 13 years old thank you and why did Fran Tarkenton fast John Unitas the alltime passer in the NFL because number 25 dropped the ball hold on that was in a championship game as the only fumble I ever made at the 11 yard line of Texas Tech Tech leading 24 coming with the ball Rodney Allison the next Larry Isaac the Nebraska defense now seems to be all charged up a gain of about two it'll be second down and eight make that three yards and second and seven Nebraska charging back on a 94 yard drive in six plays for a touchdown after Billy Taylor had score enough 8 yard run his third touchdown tonight for Texas Tech he Billy Taylor did he take a pop that hole closed in a hurry mercy Eichelberger 44 the senior linebacker from Louisville Mississippi nailed him after a three earned gain its third down and four for Texas Tech and there's Nebraska going in for that five man from stunning a little bit in there let's see if they use a little bit of stack knee pizza now the Texas Tech bench and a quick look on the nebraska side medical attention for the starting center Tom Davis who followed allamerican Rick bottom looks like he's got a little ankle problem third down for Texas Tech Allison at quarterback they start didn't sagging that defense hard to run again and the picture the last moments occur the defense responds with vilasa in before the safety man from Silver Creek Nebraska stopping the play again well they get practically nothing and let's see what it's going to be fourth down fourth down about two and a half and the punting unit is on with David Ragan doll who boomed a sixty well effect a record punt in the first half here in the Astro Bluebonnet Bowl 61yard cut by Kuykendall going back deeper Nebraska simple safety they were going for the block and they did in velocity covering the water and SOTA Braska was going for the block than they did it and that's up in the brass get up no really do is go after them they usually set up the return take a look at here it's coming I don't know who got it but if there was anybody any number of people that might have look at that rush I guess they figured it just as well go ahead drown a block Kent Smith the monster man is a man who that one that kicked about three that one that kicked about three yards Nebraska the ball trailing the four points now Vince Ferragamo Ferragamo Brandes the lead in this wild scoring day with the Astrodome miss coverage on that play to have anybody that wide open it in so he had a 65yard or against Hawaii pass of the season quarter by hit standing in there a real strong under that rush you see how open the

know what state he's in right now well 273 yards offense for both teams so we're about as close as you can get and then his fleet pill and we said Eichelberger filling up course that outstanding performer for Nebraska from Monroe Nebraska a senior twoyear letterman with a hundred twenty nine tackles this year we have already told you that he was a player of the year in the big 8 and all of the great selection he's not a big guy he's 205 pounds and 6 feet tall but you talk about tough now he wants to stay in the ball game right now he does not want to leave or they will miss him if he comes out of there I think twice he's been named Defensive Player of the Year look at that he said let me back look come on let me loose here what a game he had against Oklahoma last year 30 tackles so fleet pull and will come to the sideline and you can see that number he plays tonight the University of Nebraska he's a players player right there and by the way let us also thank the Nebraska athletic administration staff athletic director Bob Devaney who really put Nebraska on the map in a big way to say is the coverage by de Butterfield it was shaking up earlier but has come back he might have it defensive play on that one a great effort by Sammy Williams diving into the end zone just a little bit too much half in front of it past predictions good as Allison sets a pocket there look at it it's just a matter of just a inch or so have knocked them for the coverage there he might have held onto it anyway we have four minutes and 20 seconds remaining in the third quarter Dombrowski leading Texas Tech 27 24 bill benefit away is handling the spotting assignment tonight for Nebraska we certainly appreciate that very much bill now Steve Sloan and his staff of course the Texas Tech Red Raiders staff is headed by JT King the athletic director this ID is Rob commoner and assistant si d Alfred white is also spotting for us tonight handling the Texas Tech Board Tom Osborne and Vince Ferragamo talk it over Ferragamo has hit 11 of 100 and or other 11 of 16 passes for 134 yards some aspirins gonna have a happy new year just not gonna itself of another threeyear contract the extension there Steve Sloane got him a tenyear extension on his they want to keep these gentlemen and Alex we're going to announce right now that you're getting an extension also guys I know what's a reprieve I'm not interested in extension give it five more years now fell out gracefully and astrodome welcome it's 34 degrees outside in Houston but it's 72 degrees inside all the time yes the cold weather is it the Houston area two of at the Panjshir churches we proud of course Texas Tech with them all on the Nebraska 15 it's a third down coming up in seven yards to go but the Red Raiders Rodney Allison Dave Butterfield Brian Nelson high in the air and he was really felt by Dave Butterfield as you will see and that's why Butterfield is an allamerican for interceptions leads a team in that department good solid football player he's out of cursing Colorado whereas father's a school superintendent and he's a senior the pros would be looking at him tonight you can bet on that now it is fourth down and Brian Hall has come on to do the honors now if he can if he could is holding Italy from the 22 making it a 32yard the way and so Nebraska will take over the 20 yard line stopping a long Texas Tech Drive and this crowd is almost left here in the third quarter with 409 remaining to play in the third period and Nebraska charging from a 17 to 14 deficit had to have to go ahead now and has been ahead by a score of 27 to 24 Nebraska's Vince Ferragamo joined a select group of young man recently when he was named one of the 33 football winners of a $1500 NCAA postgraduate scholarship three other 76 recipients are playing in ball games and let's take a look at Vince Ferragamo right now near the 25 44 and 59 mic maken Gary macwrite the linebackers right side in middle it'll be suckin down v after a pickup of 5 Dave Shamblin coming in as a wing back now for Nebraska and Chuck Pulido who's had a very active third quarter is coming out you know a lot of cases you see a team it's a headlight get scum storm back like the Huskers have sit on the ball but you can't predict Vince Ferragamo and the eye back is burn and burns cuts across the 25 Way is brought down the bill buck wall and Mike Patterson for Texas night he got about to Italy third down and along two yards to go Vince Ferragamo number 15 an OL American out of person California who started his collegiate career at you Callen Berkeley where he was the starting quarterback Adam Steve Bartkowski they transferred to Nebraska premed student he hopes to play pro football but he definitely plans 45 15 40 Oh rip burns down bike Galip of 43 yards erect burns and let nebraska in rushing this year and now he'll get a little rest Brian's courage will go on to replace him and the good blocking by Bob Lingenfelter and Dan Smith number 51 the pulling guard they've already made theirs by the time it goes then ever see Steve Williams number 78 way out in front Richard burrows can't get quite speed going to bring it all away one eye 20 carries 88 yards now pyrin Stewart out of Oxon Hill Maryland here's the deal either he's demotius the Kurdish Pleiades Darrin of the 46 of Texas Tech and quickly let's go to Ron Franklin Earl has an injury report on defensive captain Clete pill and he won't play anymore tonight the trainer says that he was knocked unconscious for just a couple of moments he's okay for friends and family that are watching but he will not be able to play anymore in this ball game tonight hi Ron it's about 7:00 coming up for the brass kill the ball at the 45 of Texas Tech and we're down to two minutes to go in the third quarter Nebraska leading tech 27 to 24 scoring two touchdowns here in the third this is complete on the 30 larry Duprey number 25 had the coverage his son of the former Baylor Drake and Baltimore Colt great LG longgone Duprey and a teammate of Alexander G right after the ballgame gonna have myself a Happy New Year did I hear Larry Duprey at practice here a couple of days ago called you uncle Alex oh you know LG was way way older than I was when I'm class yet Nebraska has done well on 3rd down 8 out of 11 their third and 7 right incomplete flag on the play Pulido is the intended receiver and mic patterns in the left cornerback Asafa more from Wichita Falls is nailed for pass interference one time that the coverage was just a little too good though Mike Patterson was the play group violation but it was enough they'll get six and the ball goes down to the 39 first down where the infraction on a Phoenix Arizona is the referee the officials all the officials are out of the Western Athletic Conference and thank you so much for that seat on our 15th anniversary Gamow pumpkin goes deep Don Roberts head to coverage that time he just intentionally threw that out did not fool Roberts Chuck Milito ran the deep pattern as Ferragamo Ville brought the linebackers in and then let her fly now we're down to a minute twentynine seconds to go in the third quarter Nebraska leading Texas Tech 27 to 24 it is a second and ten for the Cornhuskers on the Texas Tech 39 hitter its dhoti Danelle down to the 35 yard pillbot well and Thomas Howard the allamerican stopped him after a three yard gain everyone looking free there did you pray I must have been a zero at where my number I wonder if that's why he really does work I want to tell you he's not built anything like LG though he really didn't he's a he's got the frame on him LG this small hockey boy he's long lean and ranging he's shown up Texas there's the time in the score 54 seconds to go in the third quarter Nebraska leading Chamblin was there but Roberts had the coverage on him and I think Don Shamblin or rather Dave Chamberlain kind of started running before he made the reception so now it's a fourth down for the Cornhuskers each of the last two drives have been stopped Texas Tech marched on the field went for the field goal in Miss Nebraska has come back to move to the tech 36 and randy lessman is going into punt formation for the Cornhuskers hit midfield Larry ducrai deep he really hangs that one up covered by Nebraska to left alone the hallmark of a well coached football teams gym notice howl at you notice how all those red jerseys whipped to the goal line and face the ball make sure that wouldn't go in the end zone that is a well coached football team when you see things like that presence of mind you know Steve Lindquist is the baby's new down the football Steve is a sophomore from Minneapolis big guys six six 245 boy he's going to be a good one too now 33 seconds remaining and Texas Tech that's in the third quarter Texas Tech has the ball at its own oneyard line Tech land at halftime 17 to 14 wide to the right side go Sammy William rodney Allison the quarterback the hard way a little daylight here the five and Larry Vlasic had the pop after a gain of about three Ted Harvey 31 helped out of the play Larry Isaac number 34 and Billy Taylor 33 boy what a tandem of running backs for Texas Tech time running out in the third quarter now the ball at the five will be second down and seven for Texas Tech and I believe they let the clock run hello Jennifer two seconds one second and there it is so that's the end of the third quarter of play with the score the respite what is it that was that 24 at the end of the third period Nebraska 27 Texas Tech 20 for energy for a strong America that's just half of the tallest offshore platform ever built but it's joined with the other half she'll stand nearly as tall as the Empire State Building and will have cost approximately 70 million dollars to build this platform is a good example of how Exxon is putting its capabilities to work its offshore experience its technical knowhow and its financial resources to provide energy for a strong America when you're my size there's one thing you don't have to worry about Nets getting filled up so a lot of people really surprised when they find out that I drink Light beer from Villa it has onethird less calories in their regular beer and it's less filler but that's now why I drink it I drink Light because I love that taste hey Mac another right like beer from miller everything you always wanted in a beer unless we'll be back with the fourth quarter of tonight's astro Bluebonnet bowl game following station identification this is the TBS television network you fourth water complete on the 16 yard line what free Turner made a fine Benjamin kept one foot in it 11 yards in a first down Dave Butterfield had

him look they haven't seen find that side footlogic and Smith Tim Smith the monster back Larry Vlasic the safety man mailed Alison after a 25 yard pickup is he a determined young man and Kenny run

middle guard the only freshman on the Nebraska team makes the pot for a loss of three from North Platte Nebraska doesn't see much action but he is quick they say is really going to be a good one he shook it loose it is fourth down and six fourth and six for Texas Tech and Kuykendall who was at a fine night of the punting department actually he's kicked twice but he's really boomed him much for run back in the 11 games they played this year they've only returned punts against them for 39 yards Dave Butterfield on the 18 trying to get to the outside goes down and tech carries well now we have

Eibach a yard maybe to Richard Arledge the defensive right in Dairy Milk right makes the stop make the stop brother a gain of one it'll be second down and nine Nebraska has been a very explosive team in all of the third quarters they have played in this year out storing not scoring the competition hundred in 27 to 20 in the third quarter that's fantastic but they've been bad in the fourth quarter the three losses Breton Frasier the safety man and Thomas Howard the linebacker knock him down after an eightyard game babe slow you know I was his first quarterback coach with Atlanta Falcons Mauro I've taught that kid all he knows unfortunately none of it took can you imagine him Bobby Lane in Lubbock Texas together Steve told me the other day you know he said well the hawk probably got me into coaching earlier third down was Nebraska brick burn first down burns goes to the 40 Nebraska is a first down on the Cornhusker 40yard line Don Robert stops him after another nine yard pickup and Rick Burns who has been the leading ground gainer for Nebraska is around that 100yard mark now I don't think we've mentioned in fact West is not playing they're playing without the services of Monty had said he was the number two rusher on the club this year at an operation to his hand I believe arrest for something but he was don't need it at the 41 and Harold Buell 56 and 52 Thomas Howard the allamerican linebacker stopped to play with help from Jim crawled Richard burns 106 yards in 23 carries burns won the starting job because on the end that he got hurt and here he has led Nebraska and rushing 211 yards against Hawaii descended all the time to brass the record for rushing in one game possibly nothing on that one Harrell Buell number 56 the very behind offensive left in stopping the play I can't help but believe that he checked out that tamarod applies there that for someone mister you took an awful lot of time at time looking at that defensive coverage it'll be third down nine yards to go kins faith comes out at tight end mark the frame comes in replacing Milito at the 45 and he took a shot from 59 Gary macwrite the middle linebacker and also Thomas Howard 52 as we mentioned the great allamerican from Lubbock the seniors that's what Texas Tech has on defense they got some exceptional linebacker they do a good job by the way Rick burns going into this game tonight needed 146 yards to reach the 1,000 mark he's on his way Mike Patterson is going deep now for Texas Tech and randy lessman is back to front for nebraska nine 12 left to go on the game nebraska leading by three 27 to 24 things that I not Duty fair catch Texas Tech at the 30yard line Larry Dufresne now that's what I like to see those putts fielder there's no reason the world you see it in the pros a lot they don't handle those balls that bounce anywhere that's good you have to kick a xxx urge there's a time out in the field and the score Nebraska 27 Texas Tech 24 on behalf of the people at the University of Nebraska and all people in the state of Nebraska we want to wish you a happy and a healthy new year thank you Tom Osburn and a happy new year you will be able to through your extension of the contract Rodney Allison of Texas Tech going long semi william across the 45 in a basket eric fortyfour made the tackle on Sammy Williams good adjustment and a good fake their heinous no that's a run all the way down there carries it out about 15 yards before he sits up look at the adjustment that Williams made on the ball there look at that tell me that didn't look like an opportunity and unknown back there watch Williams takes it more to the sideline he was going deeper but he saw blocks you got there move there Sammy Williams gain of 27 yards to the 44 of Nebraska carpet of the strong linebacker who replaced the great Creek bleep pillar makes the watching watch up shut off for a Philips number 80 here braska people said it Phillips couldn't stop that option they might be in trouble and there's Allison showing you that they were exactly accurate at the 32 yard line Texas Tech has the ball here is Brian Hall outstanding at manitech one the curtain tipped award this year great podcaster in the southwest for many many years that's the artificial leg but it doesn't bother him closing quickly at the 28th and Percy Eichelberger the linebacker 44 stops to play after a four yard game I asked Brad Brian Hall about the the wooden leg and all that had affected he's kicking he's attendant allowed his ankle at all Hatta he has a great sense of humor and these are his words he said I never worry about shin splints I only worry about having a bottle of glue with goes to the sidelines doesn't ask for the trainer asked for a carpenter getting warm if they needed second down and five we're talking fortyfour contact quickly at the 25yard line about three grid gas PT 2 is in there both on the Pearl and Alex Hopkins and Ron Franklin with you at the 18,000 extra move on a ball game in Houston Texas in the Astrodome on this New Year's Eve we hope that you're enjoying the evening with us the right side missed the first down it'll be fourth down

fourth down one biggest player the night now for Texas Tech and Rodney Allison wants to talk to Steve Sloan about this decision so there's a timeout on the field in the score Nebraska 27 Texas Tech 24 roses are red violets are blue light beer for Miller I loved you you've got 1/3 less calories in the regular beer and really are less filling which is something to choose but what I liked above all

it 27 and 24 6 26 to go in the game Rodney Allison the crowd standing almost 49,000 air capacity and it's Isaac diving first down so let's go to Billy Taylor beg your pardon he got to and from my vantage point it looks like a first down but they may have to bring the sticks on that one carry wine master the middle guard made the stopper that he fits it into Texas Tech also there was but not much doubt where they're going to go when you got to all conference blockers like Mike there's Sears bad and irons you're gonna run behind wide to the right side comes Nelson Williams left top of the screen first and ten Texas Tech I believe the ball previously been recovered at the 23 we have had some great popping in this game and here's where most of it goes on along that offense and defensive line say what you want to but Vince Lombardi had it pretty simple you block and tackle the win football look at Williams out there getting stood up but he's trying to do his best 10 Harvey putting it on him look at Williams determination that's what makes it go that's Mike's ears on the ground there the ball bounces loose and the recovery by Texas Tech second down 12 after a Lawson well awesome two yards Barry Anderson over the ball awesome screen to militarize it at the 20 well I was right the first time Billy Taylor gain of three Ron hood and George Andrews got the play and it is now third

Clair Pennsylvania the monster man number 14 was in defensively for the undefeated Pittsburgh Panthers and their cheerless turn leaders look like winners don't paternal feels they've got to control the ball when they've got of course it can't be running with on a second time Steve guys Carrie let's hear the backfield of Penn State it produced themselves give yourself a little wanker before a pullback series New York you guys fail back let me through da Athena quarterback and he draws Pennsylvania all right they now have a third down and five at the 29 no score in the game Penn State in the dark blue jerseys seven and three on the year you seem to the quarterback not enough for the first down Steve guys who figured in on all of the snaps was stopped by Leroy Felder and approximately the 34 they needed to get out for the 39 so it's going to be a punting situation in the punt with a 34 and a half yard average the scott Fitzgerald is off to the right of your screen no wind inside Three Rivers Stadium as Willie Taylor number 29 is beat exceeding his average on the year coming way back to the nineteen Willie Taylor folding for a fair tax right team in the nation Pittsburgh hi my name is Greg Joan why are you Steve North to Phil's PA my name is John Hay House were on the offensive tackle from Erie PA hi my name is Matt Carroll I'm not pencil car from inner power high school North PA jompa loosely on the center Youngstown Chaney high school Youngstown Ohio Tom proposed the offensive right guard New Castle Pennsylvania all right from the 18 first and 10 and carrying on the play is the number one runner ever Tony Dorsett lococo Pennsylvania 5:11 192 pounds number 33 you might seem in three different spots the pullback up close to the quarterback for the tailback my mind or perhaps even a wing or a halfback in the split set and the curry was out to the 22 yard line Tony game for its second down at six Dorsett average to get to everybody else's firepower greater that is never good at Penn State quarterback a junior from Youngstown Ohio caught for a loss back to the 20 and let's hear from the backfield of Pittsburgh here they are Willie Taylor wide Steve of running a judge Bob Hutton malwa New Jersey running back Anthony Dorsett running back Aliquippa Pennsylvania that Cavanaugh quarterback Youngstown allowed all right third down and eight for Pittsburgh Cavanaugh to keep other quarterback coming out now to about the 26 they needed eight as short of a first down as Randy Sid ler number 75 in on the tackle for the Nittany Lion defense always considered tough Joe Paterno feels that the way to stop Dorsett is to keep him from going wide they're gonna gamble a little bit on his pretty head shots because they don't think they like to use him that luncheon they will try to keep him from getting the ball wide hairy spider is the punter number six in the country with a forty four point eight a ver agenda was fielded by rich muddy number 48 and approximately the 31 a 39yard punt let's take a break and then we'll return to Pittsburgh back again at Three Rivers Stadium a capacity crowd 55 degrees a light mist falling rained earlier and the evening the field was covered the target turf it's a good condition right now but around 10:00 o'clock Eastern Time heavy rains are expected second time Penn State has had the ball no score first of ten from their own before muddiest cephalo our potential pass procedures the iformation Torian goes to the defect night number 29 and a very fluid and fast moving lateral Pittsburgh defense forces amount of bounces we look at the defensive line Romanowski who played at Hopewell high school with Tony Dorsett Parrish al Romano and Outland Trophy candidate Randy Holloway great sacker in the quarterback Wetherington along with Cramer and Delaney are the linebackers and Wilson jury was seven interceptions number 31 in the backfield has been down at the number 14 you see no on a second and nine covering on the play Bob jury the person we said has seven interceptions coming into the ballgame it was intended for number 21 Tom Donovan so it brings up a third down and nine and a defensive struggle here with no score we have 10 minutes and 55 seconds remaining in the first quarter but Pittsburgh defense is basically a 52 but they changed the alignment all the time and their basic scheme is 250 offensive in opposite all the offensive men to give the linebackers Kramer and motherinfant absolute freedom of movement third Dynamo for Penn State from the 35 completed pass to Nicki Schuler numberone receiver for Penn State with 19 catches and 3 touchdowns blending situation again James Kramer in on the tackle and approximately the 44 voted excuse me because rather unusual thing the number one receiver for his team is the tight end the Schuler or a Penn State and Corbett for Pittsburgh here's the punt our gentle beauty Willie Taylor is deep and he is rubbed down where he caught the last punt from Penn State at the 18 the punt traveled 37 yards there's the ground divided 25 pounds of fries right back again at Three Rivers Stadium ten minutes and 17 seconds remaining in the first quarter there is no score now each team with two possessions second series for Pittsburgh number one and they're back at the 18 after the punt first down and Cavanaugh giving to number 33 Tony Dorsett Dorsett for two or three yards make it three out to the 21 where it'll be second down and seven Ron Crosby on the tackle the Penn State defensive line banks Petruchio Sibley and Crosby number 64 oh just made the tackle those are the linebackers Holloman millon Clark and Hostetler there are two freshmen in the linebacking corps Neal huntin Gary Pat risky so here we go now with a second down and eight the Penn State defense containing Dorsett inside and outside bill banks eightyfive one of the tacklers for the Nittany Lions Tony Dorsett 5.7 average 300 Russia's coming into the game he's a boy of amazing stamina carries the ball a great number of times seems to improve really as the game goes along and so he has thought of going to sort of calm the defensive team they make a tackle for no gain he always says nice dog is going and then he builds up for the breakaway play third down at six and Cavanaugh handled Tony Petruchio was in to stop the quarterback at the 2400 so 3 at his fourth down and nine or the number one ranked team in the country Pittsburgh their last win over Penn State was in 1965 when Frank Clark takes an 18 yard field goal with one second to go Murray sliders Pittsburgh punt is going deep at about the 32 money has it coming out to the 35 and he's dope a 48 yard punt and no return as you see the rain coming down behind the Pittsburgh cheerleaders

to see no 14 the quarterback second and 11 no score first quarter Faith's the challenge Cecil Johnson number 60 was one of the defenders and on Bob touring Penn State press is beginning to change their offensive alignment a little bit they haven't moved the ball yet but each time they jump to a different formation in the house in the press box are reading what the adjustments are by the Pitt Panthers and they hope to be able as soon as they know how they're playing the formations to loosen them up and make some yardage you see a little moisture around the helmet there all right second down a nine for Penn State from their own 36 Bob Tory and Tori brings it out there was a third down play my collection as James Cramer made the stop and again is a punting situation that was the third possession for Penn State Pittsburgh has have two liter team has been able to go beyond either's 40yard line Scott Pitts key will do the punting and deep as Taylor once more let's Keys tikkas inside

the 4 second down and 14 Dorsett now for carries four yards Penn State defense obviously keen on him but as Chris mentioned earlier dorsal will land up and he'll be positioned in the Pittsburgh backfield this time he's a white half back of his rootbeer second 44 Bob Hutton carried on the play and Bill banks in again on the tackle number 85 from Camden New Jersey a junior defensive end 6 1 to 20 I'm very sorry to see it raining out here because the field can get just a little bit slick this is tart from turf but we talked to some of the Pittsburgh Steelers this afternoon Jack ham notably is said that when this field gets wet it does get a little bit slippery and now Tony Dorsett is the tailback to the left of your screen the deepest back on third down and 12 no score tony dorsett stop by bill banks one of the tacklers in on the play along with number 64 Ron Crosby the pinching ends are getting in on number 33 along with 44 hutton going to the far sideline punting time for larry

is from Kentucky played football for a while at Indiana University has often been with us at the booth on the west coast all right number 45 first and ten Penn State carrying on the play Mike cumin a freshman thrown for a loss James Kramer the right linebacker in on the play joined by Jeff Delaney number 14 there's Johnny majors from Lynchburg Tennessee I've been impressed us fire Kris going into the game I thought that Pittsburgh would have a punting advantage spider had a forty four point eight average going into the game in Fitz ki 34.5 a ten point difference but thus far Fitz ki has had the superiority in the kicking eyes a flanker to the near side of the field second 11 from the 46 guy goes in motion toward the backfield on a keeper gesina artificial turf loss back to the 49 a loss of three it will be third down at 14 and Johnny majors after doing a tremendous job at Iowa State getting them back to the thick of the big 8 conference moved to Pittsburgh and the Dukan state is rebuilding the glory days the John Sutherland University of Pittsburgh and before Jack Sutherland long time football fans the incomparable Pop Warner heard down to 14 now for Penn State 4:26 left in the first quarter slop formation you Cena that's by rich muddy inside the 25 of Pittsburgh remember Penn State is a touchdown underdog there is Monty his 11th reception an averaging 14.8 looking for his first touchdown through the air and Chuck is hidden has made the difference in this Penn State attack he's thrown 80 times I competed 80 of 151 rather for 53% of his passing has geared up the attack like last week the first first down but late in the first quarter okay Penn State's 24 Mike cumin cumin for about 2 yards back to the 20 Jeff Zeleny number 14 and Bob jury number 31 cumin 24 another one was great freshmen that your pattern has been talking about he says we've got their young players that I've ever had at Penn State who think back to some of the great ones that he has dad that cappelletti anymore frank O'Hara some of those people he ventures play Mike Goodman carrying on the play one of the many freshmen is bud Wilkinson said and Joe Paterno as usual is showing us many formations many offensive formations guman of Bethlehem Pennsylvania six two and a half 190 pounds Joe Paterno there on the sidelines there he comes into view utter a doctrine of laws from his alma mater Brown University where he was a quarterback his brother George was a fullback coached by ripping goal now it's third down a nine from the 21 go to the screen pass tangent pretty good job at keeping leverage Tori turn it up inside let's watch it again you see the dropping straight back looking to the outside he finds Tori Tori cuts inside the corner man then picks up a devastating wall of blockers down the middle and is home free to the end zone now Tony Capasso Lee number 11 tries to point after it's up and it's good 45 yards and on the sixth play a 21yard touchdown up Tori the sophomore from series New York three minutes and one second left in the first quarter now it's here a comment or two from coach Joe Paterno the pit Penn State game you're gonna see on tonight is the kind of a game we've been hoping for in the East for a long long time we at Penn State have had things pretty much wrong way for a long time and then people like John Major's a Pittenger Eclair burn of Maryland Frank Burns of Rutgers and you concur at Boston College and Walter Navy other people come in put together fine programs a bright energetic coaches and we've got great football in the East now and I think you're gonna see a great football game tonight I think Pitts got an outstanding football team at a number one ranked football team we've got a young upcoming football team and is anxious to take on this challenge of playing a great team I think it's a great game great these really depict and his own that bar a side Wheeling kick that is hard to feel this way inside the 10 and number 44 of Pittsburgh Bob honey saves the day at the one so tough Frank Pittsburgh now will actually move it from the to the ball being spotted at the hash mark and the pressures put on them early with 259 to go in the first quarter Penn State is in the lead the underdog seven to nothing curling stone sliding down there is the way it's living slipped and justified any kind of a popper bounce no way that Pittsburgh ball handlers could get to it they have only gotten to their own 26 us bar in the first quarter and give it to the Orson tony dorsett carrying it for a yard or two number 33 who has to play hurt most of the year because he carries so often and his is the target the sitting or running target of all defensive players 10 has 11 yards rushing Dorsett has eight of those yards 237 to go first quarter Penn State is in the lead seven to nothing to the far side Willie Taylor number 29 we have a second down and eight from the hor Bob Hutton number 44 stop by Randy Seidler number 64 Ron Cosby in on the stop at approximately the six so we're going to have a third down in six so I mentioned earlier Christie of course it's one of those people that kind of lulls you to sleep but if there's no daylight he doesn't really waste himself a great deal but he's got that tremendous wide vision of one there is daylight he simply slept through there he certainly is one that you never know what can overlook on any staff Gordon Jones going out on a path pattern here comes the past was he out of bounds the official said yes he was out of mouths at the Penn State 40 Gordon Joe beautiful throw by Matt Cavanaugh Cavanaugh hit 47 to 76 passes for 62% and the interesting thing to me first of all Cavanaugh he has thrown one interception this season that means that you can throw the ball anyplace but he's not liable to put it up for grabs Bates for Gordon Jones who also returns kickoffs last year he ranked fourth in the nation and this time he moved the ball from his own six to the Penn State 40 54 yards and now Pittsburgh is a much better field position durapan Dorsett is the deep back at the left of your screen he gets the pitch the Berlin lavell three yards perhaps Neal Hutton of man Valley New Jersey and Randy Sadler of Danville Pennsylvania horse Dorset number 33 out of bounds franca watch him Chris Nilan when there's no daylight for him to run he seized everything he floats in there he's always in a good hitting position very well protected and he's just getting his feel of things now and he's talking to the Penn State people about you people are stopping me off me I'll be well and get some loan to sleep that will be the lookout there's a man that's had three perfect season Joe Paterno coach of the year in 1968 Pittsburgh second and seven from the 37 Cavanaugh Jones is out Jones the pass was short because the rush was tremendous number 75 Randy Seidler put the rush on Matt Cavanaugh a junior quarterback from Youngstown Ohio so it'll be a third down and seven the ball at a Penn State 37 the Nittany Lions lead 7 to nothing if you just joined us a few minutes ago they went 45 yards and on the sixth play a 21 yard touchdown pass Lucina to Bob Tori Gordon Jones and Willie Taylor set away from the line on a 37 Cavanaugh wants to hit one of them best masterpiece in the world Jody ng number 97 in on the play disappointed Matt Cavanaugh but here is a procedure penalty against Pittsburgh excellent rest that time by Penn State this however I think Cavanaugh will begin to read that he'll begin to drop it off short when they bring the extra man up to put on the six and seven man rush as they did in the previous play parcel penalty declined bringing up a fourth down at 12 and Larry spider now don't have as much field to work with Walt Brown steps the ball to spider it's low angling for the corner to official I will line it up and let's see it'll be a touchback coming out to the 20 Penn State in the lead some of the nothing with a minute 19 to go in the first quarter will snap it from their own 20yard line Joe Paterno a native of Brooklyn New York won ten years in a row against the Pittsburgh Panthers never been defeated by a Pittsburgh team and tomorrow here on ABC Sports you'll be treated to another NCAA football doubleheader 12:30 Eastern Time 11:30 Central it's additional battle of the service academies the armynavy game from Philadelphia then for the Los Angeles Coliseum the Fighting Irish a Notre Dame take on the second ranked bhajans of USC cephalo in motion from the twenty first and ten carrying the ball Mike guman the freshman number 20 for the backfield guman 24:39 Tori cephalo the flanker rich Monte the split end number 48 the tight end is Mickey Schuler number 82 Dean of one yard on the play there's a close up of Tony Dorsett just waiting very knighting his time because sooner or later he'll rip one second down to nine Penn State lady 7a nothing 46 seconds first quarter and guman getting a workout 190 pounder charges out to about the 25 James Cramer number 58 and 59 Arnie Wetherington the linebackers take a look at Anthony Dorsett as a youngster as seven years of a son of Myrtle and West Dorset recently Tony says we should pronounce his name Dorsett however too many people know it the other way Crispin time to change it too late his parents know it Dorsett 35 now for Penn State gesina mic guman the intended receiver and again it'll be hunting time for the Nittany Lions who lead seven to nothing with only two seconds left on the Three Rivers Stadium clock Penn State is going against a very experienced fiveman defensive line and linebackers six of the Pittsburgh front seven if you want to call him that our seniors and one of them is a junior Holloway their right tackle scott Fitzgerald grant Lyon Pennsylvania and exceeding his average on each kick as Willie Taylor looks at at the 35 tries to break away but number 85 build banks in on the tackle for the Nittany Lion see is that great defensive end or the Nittany Lion defense the quarter is ended here Penn State surprising leading Pittsburgh seven to nothing but the referee Paul brother look like our puffing cuddly but unusual cig yeah I kind of hit the front of his little leg think it was trippin Kristi will be back but first let's hear from one of our sponsors that makes this telecast possible from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania none tight Pittsburgh a clipping call a dead ball foul we'll have them move the ball from their own 18 it's one of the worst penalties you can get Chris because you start first in twenty five instead of first and ten yes a floating occurs while the balls in play then it's first through 10 that ball clipped it just really puts you in tough shape all right Matt Cavanaugh the quarterback Dorsett the deep bag Cavanaugh no keeper Cavanaugh in 18 out to about the 23 Ron Crosby number 64 in on the tackle the first quarter statistics but Walker's in there very very close 65 total yards 274 time of possession NATO three to six 57 and that's the one that Joe Paterno's looking at they can keep possession of the ball the majority of the game he thinks they've got an awfully good shot at it all right second down and long yardage because of that foul Jones and Taylor sent away good baking by dorsum has told the end and Randy Seidler are in on number 12 Matt Cavanaugh and from the 24 the ball will come back to the 23 where will be I a third down and approximately 20 at Cavanaugh Youngstown Ohio he crushed the ball the 345 yards scored four touchdowns this year he is one of five on third conversions here's a big one disciple they call out of four for defense but the way Joe Paterno makes us of ethics for for sometimes it's 71 sometimes it just keeps pouring into they've guessed right every time they've blitzed north and 27 spiders kick fair catch call 4i riched money seven by Spyder and now Penn State betterthanaverage field position at their own 38 first down high school athletes will attract five million participants this year nearly 50% of the student body of most schools and be involved in the inner scholastic program the National Federation of State High School Associations request your support for this important part of a school program Penn State's Chuck casino calling signals ladies seven to nothing opening moments of the second quarter Wilson Wilson has a quarter he's in Italy see Wilson dropping back he was the perfect position to make the play let's take another look at it straight drop back pass ball thrown and it's a little bit of a hanger as you can see not enough speed on it let Wilson cut back in front of it he makes a very good return here for about 14 yards moving all the way across the field picked up some good blocks I hope field position now okay but on the 44 46 make up to 44 first and ten short pass intended for number 81 Jim Corbett who had 30 catches coming into the ballgame including two touchdowns 81 he's from Erie Pennsylvania a battle for recruiting here in this state between these two schools is ferocious but in the roster and the majority the players are from Pennsylvania it also makes a difference who wins this game every would like to be able to winner Pittsburgh can break through tonight that'll make easier for Johnny to continue this fine recruiter Cavanaugh Pittsburgh rather indecisive which is unlike Kavanagh but the Penn State defense is so mobile that they'll cause you to make the wrong decisions however Cavanaugh did kept from his own 44 to the 38 a gain of six third down at four very good shot there Chris of how Penn State's gonna play that wide option or any kind of a sleep they had two people on the outside of Cavanaugh waiting for the ball to go to Dorsett because they do not want to give him any sliver of room ball 27 left in the first half Penn State seven Pittsburgh nothing they have the ball go ahead prior to the football and pittsburgh completion did he have inside the 35 watch it again number 81 4bit 64 210 pounds senior and Johnny major said before the game he has never seen Corbett drop a ball he made the cat she dropped an after he was hit but the referee ruled that the plane was dead that he had been stopped prior to the fumble and Pittsburgh is now beginning to ignore Dorsett a little bit they realize that Penn State is keying everything on Tony and they're using him to fake and they've begun to move the ball a little bit with that strategy all right let's take a look at it again and be sure that the officials called it correctly there he's made the reception he's hit and now he's being driven back before he fumbled the ball at least that was the interpretation from the umpire first downs have been scared there's another one by Pittsburgh the Thunder old from the Penn State 34 Tony Dorsett carries for a yard or two and Randy Seidler number 75 what a defensive game he is having at the offensive right tackle and it just seems to know where Dorsett is going or any of the ball carriers so with all now at the 33 is the second down and nine Penn State leads they went 45 yards and on the sixth play at 21 yard touchdown pass you seen it about Tory point after seven to nothing second a nine Pittsburgh Rick Thomason a freshman Dunkirk New York was in a Cavanagh pass so Penn State takes over at its own eight eleven twenty two remaining in the first half Penn State leading Pittsburgh seven to nothing I think you can gather the intensity the sellout crowd equally divided 25,000 bridge school here in our broadcasting booth above Three Rivers Stadium it's tremendous and they traded intercepted Chris with the same kind of throws that ball Kavanagh simply doesn't grill it quite hard enough Donaldson is only a freshman as you pointed out when we see him here a turning man great speed ball just a little bit under thrown floated just a little bit Donaldson coming back in front of the play to make the key interception so the two teams have traded interception now field position of all testamental of the penn state office Matsui and his brother Larry suing they'll 32 and 35 from the 8th who's seen as a quarterback giving to Matsui who is the freshman brandy Holloway in on the tackle and there is a loss on the play back to the 6 run will be second down and 12 for the Nittany Lions it's a great family for Penn State the three Suey brothers of the team call Larry and Matt there are the sons of Steve Tsui who was an allamerican under Bob Higgins at 1947 at Penn State and Bob Higgins is their brain father okay second down to 12 from the 62 Cena trying to get the band over the bar corner to knock it off at least to survive and press this pickle is right it was the first band playing against the Penn State quarterback and so he carried from the six on a second and 12 thus far heads Byrd has 19 total rushing yards Penn State went that carry out to approximately the nine has 11 I don't know what that's to do a great deal fist of the slipperiness of the turf I think most of it was due to the excellent in preparation both these teams have had they've had the two weeks practically to get ready to play and that does give you what a coach loves a little more time for a key game when your players want to be ready 39 in the backfield Chuck cocina covered the ball and it brings up a fourth I think we may see some change of cleats here in the second half an artificial turf most teams play with the sort of soccer peg like cleats but this field has to be slippery enough but I think we'll get some of the oldfashioned turf please put on big rush 10ton ready to go Willie Taylor is deep for Miss America tough brush put on him Fitz key gets it off a fair catch call for my Willie Taylor no wind tonight still misting and the spot now the snap for the Panthers will come from the Penn State 41 first this great Vegas and again CAA football doubleheader beginning at 12:30 Eastern Time the armynavy game live from Philadelphia then at 4:00 o'clock eastern time notre dame battles USD to preach traditional rivalries tomorrow on ABC number one ranked Hesburgh now field position at the Penn State for 41 Penn State leading 7 to nothing 924 preventing in the first half Cavanaugh faking a handoff faking a pass and her keeper built banks was not fooled as we go down to Steve Zabriskie thank you Chris Jim Corbett's wrist has been bandaged originally he cut it and it appeared that he aggravated it on the artificial surface or else someone had stepped on it with their rubberized cleats and torn the cut open a little bit we're not sure whether he hit it on somebody's head gear or just how he cut it but it appears to be just a cut it's bandaged he's back in the game and he should be alright we'll have to wait and see if it'll affect is receiving however okay Chris thanks Dave second down and eight now from the 39 a bullet first and when you've got everybody up there Chris ready to stop Dorsett and you better have some linebackers ready if you're gonna stop Dorsett there just isn't a lot of help in the secondary as you can see beautiful throw here have you seen a man wide open because the linebackers were up protecting against Dorsett and Gordon Jones makes a beautiful night Taylor now going to the far side as a flanker first and ten from the Penn State 13 Pitts deepest penetration Dorset and Dorsett or a couple of yards Ron Crosby forcing him out along with Rick Donaldson number 92 earlier had an interception for the Penn State defense and averaging a hundred seventy two point four yards per game but up to now Tony Dorsett has been really contained yes now a total of 23 yards but it's early 8:20 to go in the first half Penn State leading 7 to nothing Joe Paterno said we're not gonna make any yards wide second down and eight now or Pittsburgh Berger Sparsit he went wide to the six going lateral with him bill banks the defensive left in number 85 Daria's we're going to get some kind of misdirection for Pittsburgh pretty soon if the defense is truly flowing very very rapidly with the birth date at least Tony's longest game on the play a gain of five yards so it's third down and three or the Panthers nurse it lines up now the righthalf back in the splint back formation for coats Johnny majors the referee Paul Bertha who works for the Allegheny County official 'dom his referee here the best of these veteran and impartial also kristef he's the public official 733 to go in the first half penn state seven that's for nothing guys converted t of a third downs here's a third and three at the six good Dorsett has six points his teammates love him here's a 20th rushing touchdown of the by way of the passages moved in a very good play here by Cavanaugh he held the ball slowed up just enough to let Dorset get a far enough ahead of him that when the ball was tossed out his superior speed made it a little bit of a slow up right there you can see the toss and there's that great speed turning it on inside the flag for the store and again field position Penn State scored from the pittsburgh 45 on the sixth play now get 41 yards on the fifth five or six scores and the point after attempt by carson lung as good as tied was seven 18 to go in the first half tony dorsett has scored his 54th career touchdown battling for the Highsmith trophy to be awarded on Tuesday there is Carson long who will kick as we have a tie game at 77 18 to go in the first half rich money is deep for Penn State there at the left of your screen at about the tree and moving forward Scott Witzke who is the punter and a flanker is to the near side of the field and Tom Donovan an end is to the opposite side Carson long has teed it up on the far hash mark no wind affecting the kicks that is still missing here buddy has it the third team coming out to about the 20 and look at the number seven coming up with the ball round still you saw him holding high over his head what's money now at the 13 coming forward the hits were hard one that ball up in the air Chris for maybe six or seven seconds it wasn't a deep kick down only about the 15yard line but that gives you that excellent excellent coverage Pittsburgh now has the ball in the 20 their last three exchanges they've got it on the 44 of the 40 and now the 20 of Penn State the old Bugaboo the mistakes now the 20 Pittsburgh Kevin although he hurt his hand is in a quarterback and Omaha quick late Dorsett most two about the 17 as we go to the sidelines and Steve Zabriskie Matt Cavanaugh is a 5th quarterback has injured the little finger on his left hand it is not his throwing hand they don't think it's dislocated they tape the two together the one next to it and a little finger on his left hand and then they had him soaking his finger in a bag of ice and then that fumble happened he had to go right back out of the field it shouldn't be any problem however Chris second down to 6 from the 16 Dorsett garsik with a slight straight arm at number26 Neal Hutton of Mount Holly New Jersey of jr. when he saw it wouldn't work he just goes out about his Dorset before that Carrie that was his 13th carry by the way from the 16 the ball gets to the 12 so he now has 35 yards and one touchdown that last play gives you some idea though why of course it has the tremendous statistics and why is the leading candidate for the Heisman Trophy he's running about threequarter speed but everybody else is running full speed and then he can turn on another 25% 32 for the Panthers he took a step and a half and number 53 Kurt Alderman the senior linebacker made a beautiful defensive play back at the 14 it's fourth down and four let's see if Carson long jumps into the lineup Armen have been an outside linebacker for Penn State to fire to this game they moved him to the inside because Joe Paterno was concerned about having three freshmen inside from the 21 plus the 10 of the end zone on an angle 31 yards one of the alltime great college kickers it's long enough so 553 remaining in the first half doors still Pittsburgh seven Penn State seven here is a replay of a 31yard field goal attempt by Carson law and you can take a look at it two camera angles were sometimes deceiving but you see a little cheering from Carson long the officials now are checking it out it was very very close but the officials are looking at it from all angles not from a camera angle and they said it was wide and they have the final site yes it does not make any difference its record 553 to go on the first half you just joined us and the state scored in the first quarter 45 yards on the sixth play at 21 yard touchdown tore a pass thrown by Christina Dorsett scored for Pittsburgh to tie it up down from the 20 penn state steve dice carries on the play another steve is on the sideline misters The Frisky Pittsburgh thank you Chris Carson long as many of you may remember who saw this game last year here in Three Rivers Stadium was kind of the goat he missed three fourth quarter field goals that would have given Pitt the win over Penn State they lost that game to the Disney Lions seven to six tonight Carson long hits his first attempt and that builds up confidence right there could be a big difference as we get later in the game Chris so now with the ball at their 24 it's a second down and six for Penn State slot formation to the far side let's play a double wing formation and Bob Torre who scored the Penn State touchdown carries on the play on Ernie Wetherington number 59 of Miami Florida made the stop and let's see the forward progress to the 28 gain of four will be third down and two I've got a feel Chris that fake percentages work out for a skill goal kicker as good as long he's an alltime scorer as a kicker in NCAA history he's an excellent excellent player give it another shot I got believe you'll put it through their time has been called down on the field Penn State as 20 yards rushing on 16 plays but what counts is a 21 yard pass play for their touchdown as we look at Johnny majors in his fourth year here at the University of Pittsburgh brought them from losers to winners let's hear what he has to say we inherited the football program that had really learned to accept defeat as a way of life and that their players and the fans and everybody else I think accepted it and we're learning to lose and the first thing we try to do is instill into our people not to learn to lose or accept losing as a way of life to learn though play light winters and to play with pride and enthusiasm regardless how bad you look for how bad you were then you could get better we recruited a good bunch of freshmen to go along and mix in with the senior holdovers and juniors who were hungry and we're tired of being embarrassed this group of people molded into a group who at one time maybe cared little for each other individually or collectively to a group name who really loved each other as corny as it may sound and respect each other's a team first an individual second Johnny majors an allamerican at Tennessee in 1956 second and the Heisman Trophy voting that year second Paul Hornung now it's a third down to two for Penn State at the 28 scores tied seven run by Steve guys it's kind of a play to beat Pittsburgh last year when its third down and short Chris you've gone to some kind of a goal line defense and if they pop one it may go all the way which is how Penn State put their six points on the board and the successful point after made the 76 win for them Penn State on their last six games needing Stanford first then losing to a how state Iowa and the Kentucky or how they've come back in her they improved from the 35 first down Steve dice again Steve brings it out to his own 44 for a nine yard gay then Jeff Delaney on the tackle once you insert a moment ago Chris to me I think people have talked for years about what a great coach Joe Paterno is when you win one and then you lose three you can see everything sort of just draining out on here but he had the courage as a coaching with his staff to put the new young players in and this team has truly come to life he has all made four seniors on the offensive team two seniors on the defense so look out the future on a second and one Bob Torre who scored the Penn State touchdown on a pass from Fusina carried Dorsett scored the pittsburgh touchdown on a beautiful move of six yards to the outside and now with the ball at the 44 it's going to be a third down on one firemen's one flashback at halftime highlights of the Nebraska Oklahoma game what a game the Sooners coming from behind to win it 22:17 boomer sooner but Wilkinson last drive in from the past Preston came back a little box up these old P flickers to win the game Penn State needs a yard and they got Steve guys our tough producer on the ground gets it right near midfield so Penn State keeps the drive alive on the clock three minutes remaining in the first half the score is tied at 7 guys now 33 yards in seven carries the Penn State offense is beginning to pick up a little bit of momentum they were unable to move the ball at all in the ground in the first quarter they did the very effective throwing you seen a is an excellent passer but now they're beginning to put it together on the ground Donovan 21 cephalo 34 on a first contender in the midfield stripe kutina looking at both third down out they go pass over the head of 44 cephalo Bob curry covering here against Steve Zabriskie Franco Harris of the Pittsburgh Steelers one of the great running backs in Penn State history Franco you played it a couple of these games you enjoyed it very much you know like one time I was playing there wasn't such a really big deal to play you know he's competing pretty bad but now fit be a number one and benefit being the underdog it's quite a thrill you can start by just being here in a stadium thanks a lot Franco let's go back up to Chris casino five of nine passing just the guy's face gets to them Courtney very very close to another first down who's seen a 509 64 yards and a touchdown great execution and blocking of a wall a second item tailing the event was expecting to pass good call great execution guys scored a 29yard touchdown last year eight minutes remaining in the fourth quarter and what the point after was a margin of victory for Penn State third down and one yoshino once at all cuts it out here 82 Mickey Schuler his tight end first down for the Nittany Lions there at bay Pittsburgh 33 you see this very cool operator about there he think that sewer was his number two receiver as we see him coming back Bank inside the guys he's rolling to his left he turns sets he's rifled and the pressure is on him you can put it right in there Schuler turn made the nice reception he's from McKees Rocks Pennsylvania handing off to number 39 Bob Corey Akilah rocks Pennsylvania also the hometown of other Penn State quarterbacks Hufnagel Burkhardt Joe Paterno felt that they could move the ball against this Pittsburgh defense even though Pitt is ranked number one in the country it felt quite solidly that after they knew where they were that they could get off the line of scrimmage move the ball effectively but the ball now at the 30 it'll be a second down at seven with a minute 38 remaining in the first half Pittsburgh 7 Penn State 7 Pittsburgh favored by about a touchdown here on their final regular season game but what's happening Monday night well this Monday night on ABC's NFL Monday Night Football a Minnesota Vikings will be in Candlestick Park to play the San Francisco 49ers last weekend the rankings prinster it set the Novation title in nine years the bank these questions of course will be guided by quarterback Fran Tarkenton who holds nearly all of the NFL's career passing records the 49ers have a so much younger quarterback but wellknown Jim the Plunkett the 1970 Heisman Trophy winner who done so well in his six years in the NFL for the fifth week in a row ABC Sports is you were looking at a divisional leader the Minnesota Vikings by the San Francisco 49ers on NFL monday night football at nine o'clock Eastern Time 8:00 central over most for these ABC stations well there they are well that's the pass law regard to mr. Bassman second 287 it's not Halloween from the 30 now time running out in the first half the 30th Pittsburgh the reverse Tom Donovan Troy and intercepted by Jeff Zeleny excellent defensive play they had all the razzle downs that you can have Chris but he puts Berg defense was cool back there at two men on the ball it was a little bit under thrown that cuts them off the hook and prevents the field goal second interception on Penn State and with the ball at the 8th the Panthers have a minute 29 to try to break the 7 to 7 tie the 76 renewal of a rivalry that began in 1893 and for the third year this has been a Pennsylvania spectacular here at Three Rivers Stadium we've been there hall three years and these games have been something number twelve in a quarterback time music he was out of bounds Chris good reception but the Jones the feeling was too quite wide enough for him this is the first time that Tom music has been correction Cavanaugh is the quarterback Meyer and he does hang it out there very well Jones makes the reception but as you can see his foot comes down of the field of play time left a minute 22 here in the first half to score tied 77 Taylor 29 to the far side that's why he's a career rushing record holder Tony Oh Nate out to the 30 I was gonna say Christopher out you wouldn't expect his team to score with so little time left if they didn't have a man named Tony Dorsett number 33 he just reads it kind of glides through their revenge a great deal of OJ Simpson watching one yard right down the middle and they are at the Penn State 43 first down 52 seconds left in the first half and Cavanaugh is a cool customer he was rushed he rolled out he hit Jones on the crossing pattern don't paint the reception and he's a fine runner he picked up good extra yardage 28 yards on the play Gordon Jones a southpaw of North Versailles Pennsylvania and they're 52 seconds on the clock believed that the Pittsburgh has two timeouts remaining so that will give them I think ample time at least to get the field goal range Cavanaugh now has thrown eight times completing four for a hundred and twelve yards the Pittsburgh touchdown was scored by Tony Dorsett on a 66 yard outside run Penn State's touchdown was a 21yard combination Fusina to Bob Tory thus the 7 to 7 Ty Jones has three catches for 107 yards and this is the type of situation that puts the pressure on young freshman Penn State has three freshmen playing linebacker for the number 92 Donaldson number 54 Clark and number 60 millon fiftytwo seconds remaining in the first half that is Jones 24 Taylor 29 left and right Dorset and Hutton are the setbacks Cavanaugh out goes Jones flying he had beaten the defender Neal Hutton number 26 the pass was long Kavanagh proved to us that he could throw at least 53 yards Wow second down and 10 Clark stopped 47 seconds left in the first half Cavanaugh statistics just repeat them one more time he is hitting 62% of his passes going to his game and throw only one interception this season but he did throw another one in this game outcome of this game annually is for bragging rights by either Penn State or Pittsburgh you can brag a little bit this movie about a national championship all right certainly supremacy in the East game on the independence Jones and Taylor potential receivers it goes to Darcy who breaks one that loses a yard Tony petruchio number 99 the Levittown Pennsylvania and Bill banks 85 of Camden New Jersey on the tackle at the 44 third down and 11 40 seconds left on the clock here at Three Rivers Stadium home of the Steelers and the Pirates and once a year spot for this game Penn State and Pittsburgh this year Pittsburgh Panthers are the visiting team they alternate of course Penn State has done a great job of defensing anything that straight ahead Chris the misdirection plays and the crossing patterns have been the key ways the Pittsburgh to move the ball against the Nittany Lions got a big week of football on ABC two more tomorrow armynavy at 12:30 followed by Notre Dame southern california the trojans ranked number two now third down 11 score tied Cavanaugh Taylor diving forward he receives it and approximately the 33 hill crummy covering defensively so that let's see if there was enough for a first down it was the third down and 11 it's very very close a measurement called poor that's a gratuitous timeout for Pittsburgh referee kills the clock for them here that give them time to go back in the huddle get settled and then come up I don't think that they have called their third timeout all right they head linesman and his crew clifford fair former basketball official retired from that longtime football official these are the Pittsburgh Panther assistant coaches after are right there busy throughout the game that's the brain trust one of the worst places to see if football game is where the head coach stands down on the sidelines because your perceptions were all wrong the staff up above in the press box can really key the movements of the players both down and less than the length of a football we have 25 seconds left in the first half the score tied at 7 Penn State scored in the first quarter Pittsburgh and they're on a keeper Cavanaugh gets the first down 20 seconds on the clock here at Three Rivers Stadium in the first half time called by the Pittsburgh Panthers unbeaten and untied first time since 1937 and I believe that's their third and final time out of this hat and when they snap it but they'll do it from about the hash mark of 32 Jude Cavanaugh a little bit of slippery turf out there number 95 come to pass Oh of White Plains New York a junior linebacker shooting the gap and it comes back to the 41 and Cavanaugh trying to stop the clock no time left so here at Three Rivers Stadium the impact the teams crisscross at 2:00 are left with the score tied at 7 let's go down to Steve Zabriskie John Major's anything surprise you're the first half not already I expect your pen steady to get asked for socks they are and both defenses are playing a great ballgame so hard for ball game and we've got to maybe put the ball in here a little mortal form offbalance and they're getting afters very well and both teams are it's it's a help a ball game and it's wide open for this point anybody can win the game do you think hosted in the beginning field position makes a big difference I think games every time the game field position first three or four times we're changing balls yes it's a big Packard always isn't football all right coach good luck to you in a second every day what do you anticipate I anticipate the same hard part battle hope you can loosen him up son we gotta get our offensive line cranked up keep them out of our backfield and give us a little more time that's one thing are we gonna have a difficult role all right good luck people coach thank you yes and it continues to mister maybe our pal and native of Pittsburgh Erroll Garner thought of it when he wrote the tune misty we'll be back with a lot of action after this one looks so busy before you do can I make a suggestion just Manning skin bracer aftershave it's got a nice clean smell not to perfume me it won't arrive before you do Thanks this company needed that sidelines with coach Joe Paterno coach anything surprise you about the first half well I'm really pleased Oh what we play defensively I didn't think we could maybe stay too long I will just point we haven't thrown a ball better I have to throw Bannock we're gonna win this football game that I'm sure that trouble container that guy's much longer he's a great backhand anyway any play can explore it on you so we gotta get some point okay coach what about the field position in the first step you think that was a surprising they're kicking game Wow okay close paternal with this players on the sidelines getting ready they're happy about getting ready for the second half of they're happy to be tied here seven seven with Pittsburgh Penn State said that they didn't think of themselves as being the underdog in this game and they're proving perhaps they are not let's go upstairs to Kristen but thank you very much Steve and but here are the first half statistics and Pittsburgh having a little bit the best of it they're passing particularly effective Joe Paterno just mentioned that they've got to do better with their passing the time of possession is key and in the second quarter Penn State had the ball only six minutes and 14 seconds they dominated ball possession in the first quarter which is why they controlled Pittsburgh so effectively ball position is gonna be the key so if you're just joining us here for wedding the start of the second half that is mat bar number 10 that will be kicking into Pittsburgh when the first half ended Pittsburgh had the ball after an interception they moved from the 8 to the 32 now deep we have Willie Taylor 29 23 is Larry sentence for the Panthers score tied at 7 Taylor at the 3 5 10 15 20 falls forward to the and the unbeaten and untied Pittsburgh Panthers ranked number one since November 15th well try to move it from approximately their own 25 touchdowns first Bob Torre a 21 yard pass from Chuck Ducey no the Penn State quarterback in the first quarter and Dorsett kept the 41 yard march going outside a six yard run for the score 7 to 7 as Taylor comes to the near side Jones goes out sit criminy lit the 26 Cavanaugh number 12 ripping one out to Jones he tried to make a 90degree turn and move up failed was forced out by Rick Donaldson one of the many freshmen on the Penn State defense in retrospect fear one of the key plays in the first half but after Pittsburgh toward their touchdown on the following kickoff Penn State Hummel in their own 20 Pittsburgh was unable to move the ball and they narrowly missed a field goal had they stored their two successful possessions it might have given them a medal that they're seeking both sides cheering now it's a second down and six from the 30 Pittsburgh and white Cavanaugh it was trailing on the play a gain of a yard so it'll be a third down and five and let's meet the Pittsburgh offensive units here they are hi my name is grill Jones why we feel north to Phil's PA my name is John hazard on the offensive tackle from Erie PA my name is Matt Carroll I'm not the car from unibrow high school north PA jompa loosely on the center I'm from Youngstown Chaney high school Youngstown Ohio Congress those the offensive right guard Newhouse defense women five horse comes outside in the first half he had 51 yards on 16 carries and one touchdown he needs 91 yards here in the second half too magic six thousand yard March he kept the first down for the Panthers and it kind of bewildered at how he did that chrisser didn't appear to be any daylight at all but he saw that little seam used up great extra birth to speed that reserved that he always has to his fuller forward for the first time seven yard carry first and ten from the 38 with the ball in their own territory caminar well hard hit out of bounds at the 42 Kurt alderman number 53 forcing him out now let's hear from the Pittsburgh backfield Willie tell the wives Steve of running in choice Bob Hutton mall WA New Jersey running back Anthony Dorsett running back a local Pennsylvania Matt Cavanaugh quarterback Youngstown Ohio Matt now is up the line second down and five from his own 43 the score tied at 7 Bob Hutton 44 carrying out to the 46 gain of three it'll be third down and two Ron Crosby on the tackle for Penn State seven to seven the score 13:48 remaining in the third quarter the Jenny majors has had Dorsett lined up at four different positions in the backfield thus far he's at either halfback on the veer he took one step from the fullback position in the eye and then several from the tailback position in the I formation they try to hide him a little bit but Penn State has found him effectively thus far that's fair 32 Evon all average four nine rushing this year four touchdowns on the ground number 12 Cavanaugh the junior from Youngstown Ohio the ball is near midfield and one of the things fish you always have to do a football game to take what they are willing to give you obviously they are not willing to let Dorsett have much room to run with Cavanaugh going out on the various option plays when they're defending well against Dora said he's got some room now joseph is the tailback at the right of your screen the back button is ahead of him Thank You Garcia here's the pass the big rush put on by 85 bill banks pass intended for Willie Taylor and let's up the Penn State defense they have held a team that's averaged 33 points to only seven in the first half Penn State defense which includes Bill banks who's been in a lot of defensive plays number 85 petruchio Seidler and Ron Crosby was in on the last play all in the millon and Clark the two freshman linebackers and Hostetler and in the secondary we have puttan Peter cuskey and Bernie Robinson now a second intent Jim Carbon coach Hoffman said never drops the ball so does his gray pan I didn't believe Johnny majors when he told me that that he's never seen Jim Corbett drop a ball just gives you some idea that he was telling the truth he kind of makes the fakeblock their screens is Man number 85 banks the ball appeared to be overthrown he went up busted off his hands made a great perception and now it's third down and about two Cavanaugh now is completed 7 of 14 134 yards timeout has been taken by the topranked Pittsburgh Panthers here in Pennsylvania we're going to take a break and then back to more action don't go away like a try ball is very important here's a little thing that Tom Brennan is using behind a Penn State bench to keep the ball as dry puts it in looks like a rotisserie little electric heat and the ball goes around and around like a dryer and keeps the drive back to you Chris okay 33 for Cavanaugh first down the Corbett Panthers now their own 26 they have moved to the 35 a Penn State first down good pressure again but Cavanaugh throws a beautifully Taylor had driven the corner man back corbett came out the front of the corner man was hip hard as he made the reception but once again as we see him goes suresure hands taylor down the field driving the quarter man back linebackers not able to get out there quite fast enough that was to Paso chasing him first down Pittsburgh as Johnny major said at the end of the first half they'd have to pass more Hutton keeps it on the ground on a first down play for five hardearned yards 85 banks 97 Jodie Angie in on the tackle so it'll be a second and five here in the third quarter 11:55 remaining the scores tied 77 and this is what Joe Paterno did not believe Pittsburgh could do he said they're a big play team if we can keep from making the big play I don't think they can March to effectively against us down the split backs corset for the farside Kevin on a keeper trailing his corset here he is no chance the flick was hi Rick Donaldson 92 the freshman from Dunkirk New York along with Ron Crosby in on Tony Dorsett and he said well and everybody to sleep as he wandered back to the Hubble looking like he's very very tired but he's got great stamina but that ball moves emus circus player and later with the Browns and Cleveland used to do that to me Brown and then look out and most of the good ones do good they kind of lull you to sleep and then light the fuse alright a loss of two third down and seven Cavanaugh three turnovers for Penn State to the Pittsburgh Zoo odmg intercepts at the 20 the Nittany Lions tie ballgame will take over but first this pause from Three Rivers Stadium berg had a great great drive going and on third and seven this happened to Cavanaugh Cavanaugh rolling out he tries to force this just a little bit he had a little opening could've run the ball was thrown and a very fine interception by gonzo set the play up and drive apart and Penn State takes over nice their top pressure brings it out to about the 35 and I'm hardhitting football game here at Three Rivers Stadium out of the 35 it's a first and ten as Dorsett looks on perspiring heavily Lynn Swann graduate of Southern California the first agree starter the Pittsburgh Steelers is here fellow broadcaster when were you rooting for tonight well I'm rooting for both teams but deep down inside I know if it Lewis's s he has a chance to be number one in the nation o nsz of firstplace voted I am to be seen here at 4:00 Eastern Time tomorrow we're glad you're out here watching the game and I know you're high on Gordon Jones when Jones have a fantastic ballgame they kept 20 Dorsett pretty much in check so he's been doing a super job of helping the team move the ball down the field ok lanes hang around Lynn Swann of the Steelers we have a penalty here a little bit of a mixup in the timing and illegal procedure penalty against Penn State they went on a very quick count 14 was not quite ready for the snap signal when it was called by piscina so the first down up at the 35 it comes back to the 30 where it will be first down and shucks casino has won touchdown pass to his credit cephalo in motion number 44 exit out 15 yard gain it will be second down and two James Wilson on the tackle or the Pittsburgh Panthers Bob Torre now 5 carries 23 yards the Pittsburgh defenses we take a look at it there has been covering everybody in the offensive line they haven't been running the trap plays but the last two traps that Penn State has run and broken the wide wide open tandem I second and to Penn State know these guys no running room James Cramer in on the play along with number 35 Dave the CCO and Wetherington number 59 so loss of one yard on the play it's third down and three for the Nittany Lions score tied 77 909 left in the third quarter four of ten on third downs for Penn State cephalo 44 motion these guys first down for the mini lions at the 47 and I believe the man of motion and the various formations defense stated you team are beginning to upset the Pittsburgh defense a little bit they've been in 14 different sets if you count them going from left to right in the various distances that the men have been going in motion which requires an accurate adjustment by the defensive team they've guys 62 yards and 10 carries Tony Dorsett watching scores tied at 77 first and 10 from their own 47 Penn State Xena for Penn State turnover Lucina tried to hit rich Monti and it's another interception in profile jury his eighth of the year tying a Penn school record you can see how far across the field he came cutting across getting in the line of flight making a good run down the sidelines a 27yard returned by jury and his percent is 830 steps into the year time Billy Reynolds who did it in 1954 the Panthers now back to back interception the Panthers have it here their own 40 first down score tied at 7 Dorsett looked like he had a step but it closed the door number 92 Rick Donaldson here's Pittsburgh Steve Zabriskie I was talking to Bobby mango at the 5th quarterback who was injured in the Georgia Tech game this year he was in the locker room at halftime he said coach majors told his team we're better than Penn State all we have to do is not lose our poise it's a tight game and mistakes are gonna make the difference he exhorted his team to do what he believes and they believe they can do all right Chris second down and six gar\u00e7a for yards he has the ball again speed 40 r44 consistently and you saw a little bit right there as he gets him to Penn State Territory at the 49 a gain of six Bertoni and let's say it's a first down for Pittsburgh and Dorsett occurred to twisted ankle just very very slightly limping as he went off the field but he certainly did not appear to be hurt badly I expect him to be out of player two and come right back on any carries 67 yards for Tony taking his place Elliott Walker where's the van ankles 34 hunter he's from tailback nice moves to the outside when this ball play was whistled then at the 43 as we go again the Steve some risky tony dorsett is off the field trainer Tim Karen Dafydd is working on his right calf it appears to be just a cramp they're having Tony take some salt pills and they're putting some analgesic rub on it to get some heat on the cramped muscle he's taking some salt pills the hawk is grounded right now but they're working on a very feverishly to get him back into the game as soon as they can ball pits phil has the ball back to you Chris all right Hutton 4434 Walker Walker is the fullback come closer to the quarterback second and four Walker tripped a little bit as he took the hand off Eliot Walker the junior from Miami Florida Tom de Paso and Ron Crosby on the tackle as they continue to rub that calf of Tony Dorsett valuable property the rain has been just heavy enough to make the field very very slick the Tartan turf unless it rains very very hard does not absorb enough water to give you very good footing and both teams have had misfortune of slippin considerable the time tonight and this half Pittsburgh for first down Penn State to here's a third floor for the Panthers getting the first down Elliott Walker and think best he's supposed to be a great blocker but he appears to be one fine runner as Tony Dorsett has shaken off that cramp and they're ready to come back into the game LF Walker who scored the only Pittsburgh touchdown in the six to seven loss against Penn State last year as Carson Long's point after was blocked so now with the ball at the 38 it's the first and ten for Pittsburgh courses still on the sidelines Jones and Taylor to the far side in a slot formation Hutton now driving him mainly to the outside the Pittsburgh Panthers have reached the 31 7 yard gain Crosby on the tackle Kent don't fret whether the Penn State defense is beginning to get just a little bit weary this Berg has been running a great deal wide of when you go wide the defense has got to pursue they've got to move 20 or 30 yards on every play when you're on a wet field your slippers you start it does slow you up today hey Orson is back in the lineup Eliot Parker is out 24 Jones is in the slot the split end his Taylor on a second and three I kind of hit him that benefit that and wind up a fullback in the I formation he's supposed to be at the tailback position very leisurely walking back a quiet man not solid the best way I guess to describe him he has sort of muted flamboyance don't need arson major the school of communication there's his coach Johnny major Penn State's coach Joe Paterno the ball of the 23 first in town here in the third quarter the score tied Cavanaugh Carson through a tremendous block on number 95 Tony Capasso and Dorsett brings the ball inside the 20 to the 15 and a half first down he's electrifying with total excitement he's got that ability to accelerate when he turns it on as we look at Lee Majors there he doesn't pop at any time because all the way Panthers on 1st and 10 at the 15 and a half his drag started at their own 40 the third turnover Pittsburgh Joe demonic of Mount Carmel Pennsylvania recovers a huntin fumble at the 13 of Ben's stake let's take a look at it again little trap play Walker broke it to the outside doesn't ever quite have good possession of the ball it bounces out of his hands he's supposed to hit that Chris about a yard further inside he didn't quite ever got to put away as it was ripped away there by a number 75 of Penn State and that was Randy Snyder from a 13 first bounce cephalo coming toward the backfield hurrying as guys and several panthers offenders look at him 21 coming up from his halfback position Wilson 58 was Cramer and 35 Dave decease y'all you just don't speak to see seven turnovers the first three quarters did a game that has this much meaning that I believe that it's these slipperiness of the turf where they just can't move with quite the precision that they'd like to on the start again the opportunity to work on the leg of Tony Dorsett defense has taken over after a fumble by Hutton second and eight now for Penn State 14 is tough you see no threw a touchdown pass in the first quarter to Bob Tory second and eight guys centauri are in the backfield 46 is Penske and motion guys and excitement about that one fist is the referee have blown the ball dead person Pittsburgh players posting that they have recovered the ball was there in a hurry for the fit defenses Tory humbled but the ball now is at the 13th take a look at it again he was on the ground before the ball bounced loose third down coming up Joe Paterno being the wise coats that he is are going into punt formation when you put on third down you never can have quite the same degree of rush or return because the defensive team cannot be sure that she will kick the ball let's see if Penske will be as effective as he was in the first half Willie Taylor is deep fair catch at midfield just inside his own territory a 37yard punt on third down for Penn State with a score tied at 7 2:38 left in the quarter Greene continues at Three Rivers Stadium Pittsburgh has controlled the ball eight minutes and 12 seconds here in the third quarter Penn State 4 minutes and 10 seconds score tied at 7 the ball near midfield Pittsburgh first down Cavanaugh slot formation Dorsett playing from the fullback spot takes people with him to the 43 of Penn State Kurt alderman on the tackle joined by Ron Crosby both coaches felt this would be a highscoring game kriss77 and the third quarter almost over indicates that you never are positive what's gonna happen before the game I think again that the rain and the turnovers have had the major effect now Dorsett is the deep back to the right of your screen on a second and three there he goes going right for that stake on the far side the forward stake did he get the first down bill banks on the tackle first down for the Panthers Dorsett now 92 yards on 24 carries and one touchdown those statistics are amazing because if you watched the whole game that doesn't appear the court that has really done a great deal and yet he's nearing the hundredyard mode from Oakland High School Aliquippa Pennsylvania the home also Henry Mancini on the near side we have Jones and Taylor Cavanaugh's quarterbacked all the way I never pulled back again this where they fell over lift him broke clean on the pat play and what season running freely enough secondary is good bye baby is just broken Flynn Davis's record of most career points scored 354 he is one away from time Homa Steve Owen who has 56 touchdowns and a brilliant career so Pittsburgh breaks the deadlock they have a 13 to 7 lead long now we'll try the point after here it is 50 yards and three plays thanks to a 40 yard scamper by Dorsett one of six children of Les at Myrtle Dorsett we were talking Chris sort of lulls you to sleep let's take a look at it again he's the fullback is this straight opening play excellent blocking by the center Palouse key also by the guard Carol that's Corbett coming across to pounce anybody who might get to him Tony knew when he broke past the linebackers there wasn't anybody gonna catch him Tony Dorsett set one NCAA record on that run tied another 356 points in his career breaking the record of Glen Davis 354 and he also tied Davis's record of 59 career touchdown run of forty yards by Dorsett gives him 132 for the game he's just tied to SCA records held by Archie Griffin most 100yard games of a season 11 and most 100yard games in her career 33 and he's ready to play some more I don't think 7 points is gonna hold up they've got to put some more on the board statistical avalanche for the Heisman Trophy Canada now Carson long who helped but his team I had well do the kicking they call him the Sundance Kid the punter Murray spider is puts Cassidy their are pals still raining as you see rich Marty for Penn State at the goal line coming up at the 510 to the 16 what a game 1:30 to go in the third quarter Pittsburgh is in the lead 14 to 7 unbeaten and untied tomorrow here on ABC Dravid resent another doubleheader 12:30 Eastern 11:30 central the Battle of the service academies Army Navy from Philadelphia bill Fleming is their league gross cup been

Oklahoma winning 20 to 17 in Lincoln today first and ten from the 15 Penn State's Bob Perry this time Chris when Penn State has yet to move the football if they do not make a first down here and are forced to punt Pittsburgh will have good field position and all that momentum going that the electrifying 40 yard run of course a second motion for them Scott Fitz clean the kicker comes in as a flanker replacing Jimmy cephalo of Pittston Pennsylvania he comes out here as a flanker now to the near side of the field at the bottom of your screen Tom Donovan 21 is the split end left and the slot is Jones and casino wants some yardage gold behind Donovan double coverage on Donovan had a very good rush also Chris by Holloway that time Cocina had just a little more time I don't believe that he would have missed the throat Steve Zabriskie rather comment okay Chris thank you as the rain continues to fall the footing becomes more more critical on your right you see what is called a rain shoe this is the shoe on the left that is usually worn on artificial turf and you can see there is a big big difference this one is the one most players are wearing right now back to you Chris all right third down and six missing off Penn State Donovan running a pattern Oh God big attack only his Pittsburgh team has had in years that Johnny majors have been their set offense state moving the ball lake caused them to come in now with about a fourth in Tim situation and they will have fine field position Pittsburgh will after the kick as I recall that is Randy Holloway's 15 sack of the year of the quarterback what a performance hits key ticking now that deep we have Willie Taylor inside the 50 here's the endoverend kick at the 49 about four yards a 40yard punt and the Panthers leading 14 to 7 get it at the Penn State 45 and they don't mind the rain they're very happy with it now Chris this Monday on ABC's NFL Monday Night Football the Minnesota Vikings will be in Candlestick Park to play the San Francisco 49ers last weekend the bikes clinched their 8th Central Division title in nine years the biking sportsmen were guided by quarterback Fran Tarkenton who holds nearly Hall with the NFL's career passing records the 49ers by the great gym collective a former Heisman Trophy winner all right from near the 45 first down for Pittsburgh Elliott Walker is in the backfield and Joe Paterno said this afternoon when I was talking to impressive wellthanks course it's so very tough is it your people start their fresh and as the game goes along and they just get a little bit weary Doris attempt to pick up speed and that's exactly what's happening here as the third quarter comes to a close Hesburgh 140 yards Penn State 24 yards in this quarter and that was the last play of the third quarter with number one ranked Pittsburgh leading Penn State 14 to 7 we'll be back for the fourth quarter after this at Mellon Bank we help you do more with your money with banking services and people who work harder for you that's Mellon banking Mellon banking helps you do more with your money channel for your Action News station two of American college football coaches whose jobs are assured very successful Joe Paterno of Penn State Johnny majors rumors being that he was going back to his alma mater of Tennessee no word on that but Johnny man who's challenging the supremacy of Penn State here in the east dinner cuskey saved a 6point run 24/7 incidentally on the previous run ending the third quarter Dorset gained 10 yards is now rushed for 6,000 yards in his career becoming the first back in NCAA history to reach well it seems an impossible number of yards in a career but I've seen a lot of great ones and always wind up wondering is he as good as OJ Simpson in college his record it's been every bit as good now he has 6,000 18 yards and more a few more from the Penn State 17 is colored by Ron Crosby and Tom to pass all number 95 slowly getting up I didn't he doesn't brush around getting back to the huddle conserves his energy but when the ball was he puts it all together and as I mentioned earlier the defensive team begins to lose a little bit of their quickness and Dorsett seems to gain quickness this is what a first Joe Paterno mentioned at halftime how much longer can we contain Dorsett Johnny majors his team with a second and five at the Penn State 12 out dorsum has broken a singleseason rushing record 1,800 in 14 minutes and 5 seconds left in the game humbling Eliot Walker goes in anytime Christus you get everybody looking at Dorsett his Penn State was doing that time you leave it open for the Tramp up the middle Walker bad ankles and all hit almost with as much speed as Dorsett have 14:05 of the final period parsing law and markers are everywhere don't saying if you're going to miss the count why you might as well miss it big and Peter Christie really did miss it big he went all the way through the backfield Pittsburgh with drives of 41 yards 50 yards in out 55 yards for their third touchdown have the distance to the goal line and you wonder should you go for to Chris but you only got to go a yard and a half that's what Pittsburgh's thinking about at the moment the last win over Penn State was in 1965 a lastsecond field goal by Frank Clark Pittsburgh winning at 32 27 one point after up and you call so 1405 less than a game and untied Pittsburgh leads 21 the 700d back we're looking at the coach of the year 1968 Joe Paterno great leader of young men who has Robert Browning's velocity of man's reach should exceed his grasp or what's a heaven before well right now he's trailing 7 to 21 he's playing against a very veteran Pittsburgh team most of these boys have played with each other for four years they took a little has a very young team that's going to come on very strong in the future and they're not of this out of this one yet there is Long's kick muddy looking at it at the one coming out now to the 10 Pittsburgh players grabbing the arm of Monty the ball squirted loose and let's see click over by the Nittany Lions so they will have a first and ten at about the 15 trailing 7 to 21 watch longest that ball way up in the air you can see how fast the coverage is downfield the ball is horn loose from him that people are going for it and state finally making the recovery Kubis a very important play for Penn State that they have not made the recovery there it almost wrecked this game up Penn State has not scored since the first quarter 21 yard pass play to see Nova's quarterbacking now to Bob Corey first and ten from the 15 lucena cephalo interception of the year Johnny major said that this defensive secondary of his was not we have a penalty flag down on the field Chris but there was against obviously Penn State so the penalty will be refused that we take a look at jury again making the interception will take over they have come up with 21 points now keeping Penn State scoreless since the first quarter Johnny majors went from the continuing drizzle that we've had since the start of the game and the Panthers have it just inside the Penn State 30 1337 left in the game this side of the veil Taylor and Jones Jones in the slot majors maybe a little bit wet but he's gonna radiate some happiness as we looked at him they're trying to get another one on the board let's go to Steve Zabriskie thank you Chris one of the big questions around this game is where will Johnny majors go will he go to Tennessee will they stay here at fit Bob Woodruff the Tennessee athletic director has contacted gasps my Solinsky to fit athletic director this week in regards to talking to matrix they have not yet talked to majors but they said they will when the regular season is over Southeast Conference letters of intent are due December 11th Tennessee wants to coach quickly and they want majors they're probably talked to him right after this game Chris Elliott Walker trying to get outside number 34 but Joe geminate number 30 and number 92 Rick Donaldson stopped him and the last two plays show you the character of his Penn State team staged absolutely set for them to fold two touchdowns behind they throw the interception the last two possessions Pettit scored two snaps they've stopped them dead let's see if they can do it the third time running a tradition of panthus name four years years Jones and telling the nearside third and seven Dorsett cut from behind by number 53 the senior Kurt Alderman the native of New Jersey a loss on the play of three yards so it's fourth down and ten Carson long we tried a 31yard field goal in the second quarter failing now Charlie running from the third at the hash mark of 37 plus the gem Indians own 47 yards a little righttoleft angle Larry slider what's castellated that 47 yards four to seven Arsen long you men think you know everything about your car key how many oil filters does it have cars among a 47yard Bill gahl Pittsburgh leading 24 7 and but quite a defensive stand by the Penn State defense forcing the field goal that was tradition pride the thing that has made the Nittany Lions the dominant team in the East for the past 10 years the stage was set for them to fold after interception they just geared up and didn't give them a thing freshman Mike cumin is the deepest of potential receivers over 24 long foot goes into the ball it's deep booming looking at it wisely funny we go to the sidelines and Steve's of rescue thank you Chris one of the big differences in this game in the second half as I'm sure you know is that Tony Dorsett has broken loose as a fit offense has really come on at halftime Pitt made some adjustments in the first half Penn State was stunning their linebackers shooting the gap and trying to get to the quarterback Cavanaugh before he could get the ball and disrupt the option play Kidd has made some adjustments in the offensive line and also in their backfield pitch scheme to eliminate that mistake and it has certainly worked for them okay Chris Johnny measures first and 10 now Sooey and guman are the backs guman on the carry the freshman from Nephilim Pennsylvania stop by Randy Holloway at the shoe top number 20 guman gets the first down for Penn State 1141 left in the game Pittsburgh lady 24 7 for cumin 22 yards 6 carries he's one of the freshman that Joe Paterno says are one of the best young players a discovered toad following in the footsteps of course at Lenny more Pacino cappelletti and Franco Harris who we've already seen tonight here in Pittsburgh gesina is a South part of the 14 and guman again as nice boobs waving his way to the 38 Arnie Wetherington of Miami Florida 59 and Dave the CCO in on the tackle there's a look at cumin yep three more very half the year is it'll make Joe Paterno very happy changing a footballs here on a boys night drizzle continues here at Three Rivers Stadium that ball is at the 39 second down and five gubernatorial setback Cory we scored the only Penn State touchdown on a pass from Fusina 21 yards James Cramer makes the tackle number 58 on Pittsburgh Penn State thought that they could throw the ball effectively against the Pittsburgh team Joe Paterno believed that that was gonna be the key to moving the football but thus far the interception could been a dominant plays for the Panthers defensively big play for Penn State third down and one and getting the first down Mike cumin of freshmen James Cramer backtoback tackles on guman as Penn State now has moved out to its own 47 turnovers five for Penn State Pittsburgh with three didn't every turnover cost you at least 40 yards so when he figured statistically that's 200 that they've given away you know it's game he's got as a sophomore you won't ever see a better thrown ball on this either she's seen the dropping straight back looks a little bit to the right sets that he had something on this one that Paul was singing through there let's be perfectly inspired made the catch 25 yards on the play the ball now 228 of Pittsburgh cumin cumin at the 25 gain of three second and seven coming up 938 left in the game Pittsburgh leading twenty four to seven and we were talking about the calibre of morale and tradition of the Penn State defensive team in the offenses picked up a little bit from it started just driving their own 20 the far side now in the slot pits key outside split in Donovan second and seven woman zoom into the 23 elder 37 on the tackle third down now five for the Nittany Lions Dorsett who has two touchdowns and several several records nationally and his own school Pittsburgh Penn State now 6 of 13 third down conversions here's another try Doug go for fourth down if they don't make it here beautiful beautiful play by positio just a co 35 busting true is from upper st. Clair Pennsylvania a sophomore he so that brings up a fourth down the ball is back of the 41 that's a loss of 18 walk down and 23 Scott Penske the punter is in screen pass called you're not supposed to get rushed that hard on his green fist because you're supposed to block him out and then let him come second but he came absolutely free 8:10 remaining in the game Pittsburgh leading 24 7 he got at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh confluence of the Alleghenies Monongahela forming the Ohio an area of 720 bridges were across the bridge from the Golden Triangle for this game pets keep punting on fourth down at 23 getting it up high Taylor is deep hoping that'll go into the end zone Penn State trying to knock it out number 30 Joe Dimmick a 41yard punt and now unbeaten untied Pittsburgh Panthers Joe Paterno the Penn State coach a lot of problems up to this point and the last picture we had a 20 Dorsett he was looking at the scoreboard to see how much time was left wondering how many more chances he'd have to carry the football coming up at the conclusion of today's game and will be the announcement of the Chevrolets scholarship winners for the outstanding offensive and defensive players of this game thousand dollar scholarship the general scholarship fund of the university I can guess your offensive choice up to now I think that most everybody else will agree with this Chris it won't be too much doubt about it right Tony Dorsett number 33 carrying on the play from his own 24 a couple of yards Bruce Clark another the Penn State freshman from New Castle Pennsylvania on the tackle so it'll be a second down and eight it's a dapper young fella it certainly is he may be go to movies like oj also like Jimmy Brown good effort little major in communications of the Steelers he's leaving us now to get ready for the next game 2nd tonight from the 22 Dorsett across the 25 to the 27 picking up five true co of Levittown on the tackle of course it's a very durable player Christine further the game goes the faster he seems to be and I believe that series although the other people slowing up just a little bit and he doesn't show up at all he maybe he just gets warmed up and loose faster 32 carries 173 yards and two touchdowns or the Aliquippa pennsylvania star dorset burden sorry now for the Panthers Joseph Walker blocking blocks and bursts of those 43 yards now 216 yards specimen look at in terms of speed on his Walker knocks the corner man out course it slows down what's up field decides that Eaton cut back and take it all the way he almost did but we had a fine defensive play by Donaldson the freshman linebacker who was in hot pursuit so now from the 31 of Penn State first down throw that beautiful block the second time he's done that tonight Dorsett not to carry the ball that time and picks up three yards to the 28 second down and seven there is gossip is one more touchdown this Pittsburgh team Chris is looking at that number one rating name they liked it they want to keep it then comes here very often first time since 1937 that they have been top ranked second and seven Garson bill banks on the tackle and again a nifty block drawn by Elliott Walker number 34 Dorsett getting up a little slow carrying to the 23 that's a gain of five so it'll be third down and two for Pittsburgh 525 left in the game twenty four to seven Pittsburgh in the lead don't you believe that getting up slow of course it means anything he's just trying to make the defense believe that he's as tired as they are and that is not true the final regularseason game or Dorsett course he'll go with the Panthers to the Sugar Bowl to meet Georgia here on ABC January 1 Dorsett again did he get the first down first down inside the 20 Crosby on the tackle I look back cross over the great runners I remember Mike Garrett of Southern California one of the scared me to death you've had Franco Harris of course many more of Penn State cappelletti of Penn State and OJ Simpson the incomparable Runner I don't believe that anyway at this stage in their career they never had any more abilities endorsed it and certainly directors proved that each year he's improved himself a little bit and he simply as a tremendous ball carrier three times on the Heisman voting 16 11 from last year fourth Kurt alderman makes the tackle on the quarterback on a keeper Matt Kavanagh who has done a great job or the Pittsburgh Panthers Matt Kavanagh remember he's a junior for Johnstown Ohio 6 to 209 pounds miss Junio a quick recap Tony Dorsett has become a first college back to gain 6,000 yards he's broken the singleseason rushing record of 1881 yards previously held by head Marinero Vulcan Clinton Davis's for Irkutsk on marks and now holds the career points work and here he is carrying again lots of traffic on a second down and eight from the Penn State 16 getting more records he's pokken button well he's dying Archie grippers for the most 100yard games and once you're over that hundred yard Mac you can't approve that so now with the ball at the 17 it's going to be a third down and nine the Panthers lost a yard on that play Cavanaugh who took over when Bob Hagan was injured in the Georgia Tech game now since Taylor 29 Jones 24 to the far side the top of your screen 39 and this time bill banks who has had a great defensive game forces Dorsett out of bounds and taxed a loss of approximately three yards fourth down now and 12 now to Steve it's a brisk eight Randy rue and number 19 for the Pitt Panthers who's their Kamikaze guy on special teams as we injured his left foot he probably has they think a hairline fracture of his left foot a couple of bones on the outside of his left foot it's an old injury but Randy is questionable now for the bowl game Sugar Bowl against Georgia Chris a 37 yard try by Carson long faking it slider throws into the end zone to Corbett well in a 4th down and 12 slider the holder a fake field all intended for Corbett to no avail the score is still twenty four to seven three oh nine left in the game you wouldn't expect it you're looking at Tony Dorsett Steve Zabriskie is definitely a side but a player hmm after a fake field goal attempt attempted pass penn state takes over at the 20 carrying on the play Matsui one of the three Suey brothers on the penn state roster and let's go to Steve Zabriskie this I'm down girls are pit bench but Tony Dorsett he just came out of the game Harry Jones the offensive backfield coach came over to the hawk and asked him if we get the ball back Tony do you want to go back in and get a shot at 2,000 yards this season Tony Dorsett said yeah you'd bet you if the Panthers get the ball back Dorsett may be ready to break yup another record Chris okay Thank You Penn State with the ball second down and six now from the 24 I started at there 20 in the lineup number thirtytwo along with Tori 39 Chuck Fusina intended for Tom Donovan and back covering was Wilson and jury I've got to mention once again about the pride tradition to this Penn State defense previous possession Pittsburgh marks from their own 22 the Penn State 20 once again the 50 Lions dug in and stopped them fake field goal peyote what an exciting football season but it continues here on ABC tomorrow armynavy JFK Stadium 12:30 Eastern 11:30 central and then followed by a heck of a game the Trojans of Southern California and vastly improved Notre Dame third and six Mussina hence Donovan ease in bounds Tom Donovan closing in at the 47 first down for the Nittany Lions to 11 remaining in the game Pittsburgh leading 20 4 to 7 he had a very fine man reaction here by piscina he rolls it out looks downfield very hard rush by Holloway you see that dead run pulls the ball back and finds the split receiver Donovan open Donovan makes the catch excellent throw Cocina 8 of 16 111 yards and one touchdown on the draw Matsui the freshman the colors of the suing family which but related to your earlier and he gets inside the Panther 35 Ella Chesley made the tackle as coach Johnny majors playing a lot of folks now there is a good look at suey we've got a few more years they have been to visit the Penn State has had this tenyear dominance of the East the first time that they have lost he the Panthers in ten years they've got a lot of young players and they'll be back Justina sack number sixteen this year for that great lineman from Sharon Pennsylvania a junior I've got to be very impressed with him across six six two hundred and forty pounds he's been dominant after Cena is hurt on the play coming to the near sideline the laws impacting the fortyseven of a second of twentythree and Duncan Hostetler number 15 a sophomore will replace Fusina he's another one of the brothers his

  "transcript": "you look like it looks like he's not going to gain much yardage cover but then he turns it on and all of a sudden he's got Tim you know I was amazed to hear how fast he really is he runs a four point three five he has been clocked that fast he's won a few guys who has ever run the 40yard dash that fast some pro scouts have clocked him at that and he just doesn't look that fast to me because he really glides in and wide receiver for pit number 19 randy brutish and more known for his special team kamikaze i spoke publicly Seaboard when a fan later in the game its first attempt from the west virginia 30 Cavanaugh the option Cavanaugh inside the 25 to about the 23 yard line Chuck Smith number 78 the 63 240 pounds senior tackle makes the tackle on Cavanaugh Cavanaugh came back pretty fast after a fractured fibula and Tommy you sick did a heck of a job of filling in for him you might want to amplify on that did you cover this team music was amazing story Cavanaugh's you see there was out for a few games with a broken ankle bald and music was like 16 quarterback back a few months ago he wasn't even on scholarship he came in earned the starting job and kept the Panthers undefeated it is second down and two Bobby Hutton the fullback gets the first down as he crosses the 20 to about the 17 or 18 yard line Joe gellick number 65 and norm Patterson number 91 make the tackle for West Virginia on hunter it was during that period when ducek was the quarterback had fit went back more to the eye formation and a game Tony Dorsett a chance to carry the ball more it was during that period that Tony really racked up most of his yards however Dorsett it has indicated that he's glad to have Cavanaugh back in there because it gives them more balance it is first intent for the Pitt Panthers from the West Virginia 17 Dorsett on the pitch to the right gets a block from Hutton thanks a very typical Tony Dorsett drive for a pitmaster touchdown and was 733 left to go in the first quarter the Panthers take the lead six to nothing on a 17 yard first by the hawk you see why this young man is the most illustrious ground gainer in NCAA history already has nine records in the NCAA book he is within reach of 18 he is rushed for over three miles he has that kind of speed we talked about this as a power sweep and I think we got to say that he gets the terrific blocking lock away outstanding blocking I think one of the great things about the Pitt Panthers is their downfield blocking they've been super added and Carson long has been super in that 37 in a row extra points for Carson long the Pitt Panthers lead seven to nothing we'll be back at the stadium in just a moment after after watching Oh Jay Simpson at USC in 1967 and 1968 I didn't think I'd ever see it since I think I found the band there he is you get an idea of his feet too he just turned on a burst and left people along the sidelines he uses a change of speed better than anybody I've ever seen there you see the score Pittsburgh seven to nothing over West Virginia Carson long set to kickoff to the West Virginia Mountaineers 40 lead owl 44 Dwayne woods and 32 Dave Riley in to receive for West Virginia 7:33 let's go in the first quarter first of all setting the ball up on the deer hash mark and as we mentioned a little bit arson mom set the record a week ago of the most kick scoring points in the history of NCAA football nobody knew about it till Tuesday Dorset's been breaking so many records nobody understood what was going on we want to welcome two people from the majority of the country who've been watching Notre Dame in Alabama to the Pitt West Virginia game here at Pitt Stadium in the Mountaineers were in fumbled on the goal line on the kickoff following a Pitt touchdown whisper key Mountaineers have recovered but they are backed up and the Pitt Panthers are fired up all over one half yard line Tony Dorsett has just run 17 yards for a kid touchdown and there you see the score seven to nothing Pittsburgh we have about seven and a half minutes to go in the first quarter this is team too risky along with Negro Scout once again a look at Tony Dorsett up the first touchdown of the day 17 yard run its the power pitch around right in all right let's go back to South Bend and Chris Schenkel West Virginia first down and 10 from their own 1/2 guard line kendra passing from the endzone complete the Lewis at the 11 yard line it looks to be enough garbage for the first down making the tackle number 37 Leroy Felder and number 31 safety man Bob jury for the Pitt Panthers boy this is a dangerous call back in your own inside and throw the down and enter the wide receiver he has a lot of confidence in Steve Lewis at the quick slant in know Kendra de Lewis the best passing combination for them out there it got them off the goal line quickly first intent on their own 11 here's a flare pass up the woods he's hit behind the line of scrimmage Leroy Felder number 37 coming up from his defensive back position a junior at 510 and 190 making an outstanding defensive play the loss is about two yards back to the 9 yard line it'll be second down and 12 now for the Mountaineers quick screen from back in there that's another risky call Leroy Felder is one of three good ones in that defensive secondary what do they have a total of 19 interception 19 going into this game and Bob curry as a matter of fact is tied for third in the nation Kendra rolling out to the right on third down out of bounds Cedric Thomas made the completion but he was out of bounds 21 JC Wilson there defending for Pitt I believe I said third down that was second down it is now third down and 12 for the Mountaineers from their own nine yard line third and 12 and in this obvious passing situation should they choose to continue to go upstairs the most likely target would be split in Steve Lewis who is far and away the leading receiver on the team just four shy of the 40 which would make him second for the season reception third down and 12 Easley on the draw play Walker easily out near the 20 yard line Arne Wetherington number 59 makes the tackle for fifth he'll be sure at a first down yardage by about two and a half to three yards and so West Virginia will have to kick it away from deep in their own territory the Pitt cheerleaders on the sidelines and they have had a lot to cheer about this year Betty back to punt Willie Taylor 29 deep to receive for the Panthers standing at his own 40yard line then he will kick it away from about his own 10 rushes on Taylor let's advance it takes the Pitt bounce inside the 50 yard line at about the 48 yard line of West Virginia and it's down there by the Mountaineers this Monday on ABC's NFL Monday Night Football the juice will be in action and the Buffalo Bills will go up against Dallas Cowboys from Texas Stadium in Irving Texas it has not been a good year for the bills but the truth is always the show and you won't want to miss that one the Dallas Cowboys are 8 and 1 this year they have as good a record as anybody in the league with Staubach enjoying a super season it's an important game for the Cowboys they have only a one game lead over the st. Louis Cardinals Monday night at 9:00 NFL Monday Night Football Dorsett on 1st and 10 seventyeight Chuck Smith makes the tackle a gain of about three yards on the play the ball just shy of the Mountaineer 45 yard line it'll be second down and seven well after an opening series in which Matt Cavanaugh elected to go upstairs he's gone back to the basics it's been a TV show from there on again split backs in the backfield second down and seven Cavanaugh in the option Dorsett in trouble reverses his field white shirts are looking for Tony you lose a couple of yards 9010 Braswell and number 13 johnny Shella from the secondary make the tackle john major's told us yesterday that his coaching has made Tony Dorsett a heck of a runner just the same way Jack Curtis made me a heck of a passer at the University of Utah I don't know if you could coach this sort of thing or not I think there's certain natural instincts involved right here Tony says on the field sometimes you feel a little bit supernatural sort of dream like it looks like a dream out there sometimes doesn't 36 yards so far for dosha it is third down and 10 following the loss of three Cavanaugh still looking for a receiver hangs it up out of Bounce playing it safe on third and 10 and the Panthers will kick it away from the West Virginia 48 yard line and so after the Panthers took it in good field position their previous possession West Virginia rises to the occasion and cover they have some white shirts following mr. Dorsett around this afternoon Barry White or back deep to punt I thought hanging up there fair catch called for by pride for Tom fried more takes it at the 14 yard line and the Mountaineers again will be deep in their own hole as they go on offense once again we'll be back with Pittsburgh leading West Virginia 7 to nothing the stadium this afternoon this is the first sellout of the year for the Panthers 56,000 500 and a lot of them are from West Virginia with Morgantown being only 60 miles away this game whether it's played there or here always plays to an overflow crowd the Mountaineers go on offense first and 10 from just short of their own 15yard line straight up the middle the tackle made by 68 Don parish easily the ball carrier once again easily is a pretty big kit for a freshman he's 6 2 and 210 you ran that play just a couple times yeah I run it a few too many times that's why I'm not playing anymore there you see what the West Virginia offense has done 327 yards per game and they're passing nearly as much as they're running pretty good balance they would like to have that kind of balance today second down in six after the gain of four the pass to woods Woods got a first down he's at the 30 yard line the tackle made by Jeff Delaney number 14 and cover it looks as a penalty marker down on the field however in the plate may be nullified but it looks as if that's West Virginia's game plan to open up that Panther defense a little bit you know they've got the the guy in Dan Kendra he can really throw the football he can do a lot of things he can throw running to his right or his left as you see right here and he scatters five quite a bit he'll bring guys out of the backfield to utilize the three primary receivers and this may go in favor of the Mountaineers it looks as if it is against the Pitt Panthers they're talking the number 75 Steve early the offensive captain from the West Virginia Mountaineers it was a second down and six play who's got an F yardage for the first down and the Panthers have backed up away so we'll wait to see what West Virginia has decided to do there were two flags dropped on the play it is defensive holding against the Pitt Panthers and it gives West Virginia a first down at their own 33 yard line this is the best field position they've had today Lee Kendra is a streaky passer boy he can get real hot and hurt you just like example was the last drive last year in the ball game that it thrilling 1714 win I think he completed six straight first and ten Mountaineers operating from their own 33 said the Thomason motion camera rolling out pressure Todd Kendra trying to find some Running Room there's some blue shirts around him and they run him out of bounds 37 Leroy Felder the first Panther to get to him he picked up a little bit of yardage however out past the 35 yard line there you see the situation we're in the first quarter with 328 to play in fit leading 7 to nothing good speed in that Pittsburgh secondary Leroy Felder is a 4:6 man there's Frank Cignetti who is we mentioned earlier was an assistant right here at Pittsburgh the year that John Major's had his first head coaching job at Iowa State both Cignetti and majors are very very enthusiastic young coaches this is Dwayne woods on the sweep to the left woods gets very short yardage dragged out of bounds by number 58 Jim Cramer and number 80 kid will a mouse key the defensive end on that side the gain is out to the 39 yard line it'll be third down and five yards to go for the Mountaineers from their own 39 hello there hello ladies they're keeping warm who is your Pitt Panther you notice they all have these buttons that say my Pitt Panther is it's third down and five Kendra on the roll out first the Lord's almost intercepted by JC Wilson number 21 it was intended for number 33 Steve Lewis and so it'll be fourth than five and again West Virginia will have to kick it away there you see JC Wilson the cornerback he's another one of those guys I just talking about with a good speed for six in the 40 Leroy Felder's about four six Bob jury I thinks about a four seven and all of them seem to have very good instincts for the football Jeff Betty back to punt the West Virginian again 29:20 Taylor the receiver for channel 9 drive low kick taken by the up back and fumbles it's still live in West Virginia here's the ball at the 21 yard line of hip now bear fans are excited as the West Virginia players get their first break to the afternoon they're so happy about it there may injure one another find dry spot was taken by number 21 Jason goes to the unpacked JC Wilson having a trouble get his handle off the football or there's a big pileup who finally gets it did you see it looked to be weapon on West Virginia who covered the football Randi WEP ler the Mountaineers get a break and that's what they'd be first and ten Manuel Rodriguez Rodriguez stopped by Bob curry in the secondary it's inside the 20yard line at about the 17 of Pitt Manuel Rodriguez the backup to Cedric Thomas coming in aw don't you love it when they start pulling out those gadget plays Johnny majors calls those cow pasture play that's right here's one of those cow pasture plays it's the end around the fake is the option fake us to the right the pitch goes to the wide receiver Manuel Rodriguez on second down and five it looked as if the ball might have popped loose but West Virginia recovers the tackle made by Jim Cramer and Cecil Johnson Walter easily as you can see with 318 yards on the year picks up the first down at the 11 yard line of the Pitt Panthers and the West Virginia fans have really tough life the Pitt fans are yelling for defense first and ten from the fifty level West Virginia getting a break on the fumble pipe again it's easily up the middle crosses the 10th without the 9 yard line maybe to the 8 Arne Wetherington number 59 makes the tackle Paul lovely number 35 is normally 2 starting fullback water easily the freshman doing a good job of filling in lovely the leading ball here at the team with over 400 yards easily got 2 on that play second down and eight just inside the 19 yard line of the easily I can't down to the 6 yard line Kramer and Witherington make the tackle the two linebackers for Pitt third down and what looks like a passing situation now one of the plays they have liked down here is to fake the veer option and go to their crossing pattern in which they they get to criss cross between Steve Lewis on the tight end a critical situation now it is third down and about six yards to go West Virginia can get a first down without scoring a touchdown in the middle incomplete intended in the end song or number 83 Ben McDade the tight end Jeff Delaney number 14 was defending and may have got the hand on the ball for Pitt fourth and six now from the seven yard line and apparently we're going to have a field goal attempt tonight ABC Sports will present a special twohour primetime special the Battle of the Network Stars tonight nearly $400,000 on the line as teams from all three networks consisting of five men and three women tonight at 9:00 on ABC bill Mackenzie's

Pittsburgh we have just 50 seconds remaining in the first quarter of play mid Panthers will go back on offense now in West Virginia in talking to coach banks Cignetti cover earlier in the week he said the tax what they were going to have to have they're gonna have to get some turnovers from Pitt gets the breaks in the game and they're going to keep it close to stay with them and have any chance for what they certainly want to be an upset he also stressed the importance of this first quarter of taking it to Pittsburgh in the first quarter want to tell you once again about what's coming up tonight at 9:00 a special sports presentation battle of the Network Stars some of the contestants for ABC will include Ron Howard of happy days and gave Kaplan of welcome back kotter CBS will feel among other stars Telly Savalas Sonny Bono and Jimmy JJ Walker the memorable show you won't want to miss it the Battle of the Network Stars something for fun tonight at 9:00 Eastern five for most of these ABC stations akin see kicks off taken by the up back Tom sindelle Walter 446 across the 30yard line Cinda Wald is injured her probably would have been playing today and placed a Bobby Hutton at fullback the Panthers with pretty good field position they go on offense first and ten at their own 31 on the short kick by McKenzie aboutthere's on defense they've had some problems with injuries and they're a little thin they're a scrappy bunch and they're here to get Pitt everything they can Cavanaugh on the option for us is the 35 Cavanaugh across the 40 the 45 and run out of bounds just short of the 50 yard line by Paul George number 47 the free safety that Kavanagh has really come into his own in the last two season he shared the duty last year but Bobby hatred and Hagar got injured early this season and Cavanaugh has really come on Bobby was with us yesterday in the film festival Dee was there on crutches still Kavanagh gives him a first down at the Rome 48 yard line the Panthers leading 7 to 3 near the end of the first quarter Dorsett Goha crosses the 50 run out of bounds at about the 47 yard line of West Virginia 22 Tom pie for the strong safety makes the play why do they call him hot as I understand it his father gave him his nickname originally there you see dorset's 39 yards so far today he can see so well even as a youngster that his father called him Hawkeye and he sees so much on a football field when he's carrying the football they just call him the hawk he also flies like a hawk when he gets food he has tremendous peripheral vision and great eyesight Bobby Hutton near the 45 yard line of West Virginia 51 Frank Gleason the defensive end a junior at 6 3 and 2/10 along with Norm Patterson number 91 make the tackle Bobby Hutton a very very steady performer he plays pull back and tailback for the Panthers filling in of course for Elliott Walker who is the second most prolific ground gainer in Pitts history right behind Tony Dorsett and he not played in the shadow of Dorsett you might be a superstar it is third down and two the Panthers operating from the West Virginia 45 yard line that's the end of the first quarter as time runs out with the Pitt Panthers leading 73 over the West Virginia Mountaineers will return to pit stadium in just a moment I'm ready to start the second quarter steam super skill on with beat libro stuff from this Stadium and a backyard braless underway with the fist answers leading 7 to 3 they have a first attempt at the West Virginia 45 yard line and they have enjoyed excellent field position so far it is third down and three yards to go forfeit the fake to Hunton Cavanaugh the option cuts inside buses the 40 the 30 Cavanaugh down near the 25yard line the tackle made by number 13 Johnny shell in the West Virginia secondary was known early in his career as a passer and not so much of a runner cover he's really come on as a rusher I really like the way he runs the football and watching him in the highlights develop yesterday and some of the things I noticed that his running a but he's a very smart runner he uses his blockers very well he knows how to make the right cut he doesn't have the blinding speed doesn't have the speed to say a Bobby Haygood has but he's a very smart runner bursts in 10 Panthers Dorsett dives over the middle gets down near the 20yard line number 65 Joe gellick the middle guard and number 78 Chuck Smith the defensive tackle makes the play on Dorsett so far West Virginia has done a pretty good job of bottling up Tony but they really haven't given him the ball a great deal so far been used sparingly it's one of the things that the Dorsett said he likes is the return of Cavanaugh gives the offense a lot more balance he may not have to carry as much but it might give him the chance to come a long one somewhere along the line gain of four on the play it is second down and six now from the 21 yard line counter option cattleman keeping Cavanaugh at the 15 down to the 14 yard line the play made by 47 Paul Jordan the senior free safety for West Virginia he jammed his hand when he went down chopper I don't know whether he hurt his wrist or what if that might affect his passing you can see him shaking it a little bit there and looking over to the bench Tommy usek start warming up your arm Cavanaugh from Youngstown Ohio Cavanaugh now for Russia's 52 yards and he's gone upstairs successfully also it's another first down for the Panthers first and 10 from the 14 yard line Dorsett inside the 10 to about the 9 yard line the hawk just keeps nipping away at you truck Smith makes the tackle music is an interesting story cover you mentioned him in case Cavanaugh was to come out of the ballgame there he is number 13 he was a sixth team quarterback wasn't even on scholarship a walkon player they went to him early in this season when both a good and Cavanaugh were injured they went away from the passing game a little bit and relied on Dorsett a lot and he brought him through with three wins did a super job of course his uncle's the old Michigan State poor thing second down at five Bobby Hutton straight up the middle here's a five yard line the Panthers keep chipping away at a tough and scrappy West Virginia defense norm Patterson number 91 makes the tackle very close to first down yardage it'll be third down in about a yard to go at the five yard line for Pittman third and short yardage they've kind of liked that lead option down in here quite a bit of the time of course when they line up in the eye you kind of get a sense that maybe they're gonna get the ball to their tailback and they do the power play with Dorsett straight up the middle closer to go lion stops in about the 2 yard line Paul Jordan 47 up from the secondary to meet Dorsett along with Tom Frei for the monster man it's a first and goal now for the Panthers at the one of the many interesting things about Tony Dorsett is that he has grown a lot physically since they first came here as a freshman I think he checked in about 155 pounds let's watch him you see he has the physical strength now he's weighing in about 185 to 190 pounds and he's really beefed up since his freshman year he can still fly he says the heavier and stronger he gets the faster he gets its first and goal from the 2 yard line of West Virginia for the Pitt Panthers they lead 7 to 3 here in the second quarter Dorsett was the goal line touchdown Pitt Dorsett with that extra second effort and you see the Pitt student section there they love it the Panthers go out in front 13 to 3 another touchdown for Tony Dorsett touchdown number 18 for mr. TV 11 carries 53 yards already nor Siddhas Amanda makes the goal 53 yards and 11 carries this cover said two TDs today Carson long out of Larry sweaters hold his 38 consecutive extra point and the Pitt Panthers go out in front with 12 32 left to play in the first half 14 to 3 we're going to be joined now by the people who've been watching the Notre Dame Alabama game we asked you in the midatlantic states to stay with us hello everyone I'm steams too risky and we welcome you viewers who've been joining the Alabama dota Dame game in South Bend with Mia's League Rose cup and we're here in Pitt Stadium in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania where the Pitt Panthers have now is taking a 14 to 3 lead over West Virginia on this touchdown by 20 Dorsett from his tailback position one of his favorite plays the isolation Tony Dorsett gets touchdown number two now got 11 carries 53 yards just another typical day for Tony Dorsett let's go back now to Chris Chico and but Wilkinson in South Bend Indiana Marshall log again getting ready to kick off and amid Panthers have been pretty much in control of this game one of the key things I think so far covers been field position fit has enjoyed except for the double punt exceptional field position West Virginia has not Carson said to kickoff back deep to receive again Lee Dowell number 40 Blaine was 44 along with number 32 Dave Riley for West Virginia dowel out to the 20yard line maybe does get across the 20yard line I think that's an important point you just made one of the real subtle things about this Pittsburgh team is their kicking game in the way it has influence field position for the last few years with Carson long and in Larry spider they call them Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid spider is butch and Carson is Sundance in the spider holes for Carson long they are kicking buddies and they have really done the job first in 10 West Virginia from their own 20 the pitch easily around the right side up near the 25yard line JC Wilson and Edwin Emmaus key make the tackle for Pitt one of the reasons that easily did not gain more on that might have been a missed assignment cover sometimes these wide receivers are a little reluctant to really stick their noses in there to get a good piece of the man's chest I don't know what to tell you maybe saving himself for the Bob later I think ed will a mouse key had him out wait a little bit second down at five Kendra dropped for a loss the ball is loose inside the 20yard line I believe West Virginia has recovered however al Romano number 91 there Outland Trophy candidate an allamerican those guard came in to make the hit on Kendra hit him from the blind side and the ball popped out West Virginia maintains possession however and we may have a penalty I think we do a defensive holding penalty the second one of the afternoon against the Pitt Panthers holding on the defense is a call a cup or you don't see very often we've seen it twice already here in the first half there you summit JC Wilson and Steve woods I'm at it I think that's selfexplanatory I don't think I have to even comment on that picture well I think the penalty might have been justified it gives the West Virginia Mountaineers a first down at their own 32 yard line and that's a break because it would have been third and very long yardage back inside their own 20 first and ten for the Mountaineers at their own 32 Kendra trying to get some offense consistency going here Cedric Thomason motion on the sprint out can't find anybody open at the 35 and runs out of bounds wisely at about the 38 yard line Cecil Johnson the senior defensive end for Pitt with chasing him out discretion is the better part of what Sports quiz better part of intelligence really I think he'll last a long time if he keeps doing that sort of thing along with the old Fran Tarkenton slide you know see those linebackers coming you just little slide duck under the clothesline he did a good job he picked up about six yards it is second down and four from the 38 pitch the woods butch crosses the 40 yard line good power running is he broke a sack oh he was hit by Edwin Emmaus key number 80 and then drove forward for some extra yardage and got up around the 43 yard line of West Virginia it's enough for a Mountaineer first down Duane woods number 44 Duane was just to amplify on him he was the second leading ball carrier on the team last year with over 400 yards they looked for him to be the leading ball carrier this year he really hasn't had the kind of year that they expected last Wednesday I was down at West Virginia I saw him in the weight room and he although he's pretty small as an extremely muscular and strong fellow first in ten West Virginia from their own 44 Kendra on the quarterback draw he's trapped behind the line of scrimmage and dropped for a loss in there very quickly randy holloway number 70 the defensive tackle who relies very very heavily on his quickness now Romano number 91 has gone out of the game with an injury al Romano gets more of the ink but what's this big Randy Holloway up day we talked to him yesterday he's got 61 tackles he's one of the more underrated lineman really along with Cecil Johnson it's a loss of five on the play at second down and 15 from the West Virginia 39 yard line Rodriguez in motion to crawl play easily maybe got back to the line of scrimmage Jim Cramer the linebacker number 58 played it very well and made the first contact here's what the 50 fences time covers that is something as a comment on West Virginia wanted to do is to come out to be able to establish a running game but they are just running into a big physical defensive wall by v Lawson perhaps a happy yard on the play it's still third down and 15 and Kendra wants to put it up pressure from Romero and he's got from behind back around the 30yard line al Romano with his second sack of the game on West Virginia quarterback Dan Kendra al Romano the senior Outland Trophy candidate winner 63 230 pounds what's really remarkable about that is the fact that he runs the 40yard dash in 4.8 puddi back to punt for West Virginia Jay or brother Willie Taylor the deep receiver back around his own 35 yard line for fifth high kick hanging up nicely Willie Taylor at the 31 with a fair catch the Pitt Panthers will go back on offense at their own 31 yard line 9 minutes and 8 seconds left to play in the first half we'll be back in just a minute it's right up to date Shepard 5700 22 yards as of right this minute along with 52 touchdowns Tony says he'd like to push it up to about 6,000 yards so that nobody would ever break the record in his lifetime well West Virginia is doing everything they can to prevent him from doing that and they've done a pretty good job of bottling him up here's Matt Cavanaugh remember earlier when he went down out of bounds we told you he looked like he was shaking his right wrist we have a report now that he has a contusion or a bruise on his right elbow it is not considered to be serious enough to keep him out of the game however he will continue to play and you might be able to see their cover it looks fooling you can actually see the swelling I'd say during between plays you better get some ice on that that is obviously swollen we'll have to wait see how if at all it affects his passing and they do rely on Cavanaugh's arm from time to time we have 9 minutes 8 seconds left to go in the first half Tony Dorsett has scored two touchdowns bill McKenzie has picked a field goal for West Virginia and the Pitt Panthers lead 14 to 3 so far I think some of the defense has been more dominating than their offense even though they've scored 14 points that's something we talked about earlier and I think we ought to continue to talk about it throughout the game is because of Dorsett publicity that the defense has really been kind of overlooked at time coming up remember following this game as a part of our doubleheader the national telecast of a very important Southwest Conference game from Little Rock Arkansas the Arkansas Razorbacks and the Texas A&amp;M Aggies that's it for following this game here on ABC 1st down and 10 Panthers operating from their own 30 Dorsett to the outside tries to cut inside gets back across the 35 47 Paul Jordan and 86 buzzy thornton the defensive end to the Mountaineers make the play on Dorsett as he picks up about 7 yards out to the 38 yard line here's a better look at one of Tony Dorsett favorite plays its the power pitch with him and the tailback position out of the I formation you get a sense once again of that incredible cutting ability the way you can plant that right foot and just change directions while gliding along at nearly top speed second down and three Cavanaugh on the option good defense by West Virginia they took away the pitch man Hutton and they made this cap off with Culbertson number 50 and 51 Brandt Leeson the defensive end on the right side making the play why speaking of that ALM Arkansas game what a matchup for those two running backs we got Ben Cowan who's the leading rusher in the Southwest Conference going up against big old George Woodard of the Texas Aggies everybo lore has been waiting a few days for that rematch you know Cavanaugh may have lost just a little bit it is still third down and three however fit operating from their own 37 yard line out of the I formation Cavanaugh fakes to Dorsett Cavanaugh wants to throw now he's gonna rhyme 4550 in West Virginia terrorists at the 35yard line Matt Cavanaugh scrambling for big yardage Johnny shell number 13 finally brings him down into West Virginia secondary that's one of the nice advantages of having a Russian tectonic quarterback when you've got a deep zone defense because once he gets past these been up front look at there is a fine move right there he's got a lot of space now and look at the downfield blocking once again if Dorsett could have gotten over there to get Johnny shell Kavanagh might have gone all the way Johnny shell saves the day for West Virginia and it gives the Pitt Panthers of 1st and 10 at the West Virginia 33 yard line Cavanaugh has really cooked some buddies down a West Virginian players down it looks like the far sideline just out of bounds at about the 35 yard line we can't see who it is however I think it might have been the man who got blocked by the wide receiver I think Gordon Jones really got a lick on somebody down there the NJCAA begun in 1937 with 13 junior colleges in one sport greets the bicentennial year of 1976 now with 585 member colleges and 19 sports 19 men's national championships and 11 women's national championship the ng saved AAA while the West Virginia players being attended to will remind you with seven and a half minutes to go here in the first half this Backyard Brawl has hit out at front forty two three on to Tony Dorsett touchdown West Virginia's score came on a bill Mackenzie field goal following hits fumble of a punt Paul Jordan a defensive back number 47 is the injured player he was downfield trying to make the tackle on that Cavanaugh when he got a real surprised shot I think from I believe it was Jones who nailed it from his wide receiver spot Jordan is an important player their free safety is senior at six feet in 185 pounds and we certainly hope he's alright on first and ten for the Panthers from the Mountaineer 33 yard line Cavanaugh out of the I formation to pitch back to Dorsett Dorsett trying to get around the outside and there's a lot of whiteshirted Mountaineers there Tony will lose about a yard 22 Tom pie for the strong safety is the first player to get to him we want to remind you the coming up at halftime today we'll have a fireman's fund flashback it will feature a look at last week's two big upsets in NCAA football produce win over Michigan and the Georgia Tech Notre Dame upset that's the fireman's fund flashback today at halftime here on college football on ABC loss of one second down and 11 now from the 34 yard line of West Virginia option pass Cavanaugh looking over the middle overthrown intended in the end zone for Jordan Jones number 24 or Willie Taylor 29 as they were converging Tom Pridemore number 22 and 43 Greg Anderson we're back defending that's cold everybody go deep I'll find you that's one of those old cow pasture plays this is a series that Pitt put in as a matter of fact during the Duke game to take a little pressure off of their option game they start out looking like the option and then Cavanaugh drops back and throws the pass Cavanaugh that day through five touchdown passes to tie a record and most of it was because of plays like that this time it didn't work however it is third and 11 from the 34 yard line of West Virginia Cavanaugh on the straight drop back pressure and he's drop troubles of football West Virginia may have recovered we'll see Chuck Smith number 78 one of the top defensive players for West Virginia with the pressure on Cavanaugh Pitt has it nonetheless it'll be fourth down in a mile and a half to go is it's back at about the 45 yard line of West Virginia near the 44 and lares wider is on to punt Chuck Smith's known as Snuffy stumpy Smith right out of the bounds of West Virginia Tom Pridemore back deep to receive lets it go bounces into the end zone as it landed on the five or six yard line and so West Virginia will be back to take on offense at the 20 yard line we'll be back in just a minute do you think this game is good wait till you see what's coming up next on ABC the Arkansas it takes is a in it thank you Hawk the hawk wants to be a TV announcer by the way what's this Tony George I said don't leave the door set he's a French mole that should be a great game no four o'clock following regional telecasts such as this one a national game between Texas A&amp;M and Arkansas a most important Southwest Conference game here we have six oh eight to go in the first half West Virginia first and 10 from their own 20 easily the ball carrier fighting for yardage 70 Randy Holloway making the tackle for Pitt Paul lovely now in the game in place of Easley we did not expect to see lovely he was on crutches as late as Wednesday this week he game two however it'll be second down and eight Lumley's their leading ball carrier company it's kind of a surprise we knew that he was dressed out but we weren't sure that he could play the day at the good they'd be alright that could help a lot second down and eight from the 22 yard line Rodriguez in motion to the top of your screen Kendra watch the throw lieutenant for Lewis it's overthrown Lewis took a shot from Bob jury for 31 the pass ball is incomplete however it'll be third down and eight from the 22 this program is being brought to you as a special exclusive of ABC Sports now let's pause five seconds to allow our local stations to identify themselves this is wtaetv channel for Pittsburgh West Virginia out on offense with third down and eight operating from their own 22 yard line Kendra fakes dropping straight back has plenty of time the pass intended over here in the near side for number 83 the tight end phonemic Day Bob curry number 31 defending on the play forfeit and so the West Virginia Mountaineers will again have to punt it away that's one of the plays that's been very effective for the Mountaineers this year and you and I were looking at films yesterday the the pittsburgh coaching staff commented on that it was something that they were concerned about they've had very good luck with crossing pattern up out of play pass action jeff Fetty will kick it away from about his own 10yard line Willie Taylor back he ready with a nice move finally gets it away and they're gonna let it bounce down around the 40 yard line the 35 yard line of Pitt and it's gonna be down inside the 35 at about the 33 yard line 5:15 left to play in the first half Pitt leading West Virginia 14 to 3 Dorsett just had to put on a new jersey pepper he's he goes through more jerseys probably than any other player in college football he tears away and he has a few jerseys turned away to Tony Dorsett our new pro ball reader Tony serious he wants to be a television sportscaster but I think he may spend a few years in pro football before he gets to that career in his first intent for the Pitt Panthers they are on offense operating from their own 34 yard line Cavanaugh to throw Kevin on a Corbett the tight end run out of bounds at about the 43 yard line by number one left cornerback Carol woods of West Virginia Jim Corbett the leading receiver for the fifth Panthers gives them not quite enough garbage for the first down as they mark it at the 43 yard line it'll be second down about one speaking of crossing patterns we said that West Virginia's had good luck with him Jim Corbett has been very successful coming underneath on the crossing pattern came into today's game with 26 catches he's added two more so far Corbett from Erie Pennsylvania second down and one for the Panthers from their own 43 Dorsett first down out near the 50 yard line stopped at about the 49 yard line Harold woods number one up from the secondary along with right side linebacker number 55 Jeff Massarelli a 6foot 210 pound sophomore another one of the favorite plays out of the I formation for the tailback is a sprint draw let's watch Tony Dorsett as he kind of takes a little jab step to his right the Cavanaugh start sprinting to his right then he just slips the ball to Dorsett the sprint draw the isolation play and the power sweep are the three favorites first and 10 Panthers from their own 49 and Cavanaugh goes nowhere cut defensive reaction by West Virginia Frank Gleason the defensive end with a fine play he's being congratulated by his teammates number 51 along with Joe gellick number 65 who split over to help out a loss of well I right at the line of scrimmage maybe he lost a few inches it's second down and 10 still at the 49 yard line of the Pitt Panthers four minutes and 17 seconds left to go in the first quarter Pitt leading 14 to 3 Jordan Jones but to the right Willie Taylor to the left Calvin I'll drop straight back Gavin I drop some football it's a loose West Virginia has recovered the Mountaineers get another break 78 Chuck Smith in there to recover that football as a ball just dropped out of Cavanaugh and as he was trying to avoid the rush and the Mountaineers are happy that's one of the things you talked about earlier is that West Virginia was hoping to get some turnovers it was a turnover that set up their first three pointer now they find themselves as the clock starts ticking down to those final minutes of the first half with once again excellent field position first and ten from the pittsburgh 43 Dan Kendra makes the broad alumni looking to pass pressure gone he gets away from Rome at all incomplete antenna for money intercepted by JC Wilson number 21 the ball hit lovely in the hand see Wilson came up to ping it off in the bottom plane or backtoback turnovers and the Panthers will go back on offense these are the kind of plays you'll look back on as the game boat moves on and you think well this was really perhaps in the turning point of the game West Virginia with excellent field position here they have a man wide open it's lovely the leading ball carrier and for obvious reasons not the leading receiver who is I think was the late Paul Crispin just as they hit him in a bad place right in the hand and so Pitt gets a break and takes away a possible West Virginia scoring opportunity first and tenth Panthers from their own 31 Jones container are both bent to the right side screen to the flanker to Jones Jones trying to find some Running Room just four or five urs he can't get away from Tom fly for however the strong safety number 22 one of West Virginia's top defensive people makes a great play to keep that from being a big game out near the 35 yard line gain of about four on the play it'll be second down and six Gordon Jones I talked about him earlier I'm going to amplify a little bit more he's just an incredible a physical specimen an allaround athlete who has a vertical jump of 38 inches he has a standing broad jump of over 11 feet he's a gamebreaking type tremendous in the open field nine formation Pitts back to Dorsett running as he crosses the 40yard line a fine defensive effort by 6500 gellick the middle card or Dorset might have gone at least another 10 or 15 yards Jill Jill ik the middle guard has been the busiest guy along the front wall 89 tackles here he is boy hey that's a good effort and it's not very often that you see TV go down just by one hand nobody was more surprised than Tony Dorsett as he was starting to motor he had really turned it on when he got to the corner of jelly cat and got him it's a lot of daylight he didn't get enough for the first down however as you see as he crossed the 40yard line the ball is at the Pittsburgh 41 and the Panthers will have a first intent from that point three minutes now remaining in the first half Pitt still leading West Virginia 14 to 3 and the Mountaineers have played a lot of defensive but they've been scrappy again Jones and Taylor are both foot to the right side pitch back to Dorset out of the I formation running to the right same way to this side horse it is a 50 45 yard line in West Virginia territory by number 50 10 Culberson the left side linebacker it's enough for another pitch first down however this Dorsett takes it in to Mountaineer territory and the hawk keeps flying the law that gives him over 1,600 yards as we look at him again on one of his favorite plays he not this is his 16th carry gives him 85 yards for today and once again you get a sense of the way he could change direction the stopping and starting ability he's just one of the most exceptional runners I've ever seen if not the best and one key to that was the Gordon Jones the wide receiver was blocking his man 15 yards down field the Panthers as we said have some of the greatest downfield blocking they want to get that yardage for the hawk I think the Panthers may have taken too much time as whistles flow may have yes it is a delay of your call against some good Panthers and that'll cost them five yards so to make it first down and 15 2 minutes and 13 seconds now left in the first half 14 to 3 fit over West Virginia and the copper will leave us now as Leake gross Cup makes his way down to the field for some halftime interviews be talking to both coaches and we'll have a special ceremony for you at halftime coming up involving the hawk Tony Dorsett first down at 15 now the ball back at the 48 yard line of West Virginia option left Cavanaugh keeping now pitches to Dorsett cutting inside at the 40 yard line Dorsett picking up eight or nine yards 43 Greg Anderson the free safety is senior at 190 makes the hit on Dorsett in the West Virginia secondary tony dorsett going for that magic 6,000 yard mark something that he'll have to really do or I have to really hustle to accomplish in something that could make the record untouchable here it is again Dorsett waiting in Cavanaugh doing a nice job waiting till the last moment endorsed of getting everything he can out of it as West Virginia played it very well second down and eight Cavanaugh rolling out past ahuntin Hutton with a great defensive play hit by Harold woods immediately at the 45 yard line and knocked back Hutton getting up kind of slowly as woods put a great hit on him and now Pitt is called timeout with one minute and 12 seconds left to play in the first half there you see Bobby Hutton very steady very versatile performer for the Pitt Panthers fills in for Dorsett sometimes a tailback he's filling in today for Elliott Walker who's injured at fullback just a reminder to join host bill Fleming for college football 76 tomorrow and every Sunday afternoon throughout the season as highlights of today's key NCAA football teams around the country are analyzed Panthers ready to go back on offense now it'll be third down and four yards to go the ball just inside the West Virginia 37 yard line Taylor and Jones split to the left Jones in the slot Taylor the wide receiver high formation in the backfield pitched the Dorsett running lap great defensive play breaking through number 43 Frank Anderson to drop Dorsett for a loss and that's the way you've got to play the options play the power sweep student body left Anderson number 43 s you look at him there the free safety a senior at six feet in 190 here it is again everybody to the right looks like the old USC OJ Simpson student body left and Anderson goes right through the block of Bobby Hutton to make the tackle a great defensive play the loss is back to the 41 yard line of West Virginia and it is now fourth down and eight Cavanaugh has found out what he wants to know we have 47 seconds left to go in the first half Pitt leading 14 to 3 it is fourth down and eight the ball at the West Virginia 41 yard line Taylor to the right Jones to the left split backs in the backfield fake the draw Cavanaugh looking for a receiver getting away from the pressure now throws complete to Corbett he's hit the ball at about the 40 yard line it appears as if West Virginia has recovered they have number one Harold woods made the hit on tight end Jim Corbett who had made the reception and Corbett is down on the ground as you see there fit trainer Tim Caron assisting him he really took a hit from Harold woods woods the cornerback is only 510 and 185 but boy he has really put some hit on some pit receivers today Cavanaugh here you see it again getting away from the pressure flipping the ball at Corbett who is covered by Anderson and here comes number one woods boom and the ball pops out I think woods helmet hit it but that's the least of Jim Corbett's worries right now Corbett there you see him still down and motionless and being attentive to we now have 36 seconds left to go in the Hat nearly a full minute West Virginia took over on the fumble recovery and they have a first intent at the Pitt 40yard line another their own 40 Lane woods gets back to about the line of scrimmage Randy Holloway with the pressure and will go back now to Chris Schenkel in South Bend there you see Corbett walking off the field of halftime as the clock now running down with 20 seconds left to play in the half we'll try and find out for you the nature of Corbett's injury and as we mentioned he could be a very key loss to the Pitt Panthers being their leading receiver Mountaineers were leading a clock run down now is we have seven six in the crowd starts to countdown now a timeout is called by West Virginia with just five seconds to go they were going to run a play I can't understand why they would call timeout letting the time run down that low play of the first half Kendra dropping back the clock continues to run with five seconds to pass until the fall kicked off by tip the ball falls incomplete at the pit 25yard line as the clock runs out and so okay at the end of the first half to the tumultuous war of an overflow crowd here in pit stadium the end of the first half of the Pitt Panthers leading the West Virginia Mountaineers 14 to 3 Purdue stormy day in Georgia the total that afternoon was a modest 101 yards but a new era in Pitt football was born two weeks later all of college football was asking about a young 160 pound Pitt freshman running back who shocked the nation's fans by rushing for 265 yards who was this freshman phenom his name of course was Anthony true Dorsett and today three years and some 5,000 yards later there isn't a football fan in America who doesn't know about Tony Dorsett he holds nine alltime NCAA records 27 alltime hit marks and repeat his statistical accomplishments would only serve as an injustice to his larger meaning to college football and Pitt football in particular they began playing football at Pitt eightysix years ago in 1890 and although Pitt has one of the most storied names in all of college football the university has never chosen to retire the number of one of its players but that ends today the number 33 will never again be worn in this Stadium by a pit and the shoes you wore in the baby game and you became the leading alltime in CWA runner will be coming in the trophy case in the athletic department no fit player will ever again wear number 33 because they're never again will be another Tony Dorsett Tony the game of college football has ever seen and we thank you for letting us be a part of it thanks Huck thanks for the memories the pit band playing a Broadway medley give my regards to Broadway a very familiar tune American music has gone through a lot of crazes and a lot of fads and that's what the pit man is doing in there for Hartman's today with top hat white tie and Tails and a Broadway melody Yankee Doodle Dandy the fat ass performing over the great George EMCO had to hit water polo is number one I guess that's what h2o means there on the banner they got all kinds of sports and colleges we're about ready to kick off for the second half West Virginia will be kicking off Jeff Fetty number ten bill Mackenzie number 33 set to kickoff back deep to receive for the Pitt Panthers on a nine Willie Taylor number 19 Bob Breuder Shanna's sure kickoff up around the 30yard line now let's meet the Pitt Panthers as they introduce themselves to you here on ABC Cavanaugh quarterback Youngstown Ohio Tony doors that running back from a local offensive ng Bob Marlin New Jersey running back Willie Taylor Y receiver Ronnie New Jersey where Jones Y received with Norfolk sales PA Jim Corbett tight in Erie Pennsylvania Corbett is all right he just had the wind knocked out of him he's back in a football game first and ten Cavanaugh to keeper Cavanaugh bus at the 45 buses the 50 yard line gets into West Virginia territory he turned that one up very quickly as he just half faked the pitched almost and moved it right up the field I'd say a Matt Cavanaugh is having a terrific day as we look at him once again on what's been his biggest play the option play he he fakes the pitch actually it looked like was gonna be part three of the triple option he faked the pitch and he turned up field he had a terrific first half 9 carries 65 yards at the rustic Department and he was 711 in the passing Department for 41 yards the ball is just across the 50 yard line in West Virginia territory it's another first down for the Panthers and again it's Kevin on the option Cavanaugh down to the 40 yard line pushed out of bounds across the 40 by number 47 Paul Jordan a free safety who was also injured in the first half and he's okay back in Cavanaugh keeps doing it they're trying to take Dorsett and the pitch away from the Panthers and Cavanaugh is taking advantage of it by running the football himself there he is the junior from Youngstown Ohio who has made a big difference to the football fortunes after the interview number one quarterback Robert higwood Robert hey good of course and Kevin on a split duty and in the Georgia Tech game this year Hagen was injured had a knee operation that was out for the season it's been on Cavanaugh's shoulders but he too was injured for a part of the year he's done magnificently dorset up the middle for short yardage 78 chuck smith on the tackle for West Virginia the ball short of the 35 yard line at the 36 a gain of two or three yards on the play we'll call it second down in seven which kind of points out that depth has been a very important thing for Pittsburgh and I think there's one factor in this game today I'd have to say that the Pittsburgh just a lot deeper than West Virginia yep got a question mark right along Cavanaugh brings the mouse second down and eight to the 36 yard line of West Virginia the Panthers on office just underway here in the second half 14 to 3 Pittsburgh Cavanaugh again options up crosses the 32 about the 28 yard line the tackle made by number 65 Joe gellick and the left linebacker number 50 Ken Culbertson the senior 210 pounder for the Mountaineers here it is again chopper oh I'll tell you even fun this option play today I used to run that up and play myself at the University of Utah you know there is a triple option what I did is that I eliminated part two I just went from part 1 Part 3 there you go you get the picture the only time you ran was out of bounds and out of sheer fright terror just short of the first down yardage they indicate just inches short the ball inside the 30yard line near the 27 yard line or a 28 yard line it is of the West Virginia Mountaineers 13 minutes 26 seconds remaining in the third quarter you know Mac Jones comes out excuse me and Randy rudesheim comes into wide receiver back in those days the quarterback had to play safety on defense and Jack Curtis used to tell me stay upper you line of 15 yards deep and retreat at the snap of the ball it is third down and just inches to go for a panther touchdown Cavanaugh trying to sneak it over the middle part is for Dorsett and they've gotten a lot of it for Cavanaugh this afternoon first and 10 they mark it at the 27 yard line of West Virginia the Pitt Panthers on the move with their opening possession here in the second half I formation in the backfield counter option Cavanaugh toe towards the corset at the 20 yard line down inside the 20 near the 15 bumped out of Bounce by Johnny shell number 13 the senior right side quarterback at 511 180 pounds he endorsed her about a to match physically I'll tell you when he accelerates you really get a sense of that 43.5 speed at time when he caught that ball he just gave it a little burst Tony Dorsett has now gone over the 100yard mark this afternoon he has about 102 yards I believe so far today and it is another Panther first down the ball is spotted at the 17 yard line of West Virginia Willie Taylor and Gordon Jones both comes foot to the mic high formation hunted and tore sit in the tailback fake to Hunton Cavanaugh Cavanaugh strap gonna be thrown for a loss number 50 can coerce and makes pressure along with 47 Paul George also over there 65 Joe chilly the blue card good defense by West Virginia on that play 18 straight 100yard games for Tony Dorsett 20 carries 102 yards two touchdowns it's just you know it's just another typical Tony Dorsett show it would be a great day for any backup we had a minute left to go in the game but we're just under way here in the third quarter and Dorset has passed the 100yard part again Taylor and Jones comes with wide to the right split backs in the backfield with Orson on the wing to the right it is second down and 11 yards to go from the 18 yard line Cavanaugh rolling out away from the pressure stops throwing into the end zone it's under thrown it bounces up in hits Willie Taylor and Cavanaugh was leveled right after he threw the ball Cavanaugh is still down and so is the West Virginia defensive player who made the hit try and pick up his number I believe it's seven eight Chuck Smith Snuppy Smith of West Virginia their top defender is down see and he appears to be in a great deal of pain I'll tell ya either he's no deed on stuff or Cavanaugh has got some very sharp elbows you see what happened I can't figure out why Smith is the one that winds up holding himself look as if Cavanaugh took the shot and apparently Smith must have landed wrong and they're working on as you could see his right knee I always tell you these quarterbacks are tough guys you know we got just calcified ribs it's being helped off the field number 78 for West Virginia their key defensive player and we certainly hope that he is alright this reminder to stay tuned at the conclusion of today's game for the Chevrolet offensive and defensive players of the game we'll be announcing them in the cupper will be in the booth really kind of wide open there have been some outstanding defensive plays and pretty steady defense on the part of both teams one thing the West Virginia is done I think covered they've taken the big play away from Pittsburgh Pitt has had to march on drives and chip away it 8 and 10 yard shots in order to get their two touchdowns so far it's a good point they're threatening now at third down and 11 at the 18 yard line of West Virginia split back to the backfield Cavanaugh",

gain 71 yards in the first quarter 63 yards of the second one touchdown Baylor averaging 225 yards per game rushing today only 54 Frank told you and Texas averaging 127 yards passing per game today have only four yards but they have they the margin on the scoreboard Mentalist counts nineteen to seven but makichan had gotten most of those past and he hasn't played the one played today and Fred Akers is holding him out until hopefully the Texas Bay in here ballgame if they don't need him in their second half we're not likely to see and now the four captains of the Texas Longhorns have been out on the field we want to name him George James Earl Campbell Brad sure number 77 that great lineman whom you saw so often in the first half is definitely a candidate for the Outland Trophy we feel like he's one of the best tackle feet man and Morgan Copeland is the fourth Texas Longhorn quarterback while for Baylor it's Gary Blair Tommy Davidson Ron Burns and Gary Hutchinson and that sign tells it all as far as Texas fans are concerned as far as the polls are concerned whether it be the coaches UPI or AP number one and there is the capital of a huge state this program is being brought to you as a special exclusive of ABC Sports let's pause five seconds till our local stations to identify themselves EB Waco television for region town all right thanks for identification glad to have all of

in to play the University of Michigan we have Thompson and Wyatt deep awaiting the kick by Jeff black number 15 there is of the Baylor Bears from Waco Waco the home of the Texas Ranger Hall of Fame and Museum during Waco be sure and visit it because they had such a big part in the history of Texas and the gamble to follow it'll be a touchback for the Texas Longhorns that was Wyatt from Texarkana Arkansas playing on the Texas team that looked at the ball and I was in his hello mini pounds but Earl Campbell was a big influence on Raylan to go to University of Texas they were good friends so here are the Longhorns now first and 10 they score two touchdowns in the first quarter failed on the point after scored another in the second went for two and failed so that's the 1907 score well as a 74yard beauty by Hawthorn that got the Baylor Bears on the scoreboard number six the quarterback Randy McEachern Randy a teacher who had an injury and thought that he'd be held out for the an M game as well he won't get rusty if he gets into action Randy must have felt that this game had gotten too close he's going into the teeth of the wind Cris and the wind has picked up in the last 15 or 20 minutes about 20 or 25 miles per hour and this was a forest field position Texas his hat during the entire two ball game all right it's going to be a second down and six from the 22 there he goes there you got an idea of this from strength and mainly balance Earl Campbell and these are the defenders that try to stop the Texas Texas team and actually they've done a very fine job Alan stone 99 is the defensive end whose number we've called Thomas Brown the defensive tackle number 90 Jimmy role in 97th offensive end and number 41 Charl number 95 there's Singletary number 63 of his he active now first and ten from the 34th of the Longhorns Campbell again for Moriarty let's take a look at the secondary it's done a great job on any of the passes to their few that they throw on today Howard bills is the cornerback the right quarterback is scooter read safety man Ron burns a very fine man a senior from Grand Prairie and Tommy green a junior from San Antonio Texas with a fiveyard gain it's going to be second and five now for a Texas Longhorns they have the ball at their own 39 13:23 remaining in the third quarter of play 19 to 7 is the score McEachern five foot nine inch ham Jones Chris that offensive line jeans and he loved it Hubert I'm really moving them out we have a final score Texas A&amp;M a whopping went over TCU they'll be invented for the long haul next week catering 620 Campbell 25 ham Jones 26 lamb Jones number two Albert Jackson who scored the first touchdown who comes to the near side of the field out of you at the bottom of your screen sit down a third down and one well the Longhorns get it McEachern called his own number he's from Pasadena Texas a senior number six and came into his own right because of injuries to other Texas quarterbacks in he impressed us in the Arkansas game 1100 spoonful all his native Texas someone out time house getting Darryl and Freddie we all give you a lot of quarterbacks 1100 they have to choose from and the Longhorns with another first down and those are the men up front Nikki sure there's a good look at it now for this all 46 stumbling was Campbell McEachern failed to get the ball to speedy Earl he just passed him by and that's the nose of the Goodyear blimp America that's Memorial Stadium in Houston Texas Cris football coaches focus on the offense ssunnah and they get to see the blocking develop and if our fans really want to see and going football to fit watch the offensive line they'll be able to see the back how the call of their I transfer to the University of Arkansas Fred Akers head coach first year of the Longhorns and this is Austin Texas not used to the other first down for the long arms and run burns covered number two Alfred Jackson he's from Caldwell a senior he's at tendinitis on the right knee and is a very speedy back coming in he had 11 catches it two touchdowns it was a simple out Adam to Alfred Jackson it has tremendous speed and the defensive cornerback was playing way off for the long face now from the failer 42 first down from the I pointed to the left split into the right lock it in Jackson away Campbell keeping it on the ground Mike Singletary whose picture you saw the middle linebacker few moments ago and we've isolated on him number 63 watching Singletary is the freshman they're in a splint snakes defense he takes on you but the offensive set up spins back around and gets his hands and shoulder pad older older pearl that was the voice of Frank Broyles father of four sons and twins is back there in fed the Arkansas seven Southwest Conference championships one national championship ten bowls what a record mmm James and Ingram I'll move in the defensive fail alignment back and given Earl a chance to make a lot of yardage and Alan stone and on along with

failure of about 10 and a half remaining in the third quarter my future trying to cross up the defense on the option faking pitch to number 25 am Jones so after a threeyard gain by the quarterback it'll be second down and seven he was stopped by brow of angels of technics angle third angleton I was they have anything did you ever get a player out of committee not Singletary after a hard hit on Campbell on the previous play must have twisted his ankle he excuse me out of the lineup for the moment with a second down at 7 from the Baylor 28 nexus with a wall leading 1970 Jackson gets it at about the 80 now first down for the Longhorn and there again you see their variety the versatility of their attack that's what they've been doing all season long is when the team crowds their running

carried on to play a second down and four and it's right near the forward stake as Paul hearse 53 of 33 Jerry Harrison he made the stop textin has used up nearly seven minutes of this third quarter going into the teeth of a 20 mile an hour wind and they're trying to cap an 80yard Drive but again at the 20 now they have a first and goal at the 7 Jackson number 2 to the left that's head coach Freddie Akers Mike Lockett is to the right number 47 from the 7 first and goal and Kimble broke away momentarily gained about 2 yards of the second goal as Joe Campbell of Baylor made the stop again

football Thanksgiving Day on ABC and there she is the Goodyear blimp America above Austin Texas and more specifically Memorial Stadium and the Longhorns have it at the baylor 43 first down following a punt from the end zone looseball Campbell at the ball but did he keep it no second time now today that his public curse they're keying on him and believe me when they key on that the hips her heart is a replay he never got to handle it was a trap play right up the middle he was looking where he was going to run in the quarterback hit him high above the numbers and he fumbled the ball Lester Ward recovered he's the freshman from Temple Texas so Baylor very good they got it at the 43 they gained two yards on that exchange so let's see what would the quarterback will do that was both Taylor a sophomore from Dallas number five covered by number three Derek hatchet act was the wall cold to dressing but he runs on the sprint relay team but Texas he's been tied to nine four in the hundred and he ran with Taylor shoulder to shoulder and it was no chance to completed pace alright so it'll be a second down at 10:00 with 3:45 permitting in the third quarter bill lights are on from the 43 of Baylor they trail seven to 22 and around up Texas defense including Bradsher number 77 number em Campbell 8086 Tim camel right and Lance Taylor 32 all the heckling the whole colored line of the defense the defense is cranked up oh yeah really fired up now so still at the 43 it's going to be a third down attempt for the Baylor Bears what Tim campbell chasing him but he cuts it off incomplete covered on the play was number 82 Ronnie Glee Derek hatchet number 3 covering Ronnie Lee solve Chris bridge will come in again recruited to Baylor on a baseball scholarship the punter still plays baseball deston those fans cheer that defense all that swells them up I'll go out play much harder though number 27 deep for the Longhorns that's Johnny Johnston looking at it at the 13 far the man on the move that hit him first was number 26 Griffin a defensive back so now the Texas Longhorns are going to have the ball first exam at their own 18 we're going to take this pause and then return to Austin Texas if we're going to have a future in our environment we're going to have to clean up the water bill Draper wastetreatment supervisor this is who we are and what we do at General Motors we analyze the wastes determine what chemical charges we'll have to put in it to break out the impurities it goes to a chemical mix tank to the air quotation system which causes the impurities to float to the top we skim that oily layer off then it goes to a clarifier and from that stage the water is clear in some space that we get out of the river when we keep them there from school kids will show that our water will support fish life and we're not doing harm in the river general motors people building transportation to serve people we're back in Austin 256 remaining third quarter Texas leading 22 to 7 they have the ball first and ten at their own 18 Randy McEachern 26 lamb Jones is to the left number 2 Jackson to the right Cambell carrying on the play thus far today 25 carries and with three yards on that play nine yards on the game and on Monday night in a big week of football on AVC it begins at 9:00 Eastern ABC's NFL Monday Night Football Washington five and four against the Green Bay Packers second down and seven while the Longhorns leading 22 to seven McEachern Campbell and that was how it feels it was quickly there to cover pulling to block as he usually does was Rick Ingram number 73 Singletary also went on the tackle hey thanks some speed guards with speed to get out in front and become a lead block for Earl Campbell and Yarborough and Ingram both have that type of speed that coaches are looking for there's a isolation old single parent number 63 the young freshman line back to that grand pass there's gonna be one of the best that they've had here he is firing through the line making the tackle old Earl down so third down third down and six so on a third down and six Lam Jones the speedster gets the first down and let's why on the replay the timing has to be perfect to pull the line back to retreats in the sold lamb Jones catches the ball in front head back in behind the linebacker and nearly gets loose for long run so now it's of first attempt as we get a better look who represented our country at Montreal and was in on the 400meter relay victory from the 41st down and McEachern number six keeping on the play now we have one minute remaining in the third period of play Texas leading 22 to 7 dope field made the tackle he is the freshman from Burnett Texas and look at the Sun setting out here in the southwest painting prettier than that after that two yard gain we have a second down and eight from the 43 Texas with the ball from their eye Colorado beating Kansas State today 23 to nothing McEachern Alfred Jackson pulling the ball in there's Jackson who scored the first touchdown for Texas West number 33 Harrison covering him Harrison was covering but there was a fake to Campbell and Jackson breaks outside after pushing deep the success of this play Chris defends a bunt attack some speed the push deep to get field to retreat like it's gonna be a long play and then break it off in front of him to keep your head up all right old party all right in Jackson with a problem now on the Texas bench for his team they have advanced to the 39 but they'll play it from the other end as time has run out here in the third quarter with the Longhorns leading by a score of 20 to 7 the fourth quarter coming up Texas band that's been playing from the very start in their undefeated season Blairmore them the computer

snap of the fourth quarter with Texas leading 22 to 7 we had a 21yard field goal by McMichael in the third quarter thus the score McEachern is the quarterback here's the snap from the 39 of Baylor and Campbell again drawing first Thomas Brown number 90 on the play and two or three and the other Baylor bear defenders that we might add with Phil needs of three points scored in the third quarter Frank royal the favored defense hasn't done that poorly here today we're gonna pat him on the back they have a lot of pride they've been successful against the run all year long fumbles by the Baylor team give in Texas good field position have been the difference in the ball game that's Lockett coming out of the ball game Alfred Jackson is okay you recall earlier he was shaken up and now his team has a second and six from the 35 that's Sam Jones carrying on the play you gonna make a great runner a great player with the blockers in the backfield they have to be very unselfish ma'am Jones certainly is one of them Frank he's been making the key block in the practically every ball game is bring girls Campbell loose into the secondary he's the lead blocker almost Pharos runs we have 14 minutes and 11 seconds remaining in our game here in Austin Texas the Longhorns leading the Bears of Baylor 22 to 7 now it's a third down a little more than 1 for the first down at the Baylor 30 Hubert snapping the ball to McEachern and going for the first down was ham Jones number 25 so the Longhorns keeping this drive alive having started at the 18 their biggest drive today was 80 yards and 16 plays consuming 9 minutes and 2 seconds on the clock Frank Broyles hey that's the longest time of possession of the drive that I've seen this year hey I'm Jones has 52 yards and Tim fries in attempts or 5.2 yard efforts when he's not blocking he's had a busy day speedster lamb Jones is in Lockett is out from the 27 of Baelor first down good rush put on McEachern by number 46 don't field of Burnett Texas the freshman so it'll be a second down in ten here the third quarter stance Texas of course way ahead now 18 first downs to eighth time of possession is the real key 13 minutes 43 seconds for Texas 1417 for Baylor in that is real that's the real story 1333 to go in the ball game going to the far side number 47 Lockett number 2 Jackson who is the split end Lockett is in the slot on a second and 10 McEachern the quarterback trying to cut away was Earl Campbell but fine defensive play by number looked like number 97 Rowell the sophomore six to 250 pounds so it's going to be a third down intent now I can see why many of the Western artists come out here to paint those lovely pictures what a sunset here in Austin and a beautiful day for football third down at ten wide set backs this time Campbell and Jones and Jackson just enough yardage for the Texas first down Griffen making the stop number 26 from Athens Texas a sophomore playing for Baylor and we have a Baylor bear player injured as now McEachern has completed five of six at number 48 Rick R and a junior from Dallas Texas we invite you to stay tuned at the conclusion of the game for the Chevrolet offensive and defensive

happy because her team Texas leading 22 to 7 now with a first and ten at the baylor 16 and driving is sure he had a hole but the rest of the yardage was hard earned by him he just ricocheted through there behind the blocking of James and Ingram and Hubert the entire Texas line chris is a thing of joy and beauty to watch for a football coach they are getting movement where the Texas backs now can make their cuts on this defensive side of the football and not in their own back teeth a major in communications Earl Campbell so was Tony Dorsett or Dorsett at Pittsburgh last year second and about five as Campbell carried getting nerd to that forward stake for a first down as Ingram again the left guard number 73 made the hole this last year Earl Campbell was called a number of times for jumping the snap count he anticipates and gets such a start that the officials many time called him in motion when he was and that's what happened on this last play Percy Penn is the referee and there is a penalty being marked off now against Texas and here's the reason why the legal ship in the backfield and frankly yes verifying what you have said everybody complained but we all thought it had looked at them the Earl most the time was legal he just starts fastest Mario pobedy so it is a second down in ten lamb Jones out of the lineup locative number 47 Baylor up there in their basic 43 defense you see it right there very graphically go field again ends offensively for the Baylor Bears and reminding you at the conclusion of this game be sure and want to listen to the ABC News special

flanked to the far side and down the middle and he run grace and lamb Jones can outrun you all right let's watch McEachern mind is man he brought back and Jackson crossed into the middle behind the linebackers in front of the safety and there was nobody home because Baylor plays a man command secretary also remember Jackson is not as fast as lamb Jones the Olympic gold medal winner this team has

the defensive and offensive players of the game well I don't think is any question offensive this Earl Campbell and defense Lee Brad show standing deep down for Baylor number 27 in the end zone Gregg Hawthorne who is told very wisely by our 16 Buckley not to run it out and there's the man who has just won and his efforts thousanddollar scholarship not to the athletic department to the general scholarship fund and $1,000 in this man's name as well Brad sure he said both have had four outstanding years at University of Texas ranchera Kenneth Outland Trophy Award to Chris Wright in tackles already this ballgame but a marker down came from the 20 and the run goes across the 25 to about the 28 it was Frank Pollard number 30 on the carry let's look at the offensive player of the game again Earl Campbell Earl the Pearl DiPaola rolls defensive play of the game Brad Shara the defensive tackle as Kim tackles $1,000 go away award the University of Texas College and Earl Campbell with one touchdown 30 carries today 181 yards when an offside against the Texas defense declined so because of a nineyard gain at second down and one first down for the Baylor Bears and a collision here in the heart of Texas whoo Mark Martin only the hit linebacker a free linebacker on the weak side collision Greg whoop the quarterback where the Greg is knocked unconscious with his back looks like wow that's some salted water won't wash off we look at Earl Campbell we have 6 minutes and 6 seconds remaining in the game the 67th meeting between the Southwest Conference schools Texas leading 29 to 7 I was asked to talk about the incredible Black and Decker workmate there's almost nothing it can't hold but the word mate is so incredible I'm gonna let it do the talking the workmate from Black &amp; Decker and nobody else but America has a job to do it reaches from Black &amp; Decker your car will always need new parts but you will never need to buy another battery once you own the JC Penney's f it never needs water ever and it has more power to start your car than any other car battery so dependable it's fully warranted for as long as you own your car if it ever failed returning will replace it free only a JCPenney Auto standard or catalog debt it's the last battery your car will ever need live and direct here in Austin Texas we have the along with the our ABC crew here in Austin covering the game and the Texas Longhorns twenty nine two seven late can French at least a tie with the end M gang yet to be played but all speculation would be that Notre Dame will be playing Texas in the Cotton Bowl okay Roger we appreciate your help and giving us this news from the Notre Dame campus and all of us wish you well over cotton ball and hope to see you soon so there you have it another day has accepted a bit moments ago to play in the Cotton Bowl in Dallas first I'm very happy for the noted Notre Dame coaching staff urban counsel dear friend of mine is offensive coordinator Dan Devine has been on a little bit of criticism but he's certainly acted with a great football team and I'm very happy for him and for six people in Dallas are very excited about the they match up between maybe Texas or Texas A&amp;M and Notre Dame but in the Sugar Bowl we've got a game going to with Ron and Woody Hayes can you imagine that and of course unfortunately Greg wood of Jackson Mississippi the sophomore quarterback for Baylor shaking up quite badly and we're going to see again just how he was hit he was dropping back to pass Chris and the receivers were covered Mark Martin Tony makes a just a pictureperfect tackle right there where they shoulder pad and hit gear coming right under the shoulder pad is up int the property his job now the same trouble thing is a Greg wood was knocked unconscious last weekend so that is our concern the Baylor coach's Bevo number 10 the mascot of Texas taking a pause and that's what we're going to do six minutes left in the game 95.7% that's how many Chevy trucks back to the 1967 models were still on the job as of July 1st 1976 repeated 95.7% were still on the job this is based on industry data for the 10 most recent model years recorded heavy flux built to stay tough you know a fireman's fund says for the best insurance look for our fire hat but there's another symbol just as important it belongs to the man who sells our insurance the independent agent because he represents not just us but many fine companies to get you the very best deal around so even if you forget our symbol remember this one of the man who serves you first your independent agent he's got the one symbol it pays you to know in the yellow pages fireman's fund insurance companies we're back again Memorial Stadium and unfortunately Greg wood the sophomore quarterback is being carried from the playing field on a stretcher after a lengthy observation on the field and our first opportunity we will find out just what the condition of this fine young quarterback is right now a tactical situation on the field is this but the 35 Greg wood that made the first down on a tremendous run but then was hit hard Scott Smith as his replacement number 11 a freshman from Dallas Texas so from the 35 he pitches out to Hawthorne who throws a forward pass intended for 19 Tommy Davidson said all avail so it'll be a second down and Johnny Johnson covering on the play and Frank our sugar ball with a home state accepting the Sugar Bowl bit they'll go against Alabama two coaches that have phenomenal records hey O'Brien is the third winners coach of all time and actually he's getting close to the whole time corrected of the line Amos Alonzo Stagg and Woody Hayes as a fourth win his post the football they'll be against each other on Optus Argentina to the ball on you all in Seoul January of the second Greg Hawthorn for the Baylor Bears number 27 carried on the play on a second and 10 Morgan Copeland made the tackle and let's see where the officials they spot it at the 38 and it's going to now bring up or Baylor a 3rd down and 7 the report on the quarterback Greg wood and undetermined neck injury and we hope sincerely that it is nothing serious Steve Massey came in on Scott Smith the freshman quarterback who replaced the injured Greg wood and because of the defensive play now a loss to the 31 a loss of 7 it's going to be a punting situation for Luke Crestridge of Houston the sophomore punter fourth down and 14 Johnny Johnson is deep for Texas snapping the ball is buzzy Nelson number 58 he does that on the long snaps a wobbler taken by Johnson but not for long as he stopped on the 41 so the Longhorns leading by score of 29 to 7 have 4 minutes and 42 seconds to show us more of their offensive might here at Memorial Stadium in Austin don't forget immediately following this game as we're running long ABC News special hosted by Harry Reasoner the visit of president Sadat to Israel we saw their earlier coverage today and it was a tremendous ABC News presentation cidade is courageous going to Israel for a hopeful of lasting peace in the Mideast Ted Constanzo an hour quarterbacking or the long Lord sending off to Jimmie Johnson who is in the backfield so we've had three quarterbacks used by Freddy acres today Constanza was a very heralded high school football player came to Texas as a misfortune adversities and predict was for a redshirt in this year of the cause of injury to Hertz Laban he had to go in and do the punting and now he's playing some quarter Bama if you just joined us on a direct telephone connection to Roger Valdiserri of Notre Dame they announced that Notre Dame has accepted a bid to the Cotton Bowl and of course the winner of the Southwest Conference will be their opponent Texas and having the upper hand thus far they have Texas and in the underplay but they lead here twenty nine to seven as Jimmie Johnson carried on a second and six enough for the first down and a Doak field made the stop along with Kevin Griffin of ethicist Texas Freddie hey Freddie Akers got a good job at the half get this Texas team ready to come back Baylor has zero yardage well this time in Texas has close to 240 holders alright coming of the veers side is my clock at number 47 Constanza is the quarterback for the Texas Longhorns 329 left in the game and a pick pileup was there a loose ball it was like gralen Wyatt who's replaced roll Campbell he's from Texarkana Arkansas and it appears that the Baylor Bears have come up with a third turnover by the Texas Longhorns 20 seconds remaining in the Washington Washington State game the Huskies leading 35 to 15 to keep their Rose Bowl hopes alive now they could wait and watch the game the old Friday night on ABC to see if they will be the Rose Bowl

couple and he is going to be one of the great coaches of all time he played on the same football team with Barry Switzer 195859 raise the back key oh good I was just get daddy I was gonna ask you to school Franklin so now we have a second down in 20 after that oneyard gain beau Taylor in the lineup see Byrne got the handoff and Mark Hamilton number 90 made the stop on the play and that'll bring up a bunt down and with the ball at the 39 a gain of five would be third down and 15 for the Baylor Bears see Byrne has carried five times today 20 yards to 19 left in the game and it seems like this game is going on forever going nearly three hours Oh a pass by Scott Smith's at number 82 running late oh I can't believe it the first time this year I've seen officials all that particular type of play of puzzle most the time they call an incomplete face his fifth hit the receive a deep downfield he was tackled by the Texan safety man rolling back in and dropped the fifth Baylor turnover and number one ranked Texas gets the ball again first and ten at the 33 knocking it loose was Nance Bedford from Beaumont Texas number 41 extras has all they're stuck a defensive unit involved game with mi stupid by John ball team what a beautiful pitch out to Braylon wild number playing with a nikon stands up very little gain on the play perhaps two yards out to the 35 there you gonna look at

  "transcript": "the reserve center of USC football first down they'll be running the option series with some power on leach is the quarterback I don't know whether Huckabee will be starting his mail back with Checketts it is widel a sail back and Davis at fullback Vidal can go both ways Smith and Stephenson are the wide receiver first ever Michigan honors Leisha the lefthander's the beer series and a straight option team he keeps the ball the pitch is delighted 30 35 and out to the 30 play David Lewis the outside linebacker brought him down a gain of eight it's kind of the way you draw it up got a good block by gene doesn't the radiate that time the offensive line very adroit blocking line bill doofus is the wrong side tackle 6b is Donnie huge are downing the center one of the best dar is the right guard and Ken is the right back laughing around second down to Lydell at the thirty eight thirty eight and a half by Rod Martin the weakside linebacker rod Lila broke Tom Harmons alltime season rushing record or career record and Johnson's season rushing record this year he's the alltime ground gainer for many of the fine backs who's washed up and down for Michigan third down a yard to go on the 38 yard line in Michigan still in there I formation we're just underway no score that's Davis he has a first down as he butts his way to the 41 Russell Davis very strong a sophomore from Woodbridge Virginia average trip miss Michigan offense dawn was so potent this year they all averaged about six yards of carry that's the kind you like the hell you got they're good offensive line and the quickness of both coaches have been talking about the really going to have a great running game this guy doesn't have to throw that much Schembechler says we throw when we want to not when we have to first down Michigan under 41 David oh yeah for the 46 on a quick opener that's the triple option the first man through the fullback then the quarterback can keep he has the option to run or pitch out to the trailing tailback three options on the play Carroll steal the middle guard full Russell Davis down on the 47 yard line of the Wolverines second down four we have three minutes gone no score Michigan playing the type of ball they want right now controlling it they have averaged 38 points the game this year number one in the nation second down for Leake he has a first down fumble well the fans say USC has it referee says the same thing Kearney was a bubble leak does that Matthews on his the linebacker all right there you see they're all coming in Roger made the hip and linebacker Clay Matthews of Kenilworth Illinois jumped on it USC first down on her own 42 and our first mistake of the game is charged to Michigan quarterback 107 Evans to Rickey Bell Bell what get out and get to the 46 of Michigan and he had it there Mike Robinson is replaced Blandy Simran that's a very important move by USC will tell you about Simmons our first receiver he has a bad knee and he's not starting then seven to the quarterback number eight dave farmer 15 to pull back Rickey Bell 40 to the tailback gay is the tide in Diggs and Robinson to the wide receiver second down seven Rickey Bell again there's a hole for him and he's living out of bounds on the USC 48 yard line Dwight Hicks and Jerry Bogle a number 39 took him out third down and poor for USC look at rookie bells figures last year top ground gainer in America eighteen hundred yards a little over this year injuries stop TV but a one game 347 yards in one game against Washington State almost unbelievable mmm 51 carries in that game third down and 4 USC under 48 no score first period Evans on a roll out foot passes complete bill Goethe six he has a first down I think Michigan usc's plan is to go right atom inside the tackles Michigan is very quick covering the outside and short controlled passing to control his ball thanks though Tucker because really that's not much more dangerous than a run when you look at it the chances they're going to have an interception is very slim if it's big complete they come back and try to get again short passing is open 1140 to go in the first period no score told you the first ball on the Michigan 45 rookie Belle Belle jammed at the 41 of Michigan hit there by John Anderson the Wolverines flopped their players Tedesco Morton vocally and Bouldin the two linemen a wide linebacker and a wide side halfback all go on the open side of the field to cover the most round I figure they're the best and quickest defensive players simmer now has come in the two food is also in at fullback and Mike Robinson is out now simran has a bad knee but he was running very well in passing drill to the excellent receiver number 18 that fell 30 have 40 getting to the 35 a Michigan may have the first down Rickey Bell he's pulled down by Gerry's uber the Wolfpack take a look I think we have an over commitment on the right side of the linebackers team in but I figured up on the stream if you saw great blocks in the outside and the wolf man does come in they can move with that plate really I think was designed to go in between those blocks Kurt he saw it closed up bounced out to the outside and picked up the first down Rickey Bell is injured helping him off o be a blow to USC Bell had a bad ankle the last part of the year I thought the rest was completely heal it will have a quick report on him and now we have a timeout on the officials well at gain 16 yards in the first four times he carried the ball so rookie bells to the sideline nil attending and freshman sensation Charlie White Charles white number 12 will replace him at tailback White has probably more speed elusiveness but doesn't have the power of L nor the experience first down USC on the Michigan 35 10 and a half minutes to go in the first period no score roll out Evans looking lifts up he completed the 8 yard line Shelton digs caught the ball number 26 the flankers from San Bernardino California covered by they linebacker Buckley and Jerry Zuber the will flan 28 yard line of Michigan a seven yard advance second down and three ten minutes remaining in the first period both teams are sparring each other very cautiously coming up to the line of scrimmage taking their time slot left formations good quick over first include the two for the cake the white and they give it to mostly to to fo from Honolulu you've got this is that all set the middle you see a good block in the middle by Hickman who comes across great open it up at a house in the middle that quick hitting is pretty good little nifty ball handling back here to back John Henderson was the gun it was it on a major thrust to stopping that villain they sent Robinson left and dick to the right simmer and Doc girls whites the tailback deep in the eye Evans will throw it maybe now he starts to run he flips away can't find anybody Faison the tailback in high school and also LA City College before they turn him into a quarterback here got some good inside pressure there he's trying to hit a quick pass as he's thrown a couple of times that was graves in the middle that was kind of calling some problems white Hicks was the guy that comes aces him down the other side and puts it together that was a good move Kirk that's that I think we can see Rick leach through something very similar that before the day is over both good running quarterback USC has had the ball he plays in his drive locked right formation second down three from the Michigan 13 and whistles go down look like blurs emotion to me Don let's quickly go down to Barbara Hunter and see what's the matter with Ricky Bell Curtis they say in football apparently Ricky had his bell rung he was hit in the head there now applying a night attack to the back of his neck it doesn't look as if it's something that's going to keep him out of the game and we'll get back to you as we get more information all right Barbara we're glad it's not his ankle he was hobbled with that bad ankle the last part of the season you hate to see an outstanding player like Ricky Bell injured in this final game rule at least showing his worst you fans across America the motion Penley ball start goes back to the 18 yard line in Michigan his second down eight that's our first penalty of the game only one turnover that was charged to Michigan no score lot right Evans to Charles white regards and didn't see a lot of playing time he'll be the next great tailback at USC history look you see a start for the right little delay potion he's following had Howell out in front great pulling guard there big hole Kurt he does have the moves finisher Hilton he got that much room to run him he's the typical USC sale back running a hundred and round nine five nine six and the Michigan man down we're going to have a timeout here in the Rose Bowl the score Michigan nothing USC nothing has and what a TV and put out again girls white and Dave farmer to tight ends the two fools in here the blocking back that's white he gets to the five maybe nudging over to five and you can see how quick the Michigan team is as they move that time very quick off the mark look like white might I'll get down to the two yard line but they quickly plugged him up it's second down five to go for a USC touchdown Caledonia you see that number 96 the middle of your screen getting the divisive signals from the sideline but the coaches Michigan State and USC think he's one of the better linebackers in the comics football today Cambodia the two flew the fullback Charles white the tailback better than five to go for USD touchdown Charles widened for a yard or yard loss great charge air by John Henry the short side defensive tackle number 70 will watch this defense e line get off the ball for Michigan there ray Fernandez Tennessee you mentioned Kurt's right look at it come through the number 71 and he as barmen pounds Blokland he moved Marvin right back in the middle of that backfield anytime you can break up that flow that timing is these guys work on so often that's what gives the other guys a chance to come in and make the time third down six to go for a USC touchdown now they go to a slot right formation typical coming in motion Evans will throw I'll jump in the gear down and six Michigan thought they had the ball the player had their plan but they don't the receiver was hit as he was trying to catch the ball incomplete really very good coverage skirt you see good protection here to begin with the food the food boot comes out on the outside that's just really very alert that's holding this up there number 22 Jim Boulden was right on his man Paul was never caught hurt that's a good comment for that Michigan defense they're known as the offensive football but that was a nice defensive stay in the end yes there was it may be very important to the blen Walker we get 10 out of 19 field goal just for the 23 yarder this is up Oh no the kickers go away and a first for gold fill us the message and Rob Lydell a tailback Rick leached the quarterback Michigan's ball first down on their own 20 Davis drops at the 23yard and he's hit by plane Matthews who calls the defenseless signals the inside linebacker for USC number 16 he does call him and that might have something to do with why he always knows where to go because he's right there in the middle playing over a block reckless abandon I believe they call that so your head out there and get it done Michigan moves the ball very well the first time they had the ball Kurt this is the second possession for them starting off three deep their own territory they have not thrown a pass yet second down seven from their 23 that's Lydell Idol 225 vitals to the 27yard line it again by Clay Matthews and the other outside linebacker David Lewis it's almost unbelievable a man can average 7 yards every time he carried the ball 203 carries this year for idols throwing for 3 yards of losses an average 7 yard to carry and scored 15 touchdown from Fremont Ohio the family owns a clothing store there Don and I try to work the wholesale deal with him yesterday but couldn't do it I swap stories about he said I used to work at clothing stores ourselves he sold the same kind of goods we did third down and two from Michigan from there 28 yard line no score first period five and a half to go look at the pitches arrival first down narrow shaft on the fields that Michigan seems to use their tail backs when they turn up and Johnny Robinson hold on to me that's what we've got to stop that tunnel of about ten yards wide Murray turns up the field some facts have that ability to accelerate when that tunnel opens up that you're talking about and Rob tidal is I am totally legitimate for for in the 40 and that's picking him up put him down he did see that little opening and slice down the middle the slot taken of a big first Derek hurt him Smith the wingback first down at Michigan on there 39 it's the Jim Smith on a reverse no dancing away comes up short of he's 45 Smith probably it'll be played on a passing team with the renowned man in America receiving path let's go down to report on Jerry silver from Barbara Hunter Kirtland Zuber left the field he was on a stretcher he looked as if he were in mobile at that time however the trainer has told me that he was conscious at the time he was taken from the field he did not go to a hospital he simply went to the locker room for examination and they promised to keep in touch with us to let us know the status of his injury thank you Michigan on their 44 yard line no score in this game running out of their iformation leach to Davis the first man get some extra yardage fighting hard for the 49 in Michigan they have a first down may not as close Rob Martin tackled him the senior outside linebacker number 52 I tell you you watch we're going to take some real looks today at this Center he is probably the forgotten man in football the offensive center but you're looking at a man that they walk down a number 72 on Michigan who USC says is the finest blocking center they've ever seen and they said we marvel at him after our scouting film they're taking a look at it good a bit down a little bit Gerald Ford is all about he played in a hurry for Travis president for today watching you in the Senate could be President sounding someday who knows worse down Michigan around there 49 yard line USC's had one threat they missed the 23 yard field goal quickly sophomore get through throw number 59 charged roof and nailing the lot is in there today he may play a lot as a third linebacker you got a look at his Matthew's trying to read the placed a lot of the guy that come through big Walt Underwood six for 220 s in there also but a little bit too long to throw Kurt when he had the ball he'd actually had a guy that was open downfield but they don't throw that much we talked about earlier didn't have a deep enough dropped enough they didn't get to fall off second down 17 from Michigan there's a draw play and out to the 45 yard line is Russell Davis of Michigan where Rob Martin Taylor rod did a good job play the outside saw the ball go to the inside made a good move to come to the inside let's watch downing do a job on his man watching for 72 days in contact feet moving Benzema that's what he's supposed to do excellent excellent job Joe ship and the number 82 moved in the tight end position we may have the first pass for Michigan now it is leach dropping rip is open liars back and he had crossing back as Russell Davis Davis was coming back from the right side to the left sideline he was open but the ball was beyond it all right now this is Smith this is Jim Smith but the guy you're talking about Curt that has the speed the moves they say it could be another flints one but he is wide open downfield the plate was the design play comma delay he was going to Smith the end all the way coming down the back field trying to pick up the first down didn't see Smith it all downfield John Anderson the tide in will punt he's averaged 41 yards to kick and he rushed on that one any slice of it it's out of bounds inside the USC 30 the USC 28 yard line where the Trojans will take over what 221 remaining in the first period it is still USC nothing Michigan nothing under 28 yard lines in seven senior quarterback from Greensboro North Carolina he has them spread out the toss this to Charles white white is contained you can see how difficult it is to run outside on Michigan babble O'Neal number 96 drove him out of balance and O'Neal really read that play right here's O'Neal in the middle you see thick he watches Reeves that pitch up drops back there's no pass that's his angular pursuit that's the bad as good as you can do you something for a couple of yards gained on a situation like that's not bad at all remember when these two call Gale Sayers magic yeah well Charles white sensation sensation number twelve the tailback and Don Robinson his coach likens him to Terry Metcalfe good quick this up the middle about where the flag down to to foo don't see for toufu hitting up the middle we have a flag down we've had only one penalty so far all right while they're talking about this penalty barber later report on rookie Bell yes Kurt it looks like bad news for SC right now because Rickey Bell had said it they say it was not a leg it was not an ankle he simply had his bell rung that he is not in very good condition and they're taking him to the locker room apparently for the rest of his half the leading ball carrier with John Robinson Clark calls may be the best allaround football player he's ever seen he was a fullback then at tailback he can run over you he can block you and not taking any chances with a concussion and he is now being taken to the USC locker room a 15 yard offensive holding penalty against USC get them back to their 16 yard line roll out by Evan on the run Jonathan Diggs has it and Diggs goes down in his 24 yard line right on top of him it's one of those passes that you see a quarterback throw it he said get rid of it get rid of it because they're right behind you he did at the very last minute and Diggs was actually wide open downfield ball was a little bit under throwing he had to drop to his knees to pick it up here's the final score in the Cotton Bowl Houston beat Maryland 30:21 Pittsburgh crushed Georgia today in the Sugar Bowl their undefeated untied they were voted number one coming in we'll see what they do in his all winner of this game matches up against the two coaches first I saw Robinson now both the effective pull used to weigh 210 he's down to 180 good to lose some weight he looked very good yesterday I was very pleased to see that third down and 14 USC under 24 the to food now we gonna work with that one today they're to food gonna be very done with this then he'll now standing key with you and I working on his name all day but let's look at most it's a to prove coming through the middle with a great block in that middle there but not on the center panel and Hickman those that front three guys the center the two doors open it up for it well he's a yard short on mostly is first he gave almost a game back he gave heckled africo did Lee Lynn Walker is that only 11 of his 54 kicks returned this year he kicks very high five second hang time white Hicks and Jim Smith our back has safety men there it is not too good that and a fair catch called on the 35 yard line by Hicks in ball first time

gosh Toby's not hurt you know that guy really does cover some ground a hurry Kurt that thing looked like a very simple little option play they tried to force least the pitch he did Lionel was out there he was turning the corner already you see a quick fake in the middle of Davis came out there trying to play it off at Davis Lewis is out there number 57 lifted out to the Lydell and he came on it looks like he hurt himself right there when he fell that was Harold steel that came over from his middle guard position rocky now balanced third down and a half yard to go for Michigan two tight ends during Johnson and Fergie Videl stays then he's alright leach Oh he hit by Mario Delano who just came in and has made another important tackle our USC a junior from Manhattan Beach California has rich dimmler number two there was also in there so you got dinner to Bernie to his to Lana look at that flame they both just broke through they take number 92 stimbler Solana still wear to go forth down to the yard John Anderson and Confirmation Dennis Thurman the safety man number seven for USC they go after him hey boom done quick a touchback that's really close first down on her own 20 we're going to take a quick timeout here from Pasadena to tell you it is still nothing nothing I'm concerned now but I think seob are I'm concerned too but it's because that Trojan horse back up to you card and on first bound us C deficiency Charles white white spinning to the twenty three flag is down incidentally OJ joined my mainland Marika's in the club you read about it by men Watchers of America two thousand women voted Simpson the only athlete in there holding against USC and God Meredith and I mean there were some glamorous people movies fires leaders of the world these women said these are the ten best men to watch know what would that mean but they they had a bad scouting report on you they said you have broad shoulders I do you do I do have broad shoulders it's just narrow hips and then legs and things accentuate those and they said you look like a teddy bear nice to work with a teddy bear that's right a little teddy bear don't you believe it nine yard line where USC will put the ball and play their own nine a first down doctor last drive was it holding penalty how they really set back Kurt 21 to go Joey meters into the linebacker girls white and they contain him as they try to get outside continually unless he's done much better running inside the tackles against Bishop Calvin O'Neill Jim pickin tackle Charles white the ball is on the 16yard line of USC the coach Johnny Robinson heard down 14 Chuck Taylor and his rookie year took as a head coach to the Stanford team to the Rose Bowl Johnny Robinson done in his rookie year here at USC 13 14 477 they brought girls wipe down right now us he's not getting any Running Room and they're going to have to go into the front formation let's see make a move he slipped inside that's Otis page number 78 that's blocking him he's looking inside charge Greg Morton 6 to 225 senior let me correct myself down third down third down and 14 I'm going to roll out throw the faith path early that really was supposed to be a safe path it was the Shelton dick and it nearly popped into the hand they really did it hasn't been a team has scored on Michigan since that upset to Purdue's last two ball clubs Illinois and Ohio State got zip so they've continued that through the first quarter here today they looked very strong when Walker the oldest player in the field at the age of 24 used to be a guard in a prison well punch Jim Smith's a single safety man back in his own territory look out block we got enough balls for the fair catch on the 50yard line the 13yard to return either kick high or away from him and Mike jolly went in there and nearly blocked that kick for Michigan next Sunday John I'll be right back here in Pasadena the Rose Bowl Super Bowl 11:00 Hilton Raiders Ken Stabler and the Minnesota Vikings their quarterback plan targeted will have grandstand special Super Bowl preview at 2:30 Eastern Time and Don and I'll be on hands where all the actions beginning at 3:30 giving whether Super Sunday he followed a great block by Mark Donohue MEPs guard pulled out and led that one kind of an influence play you see that role that place charges the lift libel comes back up watch it Davis goes first here's ten of you coming out number six d closes off on the inside that Derrick Williams he kind of ties up give this fella some room he's going to sure pick up to New York Lionel of the leading ball carrier in this game too far with 43 yards first down Michigan 37 yard line of USC no score early in the second period idle had at last as it goes out of bounds and they're going back to the short side that time on the option done that was really well played defensively that might have had something to do with it Kurt if they did go back to the short side but you had Ron Bush defensive halfback in which way three that came up played it very well you got some good pursuit when they had those metal guys Jerry Jeter Gary jr. number 79 was out there well played and he held on the ball don't think he was picked up anything this Lydell looked like he's a junior in high school a very really dinky little frecklefaced think I didn't notice that this is my first college game those guys are really good yeah well he was getting I don't think so second down eight leach oh he can run he goes for the 30 and he's close to a first down at the USC 27 brought down by flame Matthews a linebacker leach the triple porch star in high school he's an outfielder twice and one inning he threw out runners trying to go from first to third playing right field it's not that he does have the arm he brought brought a guy with him actually from Flint Michigan that tight end number 88 gene Jensen they played together there in Flint to tight end in Fergie and Johnson they're down on a foot the goal for USC score in the game late look at that pursuit right there go forward enough to the 36 David Louis was a man that took him now this is a guy six foot four weighing 230 pounds as David Lewis 57 robbed Lionel we've told you runs a or 440 look at this big fella move way over from the other side of the field where he's playing outside linebacker widel actually around 100yard dash in nine six or seven in high school he doesn't look big he's 200 pounds though here's the measurement and they look like an inch short you got to go for it so how does the Curt I'm safe though yeah let's go these guys we're running it pretty well they're gonna go it looks like on the 26 yard line of USC fourth down an inch to go for the University of Michigan 11 and a half minutes remaining in the first half no score they're bringing the play in from the bench to the right guard here come the Wolverines they'll be digging in with a near nine man front watching Rock starts movie you got a quarterback that can run there they get a little rollout something you'll do it this time but he can retake off Lydell again we made it he made it by interest pretty hard to stop up when you get any move off that office is line and they've got some they didn't get much they're going left on do PEC 215 mark Donohue 245 here they come they made some move a little bit of impression new clock actually my babies feed back in there this could Beck's do that very well libel is known I guess it much worse blocking in history buddy good great blocker that time he tours follow the block baby this has been a rather a cautious grinding drive by Michigan from their 50 yard line for the USC 40 no score 11 minutes to play in the first half more Ripley bitches out the light in the back for the ball it was nearly a dangerous pitch shot it was correct Williams and Ron Bush played deaf and well push the right cornerback 23 coming up that one could have been intercepted yeah I don't think that was very very good basically got away with the middle there on that time Walt Underwood number 95 was the guy that was given meets trouble but he pitched a little bit late they did complete it Lyle made a good recovery to just whole load of the ball Ricky Bell is injured late tuners in early in the game hit in the head in the locker room Bell and Lydell were second and third the Tommy Dorsett in the voting for the Heisman Trophy this year Rogers have been without though running quarterback the course puts that extra pressure on the secondary Louis getting out of there he's moving out he made a good move raised his arm to pass the linemen defensive lemon hesitated just a minute he slipped between them David Lewis came back from his linebacker drop with the tackle on him you know all right here we go you see a little quick fake to Lydell rolls out the outside there's that little move the guys jump I was greener he faked a little bit bad news couldn't quite make it but Louis did third down and four from Michigan on the UFC nineteen Wolverines first scoring threat to keep vile idle by late and we kept them all down the line is for me that looks like an old faculty turn up feel is it a reverse third but lishus even come into that fall as Ron Bush the between three would you up with his half back position first down this biscuit team herd has played a hundred and sixteen without being shut out so you'd expected the scores of boys to say they're getting close today they led the nation in total offense best average per play 400 yards first man who gets the ball that giant Russell Weber football back Michigan average 39 points the game average 362 yards rushing number one in the country 440 yards eight yards total offense number one and they were number one and allowing the fewest points per game I played the game well equipped I can say they have to for that thing we're on a 10 yard line of us be second down seven mister quickness catches your eye second down Kevin he's got it out here idle we've got it the sick one push the right cornerback had to take him okay that was well played defensively Curt because it looked like they really had it open then his sermon number seven was a guy that came up actually with the finishing touches a little but that thing really looked good he had babies out front Lyle has a ball Davis knew his blocks defensive pursued by USC here's the big blue man there are Frings of play in the right guard ball now on the six yard line of the Trojan third down Rita gall for Michigan a slot right for makers Stephen cool back what a great pitch what a great cutback yeah it just burst out of there first and goal to go for Michigan all right what Idol Lila get the ball they could go up to the lake for quarterback lanlan gets it makes that cut you were talking about earlier good move give me there that was Eric with 55 Rickey old up 33 stopped in just short of the goal line first and goal to go Michigan on the USD one that the ball 11 plays on this Drive vitals Michigan around here there let you hear about it nothing fancy Davis 33 leads model saw hole and jump right through it good shot guys one thing about Lionel he'll get you a yardage outside and inside a powerful blocker good runner both ways at 200 pounds doesn't look it but he is Bob wood will try for the point he's hit 55 out of 56 they listen holes for him and a kick in right couple of you the store pictures and 6uf see nothing this new addition is at a crucial stage if the right step is taken next this owner will save money running his home and help conserve our country's natural gas supply insulation makes the difference like this pink only hold he's injured here it is look at that great time they've hanging up there that's him Walt under what we saw him go up took that big right hand up there and block the extra boy great timed his jump didn't e perfect kicking off Bob wood for Michigan and the kick me down by Cheryl Dwight 20yard line coming up next from Miami the Big Ten versus the big eight is the Ohio State Buckeyes who were here last year in the Rose Bowl are at the Orange Bowl tonight to meet the golden buffaloes of Colorado that's the 43rd Orange Bowl game Jim Simpson and John Brodie standing by to report all the action that starts right after the Rose Bowl 8 o clock Eastern Time Schembechler said yesterday says I told woody before he went out you'll enjoy buying me what is a nice resort town I'm gonna go to a Pasadena myself Rob Lydell scored the touchdown of the game Michigan's run off a 28th play from scrimmage USC 18 the to flew the fullback Charles white the tailback rookie bells in the locker room with a concussion all right getting outside at the 20 up to the 25 and he's hit by Kelvin O'Neal number 96 was really banking on John Hennessy also upsetting Tennessee did have a good shot let's look at Calvin O'Neill on his side again reading that balk going to the outside playing off Marvin Powell's block number 76 came on back in had some good help from Greg Martin that Martin is a fine one to twenty five six three can really move senior Akron Ohio second down five for the Trojan on their 25yard line wide again he was an upstanding high school player and this area last year I think one of the reasons that we can see him go to the outside Michigan's trying to close up the inside a little bit with those two those guards they're bringing in there you see him slip to the outside Charlie white does have some moves that occurred he changed directions and in there that's he now has 41 yards and just eight carries done a freshman five yards a carry in the Rose Bowl game a lot of the freshmen he's doing a good job he really is I wonder what it means the rest is flood for Rickey Bell not to be there Evans on a playaction shoots her down 50 yard line Shelton dig Rick pearl back to him will delay and panic respond to covering their short of a first down 49 and a half yard line we're going to pause briefly for station identification this is the NBC television network this is KGW TV channel 8 in portland there's a scoring drive from Michigan side 150 yards after receiving a punt calling a fair catch second down and goal for USC they're moving somewhere Greg Martin got him around the ankles at the 48 yard line of Michigan you see him over the sidelines the defensive coordinator is trying to figure out even better ways to stop us he's that time Greg Morton made a tremendous Blaker don't reaction just natural reaction follow the play was pretty well set up started to the left came back to the right Morton change directions alone with up and made the tackle he did pick up a first down though tried first down USC on to Michigan 48 going ahead in the game six nothing we have five minutes to go in the first half roll out left by ever way between the two safety men fires Franco when I look as I see so far as the coverage in college close to throw I thought that ball could have been picked off that's that I thought pickings 18 over there to position you'll see they're playing strictly as sold they hit that slot white Hicks is 17th and Pickens 18 is come in there at Blake is deep medium zones earthbound us stay under Michigan 18 fall back rumbles over the 15 and 12 and a half card line where it was tackled by Jim victims the safety man and vocally the linebacker the toufu is supposed to be a better blocker than farmer farmer the better runner put it on the 13 yard line second down 5 USC trailing 6 nothing is now mounting a scoring threat error up they come their star tailback off but freshman Charles white we've done all right for him there he has the ball right was hit by Vogel he climbed up and in fact as slow as momentum down he still I think nudged inside the 10 he did to the 9 yard line of Michigan did love a third coming a yard to go for USC girls white weighs 180 he is likened to Anthony Davis he went to the same high school as Anthony David ad used to be a zero they still be him turn him out here gone for five Mike Garrett Anthony they will go Jay Simpson Ricky Bell now this freshman Charles like don't forget very different no it was a single wing tailback a great one slash the runner Steve deceptive luckily goal to go doc well they really do they're just moving it along they picked up a little bit of the time give this white a lot of credit this is uh not a big guys you mentioned he just went inside that time kept it going hit it pretty hard alright they got two tight ends in the game gay and burn first down on the for Kurt they need to score a touchdown and they could be in trouble if they hold on this time and force them into a field goal attempt it's got to do something to the morale unless you're going to hell them earlier on the six yard line and four tracks farmers in a pull back first down play coming up tripped up at the floors he started to cut off right tackle now that's the same play that happened on the first down last time USD was beat they had the ball in the Michigan six first play no gain that makes it second down four to go or a USD touchdown six nothing Michigan 2:30 to go in the first half and USC's had this ball nine plays from scrimmage run Simpkins as the lining backer came into that goal line defense for Michigan slipped through there made the tackle out of the I formation all tied in emotion is farmer if it's just the white light is being contained guys still search forward for a yard or two you get the feeling okert us see that front lens then pushing michigan just a little bit now the snap the ball it seems that michigan's getting that jump you've got down here right close to the goal as we said twice picked up two yards of two plays in Michigan's were really firing off that ball the Grays went out of middle guard Bob Lang came in his third down two yards to go for a USC touchdown and the twominute warning though the timeout has been charged the USC timeout 140 to go in the first half it's Michigan second USC nothing we don't like to get more and pay less that's why dodge bills the lowest price pickups in America lower than Ford lower than Chevy six and v8 manual or automatic transmission dodge beats them both and you get a super tough truck both these dodge pickups have a bigger standard pay low they neither for nor Chevy and when it comes to gas mileage Dodge is real tough to mileage payload price at 39 44 Dodge is what you want to get dodge the lowest priced pickups built in America well the weather appears tough on everything are you kind of feel good that you have a darn hard you need a good battery in the city of acres in Anchorage they buy more diehards than any other battery I think the diehard was probably designed with Anchorage in mind yeah we depend on the diehard turns out more over just fantastic and so far Sears diehard battery has been a good battery for me the diehard with extra power to start your car when most batteries won't turn the key over and over and you know no sold only itse yards rushing just about even each team has run 28 plays of scrimmage Michigan leading looks nothing on a 50yard Drive they missed the extra point USC adjust call a timeout to stop the clock they have a third down and two for a touchdown our emotions white is short used to the oneyard line oh it's going to be very interesting here and another time I was coming up this has charged the USC they have one left in this half fourth down and one yard to go pretty good long yard to it's not right they're inside they've got to take it the whole yard and we're going to be back with you when they line up on the goal line score six nothing Michigan it's hard to go for touchdown on fourth down Oh wanna fight by Charlie white these guys over the line he went through with a plate perfectly heaven wellplayed you've gotta be there k96 coming around that gun fake hit him in the middle this guy's got the speed the uh Trent L ramp over to the sidewalk I think Charlie wife's taking dramatics at USC that's right what a fake that was an acting job by Charles life there's Evans rolling out the quarterback for the score another angle for you little wife there's Evan I hear the kick now was an 80yard Drive by us they have the lead the minute 28 to go all of our tailback powerful Rickey Bell who runs over people at u18 garli why carry the ball seven times in my free time and they took it in coming up next from Miami it's the Big Ten versus the big eight as the Ohio State Buckeyes beat Colorado so stay tuned for the Orange Bowl 80 play in ER 12 plays extra point Walker's four by Evan that's the story of the USC Drive Ricky Bell being out Kurt is not unlike Michael Harris Rocky Bleier not playing last week against Oakland but you see USC they just put another guy in there to do what Ricky Bell supposed to be doing and he's doing a pretty good job up he is we have a minute 28 to go in the half Rob Kerr will kick off Jim Smith Lawrence Reed or deep along with rot Lydell and the kick is coming to 3:20 up to the 30 down in a 31yard line and he brought down there by number 54 Southern Cal at Goethe res so let's see what Michigan because now they have a minute 23 left in this first half will raise ball on her own 31 to powerhouse teams going at each other on the ground very little throwing in the game although one toss from Evans to dig set up the USC touchdown Evan through 10th of 7 completed 5 for 62 yards there in a slot left formation leach and a straight drop back this time the screen where Katrina's no good that's too hard we look too hard at the short range and he's trying to hit Davis the fullback Jeter was in there rushing the quarterback leak watch Jeter on this chart what's his initial move this is Jeter Gary Jeter comes to the outside really just an overpowering these guys the offensive line they don't they ready no pass block that much so therefore their technique is not nearly as good as it is against the run so you don't really expect great protection from these guys in the straight drop back sort of situation his Uncle Bob Jeter played out here in the Rose Bowl and 59 for Iowa and still holds the alltime Rose Bowl record for most ground game guard gained in the game we had an average unbelievable act Leif's is possible here getting out of bounds Dean Johnson the tight end from Flint Flint there they are Dean Johnson sophomore twenty six foot four runs the four seven forty goodness alive where these guys keep coming from that ball was right on target he's got a great arm that's leach he throws it hard baseball player and has someone like a baseball delivery Curt more than a lead like drills it follows through that wrist great wrist action he throws right now he has his team on the 43 of Michigan with the first down one minute 14 to go and a half USC leading 7 of tricks he drills out intercepted by clinched closure the rover back number 49 he didn't expect that ball a shot right by him he only had really one receiver in that pattern and that was Smith coming across there's a lot of USC jerseys back there what we got we have a flag down that's an ineligible man downfield all right headache happy new years they were all in bed early last night sure we all were we happy new years back to Bucks County Franklin County all those neat places wherever they are 15yard penalty you were explaining to me Curt that there are no automatic first downs and holding in college football that we have a few changes look at this and that's pretty hey that is pretty haha that's at the Rose Bowl that's where we are by some strange coincidence first down on the Michigan 27 getting straight ahead Russell Davis to fall back as you can see now with that penalty to change his style instead of going for broke this may be stay on the ground back at her own territory thank you right the minutes ago I think you're right of course USC might want to call timeout right now they've got him pretty well back that's not really that bad but we got another second half coming there's 46 seconds to go in the first half second down to bunch second down on the 32 second and 21 for Michigan 76 USC lady look at Jeter whoops he pushed it out there it is going to Stevenson no good Stevenson covered by Dennis Thurmond the safety man who has an eye and a nose for the ball he's all over the field Jeter again going after left did they push Jeter by him you'll see this but Jeter's number 79 that's what's the hip city that leach actually gets from rich dimmler tell us not Deming out there here's number 92 he called him right on the seven didn't he he wrote in third down twenty one to go for Michigan time remaining twentynine seconds in the first half Michigan trailing by a point Davis turning up fields shorter the 40 of Michigan USC has one timeout left and they've just called it they have stopped the clock 21 seconds to go in the first half would imagine they just try to put a lot of fresh roll on the kicker would you Kurt like rush everybody or do you think that's gonna stop the return we've got good return guys you don't know they call timeout they're gonna try to take advantage of this time I would say they put some pressure on we'll watch there's leech the quarterback as Bo Schembechler and the dark or the blue blazer chomping on that gum furiously we told you had a heart attack out here and he had a heart bypass operation last made a vigorous courageous man who gave his doctor his surgeon a pep talk before surgery are you emotionally and physically ready to go on his operation and he said yes I have I did six of these yesterday night down to the wire right down to the wire well in 89 games under old Bo his team is scored in double figures so he has had something he gets them fired up some way doesn't he has an amazing record he lost only ten games in eight years of Michigan all right the puck hit the low one it is nobody back there they were going after him and this one will be dead on the USD six yard line where the Trojans will take over was just 11 seconds to go and they're not going to be messing around down there deep in their own territory a 54yard punt by John Anderson first down USC Michigan scored first a 50yard dr.rob Lydell took it in a yard out 7 minutes 8 seconds to play and a half USC after a touch back on the kickoff came back to go 80 yards Vince Evans rolling out to his left the yard after a clever fake and an acting job by tailback Charlie White diving over the middle of the line Evan just scooted around untouched for the score there kick was good in a 706 USC kevin falls on it block moving away now they're down at the right ends of the field both them ago to their locker room at the end of the first half the 63rd Rose Bowl game in Pasadena California the score is USC 7 and Michigan 6 unbelievable this Aspen sedan as a look that's very European so much comfort is a pleasure to be here we'll have halftime activities in just a moment right now we pause for these messages from your local station a big double feature mystery movie first Mac escapes death but he's not safe someone tried to kill him and he'll try again Rock Hudson is Macmillan then a fortune and diamonds and attempted murder spell danger for the chief medical examiner Jack Klugman is Quincy McMillan then Quincy three hours of action Sunday starting at 8:00 7:00 central time like a half of the Rose Bowls underway oh the wife the white is coming to chamber soon we are to the 10th and it will be position for USC very meter on the tackle first down USC on their 15yard line why still a tailback Rickey Bell was hit in the back of the head I think he probably had a slight concussion that's precautionary they don't bring him back in a second in for observation Dave farmers the fullback Charles white the freshman the tailback and then seven playing an excellent quarterback today spins and gives it off to the fullback farmers farmers to his 18 yard line a three yard gain second down seven Vince Evans last year couldn't have thrown the ball up on the stand at the Rose Bowl they say hit only 38 percent of his passes and one project that John Robinson had was to improve Evans and the USC passing game and he's done that Evans has hit over 50% this year and has done it the Rose Bowl game second down 7 for USC from their 18 now they're into a double wing set up Evans will throw for the sideline to go Sheldon dig on his 24 and up there on him with Pickens and also Dwight Hicks the safety man all right take a look here that's Hickman has Hennessy look at Hennessy making a move on the other side Donny Hickman number 60 was the goddess block ability man he's really been doing a good job all day keeping these guys out his dad was a lumberjack in Arizona he thought was that helped him cut trees he's doing a little cutting down today he is for a fact third down and two Gerald's wide outside he goes it made it a first down for the freshman we quite a story in USA football history if he continues to run away is here today Kurt take a look got good blocking on the other side of you got Marvin Powell tackling this move right here that he puts on Jim Boulden came in there they call it the lift leg see it then you don't throw it out there like a shot that didn't take it back use that move particularly well as these ball first down under 36 their head 7 to 6 early in the third period Evans and that's weren't rollout gets it down the middle yeah lady grill that one to Mike Robinson Mike Robinson a senior from Richmond California of Randy simran do not have a bad P Robinson will not be in the lineup not only six passes all year but how this Evans is on target today that one was really well throw Kurt I thought he actually was gonna try a sideline over here again to the right he had him open throwing the digs but he came back into the middle drilled it right between those linebackers and found an opening miss Evans six out of eight for Vince Evans they go back in the eye after the motion Evans pitched the white white cuts it in for 45 and down to the 42 of Michigan brought down by Jerry meter weak side linebacker and wide hips the safety man and let's check freshman Charles light now he's moving along and ground gaining he's up in the 70s that's the kind of a reverse you see it runners stop pick up the guy just tackled him that means he must be on top of the game second down for USC is moved from their 15yard line after the second half kickoff white got away from over he's on it his stay there I say that there was a Greg Morton and white Hicks ready to pounce on it that jarred loose that Dwight Hicks is really big coming up from that safety really making some moves this is a heck of a break for USC because he did just knock him loose and that ball just seemed to stick right on the turf has that blessed if that's the verse 17 in your program number one in your heart Dwight Hicks as he just popped him and it fell right there any felony Hicks has eight tackles so far for solos and four assists third down and five look at that chair by Tom Seagram the defensive end nearly got him it was secret hanging on to him there he is Kurt you see he's got that one leg he grabs the right leg heaven somehow maintains his palace look at that and then throws about Vince nice job fella the two food products we're going for it on the 39 in Michigan fourth down and a short yard to go we'll pull back then both sided go do it folks we come in here on their feet down below us to see how their team can hold long single cow you got email they nearly had him now they're trying to pull outside let's get them on I wish they'd quit tricking me that way when I see them line up on that fourth downs I think I do I like this they're going to go they're going to go they got them trick plays and it's gonna for the other folks offsides what a coordination by the Michigan pine puffing on the yes Hillary feeling to jump off but how about the composure of that USC offensive line these guys jump it up in front of your face now they're all move it for some reason look at that right in the middle they're trying to get it going graves in there so it will be a penalty puts them back in a little bit more of a punting position fourth and six the punter is Glenn Walker who hangs him high we have light Hicks and Jim Smith punt returners the near corner fair catch call by Smith on his 16 yard line he's been contained today he hasn't had much of a chance of catching any passes or running back kicks at the one reverse he picked up about seven over that's all time out with a score USC seven and Michigan six Singh up by the 16th Ricky Bell will not play the rest of the game I think he's come out in spree close I would imagine he might have a life concussion or a head injury look at that move from the back Oh diving and the thing has it rod Martin I think it was Kurt that came he was on my head linebacker all right you'll see Lietz go down the line but he doesn't see from his backside rod Martin number 52 and he has played a great game today he's really been everywhere it causes the fumble you'll see a kick back out there Underwood had a shot at it didn't make it in time Bill diffic number 73 the tackle alertly went back to recover and Eric Williams the linebackers on the ground right now so Rickey Bell injured very early in the game fact looking at his figures he carried the ball only four times and then was hit in the back of the head or the neck and was taken out and will not be back in and neither will Zuber the wolf fan for Michigan he was injured in the first down here's our telecom term while we have time here I want to say that all of us here in the NBC booth and in the sports department covering this game want to send along our condolences to the family of Phil Islan the owner of the New York Jets absolutely I had the general yesterday and from what I understand Carl Linum in fact called me the directors forth of NBC and said that Howard Cosell gave one of the most moving eulogies that he's ever heard and compliment howard for his words and not many people better with words than he is he was friend of business it was a very close friend and say at a beautiful eulogy there's the toss the Jim Smith Smith was covered there by Ricky Odom the cornerback may not mean much but you saw elites come out he threw the ball when he's running to his left lead left and it passed that's supposed to be the easiest way to throw it he had that Bo way back up I had himself and he drilled that thing really zipped it out there he had to get himself in total position to do it a lot of quarterbacks come out and they develop conflict toss with their wrists but they don't have to use their entire body or that followthrough motion that time he tried to use all of it wait a little bit long to receiver wound up outside they have a third and 18 done right now they're in bad shape here in the third quarter 9:50 to go leach as they pitch it with david lewis the linebacker jumping on it maybe it's burning away from him it may have I don't know who the Michigan player is but that fall that play that play was totally contained by USC defense you can't get them apart and up for the ball they do have it USA now watch it possibly turn over model they have been hurt on that play let's look at it again as libel as the ball was pitched through the pitch really didn't have any shot at going at all you see David Lewis 57 that came in there then leach key back to trying to get it away from him and I believe that he lost that battle with David Lewis must give Lewis the fumble recovery first down for USC or what the 8 8 yard line had a second Michigan turnover and a biggie USC has not made a mistake they have not turned the ball over there leading 706 first and goal to go white and farmer behind been seven heavens to white bubble again again we I think the cover or Greg Martin either one of the tackles down they have his office if he can pick it up never got control of it it is me zips up in the middle I don't know who got it and I'm not going to try to say if somebody got it up in Tedesco and have all popped up in the air let's see we'll take another look at it alright it's white you see the ball he never had Charlie White never had possession of it we tried to grab it from his knee knocked it off let's see it again let's give it to mr. Mort all right give it a morning first Don Michigan Honda 9 and they come out to the 11 it was a good shot again in there I'd say this rich dimmler has been playing some good football today he's not even a regular starter he's been coming in playing an awful lot number 92 for USC again he was in there on that one for about a yard game 8 yard line us he had the 1st and goal lost it I'm Michigan back again John Robinson and his quarterback from seven rival clipped up two yards in the last Jerry at 61 yards in the game and Michigan's been in the hole here in the third period late draft if the way comes back to the 10s Lauren his head and went to the 16th all he could do Italian and that's really just instinctive running he was boxed in over there that's obviously was not a design play hope he's not flipping we've got to have a guy down over there on the outside looks like that is stimbler we're just talking about Ron dimmler let's see if we can see what happened to him playing that nose guard firing right off into Walt downing that outstanding sinner that we've been talking about there's his plane as Steve we could figure I got hurt I got hitting the left rip must have wow mark Donahue well he's up and moving off so alright yeah hope so replacing with Harold steel lease did a good job Curt picking up what he picked up yeah they had it really pretty well conceding that backfield made some good moves instinctive a little bit to get back up for where he did remember they wrote the Rose Bowl here will be followed by the Orange Bowl Ohio State in Colorado they're standing by Miami John Brodie is mr. Simpson right they're going to be the third Orange Bowl Classic we're down and free 15yard line in Michigan please keep the ball to the 19 I don't know whether he has the first down or not he tried to stretch out there forth wildly untangle we pause briefly for station identification this is the NBC television network KGW TV channel 8 Portland Kurt Goudy and I'm Meredith here again in Pasadena they're going to measure us see took the opening kickoff of the second half on the 15yard line they went to the Michigan 44 they punted Michigan had the ball fumbled away on her 8 yard line USC recovered fumble on the next play Michigan took over in their 9 and now the first down measurement is short and Michigan will be going into a punt formation John Anderson to do the kicking Dennis Thurman the junior from Santa Monica California is a safety man for USC these are two high scoring teams both going over 30 points a game this year yeah we have a low scoring Rose Bowl 7 to 6 good athletes Curt yes good athletes they've got him on both teams play good defense good football Anderson waiting for that snap lowdriving kick Thurmond back feels good on his 36 good coverage and he found on his 36 yard line and they're covering Michigan had three men down and will be back in a minute here in the Rose Bowl with a score USD 7 and Michigan 6 Kenney Randall's into the wide receiver number 28 along with Shelton Diggs Vince Evans big story today for USC completing 8 out of 10 passes rating high we chose a deep deep deep he's covered and out of there was number 26 dick and he was smothered by Jim Pickens and it was a big rush by Jerry meter the weakside linebacker who was blitzing they had it pretty well figured out I think he did a good job Rudy's to get that ball off he threw it way away quite a story on this man yes sir Gary boy has not conceived and has been undergoing Mike Carey undergoing chemotherapy at his spleen removed and it's a great human interest story here's the other fellas up farmer Dave farmer straight ahead I think USC felt they could run inside their tackles better than they've been able to today Kurt and talking to the coaches and look at their coaching staff they really felt they could of course they were counting on using a Rickey Bell up the middle who's more of that power kind of runner but they've gone to another kind of offense today with his absence we noticed leach and Jim Smith and the offensive coach there they've got to cook something up nice you're gonna break a play here they're being very well contained by USC in the second half third down and seven for the Trojans from their 39 using that rollout again he's wide open area Robinson beautiful crossing pattern the play to the right to pass back to the left dirt that there he was that was super now what he did what Robinson did he took off like he's going to the inside you'll see this play start to the right you're right it's a move to the right side of that offensive line Robinson in turn comes in runs across the middle it comes back out to the outside and he was really wide open area setting up heavens got it ball right there flip that looked like he's throwing about five yards did it just a little flip vital natural athletes make me sick first down Charles White pounds inside the 35 to the 31 white and you know it's fumble a couple of times lost one of them the other one he didn't but he has a penchant for fumbling a little concerned about that can you teach a man not the fumble oh I don't know I just gave him some ball he can run as well as he's been running today I didn't fumble a few times yeah have some fumble recovery drills during the week second down 5 USC leading 706 618 to go in the third period there is a hit the speed graves couldn't catch it who was it that was Steve gray oh man or was it or was up the two food was hit there at good event Bob poor panic they came out there I think that was the Wolfman pop act number 15 24 graves is 54 but he did that the wolf man I guess Curt is like that Rover he's supposed to go he they really want they go yeah he's supposed to diagnose those plays and go where he is the rest of the guys boy West play an area our position trying to free up the wolf man they call it that term he was their third and four for USC from the Michigan 30 heaven fast and please don't think they've got the first down now it's the toufu who came out of the backfield and he didn't look at that marker on the far side it should have been a yard or two deeper you're right back right they've been gambling on his fourth downplays then seven says don't measurement warp and one is on the 27 yard line in Michigan USC in possession and they've used up most of the time here in the third period they've had the ball up they come now fourth down one no less they shift into it where if they'll go off tackle seems like they do right rambling wide on a quick hitter has the first down at the Michigan 25 and he's hit there Gerry leader well this is the kind of play where everybody's got to do it right and look at them far out here they come as Donny Hickman number 61 and he's right off a ton his rear end there's he just tries to make that first end he got just enough Charlie White the freshman has 78 yards and 20 carries nearly four yards a shot Evans with a rollout pattern again Tedesco down danesco Riverside Illinois number 99 what's the ball back in a 35 yard line that's a 10 yard loss for USC second down 20 Tom Tedesco brings us some great credentials into this ball game we haven't heard that much I live today but you saw that time another tremendous athlete six for about 250 220 Riverside Illinois great pro prospect untold only a junior at Michigan the official attendance 106,000 182 second down 20 USC in the lead 76 controlling the clock on the ball in the third period that becomes 35 then move to the 30 over the 30 to the 28 with power Greg Mart wrapped him up from behind helped by Dom Tedesco you see a quarterback move like that you I hope there's to believe that it's almost like a call quarterback draw I don't really think he was that serious about throwing or if he was he had some hesitation with his man when they called that play because he really went back maybe he did take a quick look get it be bit he decided that's not where it was game back up front it find his way in the middle picked up about what seven right Michigan defending USC had the ball under 36 after a punt they have now marched at the Michigan 28 and they've had the ball nine plays under stride third down and three Paul still get to the way that's the tight end bill gay was known more for his blocking and his fascinating well Evan slips down a little bit this time he's trying to come back with like a half roll to get over to the right side they set their blocks up on the right side you see that he slips a little bit comes back up throws late got a got a pretty good lick in there that time about the desk go again he says hey I'm so sorry why not throw it a little bit earlier body English in the prone position field goal attempt now from the 35 45 yard kick is off to the left when Walker missed the field goal he'll he'll have a first go in a timeout USD seven Michigan protection hey let's see how some owners of America's oil companies live these Texaco stockholders fuss over two million other Americans invest in America's oil industry and six cut is alone over half for women almost half are retired 12 million more invest through organizations like

two pages a second a report for every 50 and they Binkley for every report good morning boys good you need one more copy hi just shy I saw a shot of Bob Hope there he's going to have an allstar comedy spectacular on NBC January 21st and Margaret Mac Davis Olivia newtonjohn and Sammy Davis jr. play back yet 5yard gain Michigan is that terrible field position in this third period this is their third possession they started at the 9 yard line the 16 yard line the 20 yard line they have not been in USD territory in this half and now they're changing your backfield they're going to put litelift pull back and a speedster sophomore Harlan Huckabee who runs 195 at tailback number 25 second and five for Michigan look at this out Lake go to 30 35 or 36 Flint Michigan and a safety man Dennis Thurmond brought him down all right let's take another look you see fake to the laddle up the middle key back to the outside he's got underwood going outside this is what I think those bachelors clinics really counting on his Porter back to new he's a young quarterback great running guy adds another back in that backfield that time he picked up his first down ladies cuts wisely Jim Smith flanks to the right we haven't seen much of him handling the ball in the game plays this period Southern Cal 18 Michigan only eight running on a first down play from scrimmage well idle no wait is nowhere to go no sir dive tackle play Lionel maybe had a yard on it Mario's salata number 59 John Robinson Charlie's widely white he freshman tailback big job today filling in for Ricky Bell who ran the ball only four times and had to leave the field and his now in street clothes and has wrapped up his USC career on a sad note for him yeah he's really a competitor really want to play this ball game we were talking to him day before yesterday he said I want to be in the Rose Bowl second down eight leach future down the sideline to Stephenson Davidson a Californian I think Oya California walk in on the mission without a bond they say it was knocked out by Thurman and his turban from Santa Monica's the guy that knocked this man loose he was wide open over there and look at Thurman number seven glance that shoulder and just pops it loose didn't hold on to it Kirk that would have been in a second catch of the season you got to be kidding really it's right they don't and he's a split in Jim Smith is caught 24 for a 28 yard average per catch think they're mortars didn't win it and they are having fun they don't throw anymore they're shadowing Smith today he's flanked to the near side now third down and eight from Michigan Leake the gun the spent a guy finally got at the gym strip see how much fun that is what play like that you call that kind of playing a hoe you say I'm gonna get back here and think about five steps on the rides and we'll take four steps my laughs you can't hold him off as low as you can I'm gonna duck Jeter's he comes in slide off the other side I'm will get rid of Underwood I'm gonna throw it out to you spit on the outside and do with it what you can and there it is there is i watch Smith but he was doing he's now he sees that the scrambled on he has a ball 28 yards a catch this year six touchdown will be at number one draft choice a wide receiver in the pros with his outlet look out moving there they had a false start on Michigan it was Mike Ken legal procedure Mike in for a few penalties in the game that'll put the ball back on the UFC 47 this is the first time that we've had Michigan and USD territory in this half sir Leslie ahead 76 we're in the last minute of play of the third period right Michigan breaks out again they're fans is paddle here banana Harbor points East does not have a lot to cheer about in the second half so rather quiet oh he's got him open looking oh yeah fell over his old man and how the front was Mark Donohue and advertently got in his way well you know it's like if you do best what you do most often sometimes said but I that time Kurt again you got a lefthanded quarterback rolling to his right I think he had run on his mind more than fast because if he was very trying to work and read a defensive secondary and see where his receivers are he had a couple of guys one got it was wide open and another guy that was moving in that direction I think he had really able to run and he picked up two yards Benny Van Dyke is in it right tackle with glassing wall under was the USC second down Harlem hustle days near first down at the Michigan USC 32 where he was nailed by David Lewis of rookie Oda and David Lewis caring for the speedster luckily and that's the end of the third quarter here in the 1977 Rose Bowl game with a score USC 7 and Michigan Tech the American Eagle Goodyear's symbol for its allamerican kind of radial tire Goodyear is committed to product innovation we introduced rayon cord and tires we created the poly glass tire on the poly steel radio and now the American Eagle will belts a flexed

add I'm Meredith as we move you into the fourth period tight affected gave us see leading 76 and earlier today Pittsburgh very impressively blue Georgia 27 to three Tony Dorsett a 200 yard game and Houston appendant Maryland giving them their first defeat of the season 32 21 this is a third down and 1 play as we open the fourth quarter for Michigan third and one yeah an off time the handoff I think you're right battle he usually gets to the line of scrimmage and more but that's where he doesn't have a chance so you had Jeter you had Williams Matthews rod Martin those linebackers Harrell steel held up the middle pretty well they had up in a good situation they never really got that play off and I think you're right it was not really that slick coming out of the backfield I didn't had it going they lost the yard they have a fourth down into the trailing by a point Zehra bring to play in from the Michigan bench uncle bays the tailback I'd roll out a second good right there room pull back everybody up at her feet now he is rolling out side of the pack this will sit down Phil I think is going to throw later brought him down we've got a goddess Heiser down the field off I'm afraid that David Lewis and he has really played a super ball game that was Lewis and Jeter that made that move on leech again that was a situation where you had to lift it a quarterback roll it right and you've got something you won't tell me Kurt what is it I want to tell you at the time out here with a ride USC seven and Michigan this home and 40 million others all over the country have something in common they all depend on natural gas for heat as half the homes in America depending on gas America is cooking with gas to over 30 million families depend on natural gas to cook their meals so the most restaurants as a lot of hungry people depending on gas America's industry needs gas natural gas provides by far the largest share of energy for industry that means much of our economy depends on gas millions of workers depend on natural gas for their jobs for supporting their families actually in one way or another we all depend on gas getting more gas can't wait any longer on once an eagle

of bounds at the 44 events the 7 yard gain third down to I don't know there's a long way to go in this game yet 1328 I don't know who'll be the most valuable player but I'll tell you right now I think the leader might be Vince Evans the USC quarterback basketball doubleheader tomorrow grandstand will be on air 1 o'clock Eastern Time then we have Michigan it's a quick football team and they got a very quick basketball the Ricker green bill Hubbard against South Carolina and a 4 o'clock UCLA lose with only one game this year against Houston here in LA Lane's basketball doubleheader on NBC

got it oh that's funny Jim holding number 22 who's the guy they're defending first down for USC on to Michigan 45 yard line six receptions for Sheldon Diggs in this game Evans hands it off white breaks through and comes to the 42 yard line in Michigan brought down by Bob Patek was playing the Wolfman in place of the injured Jerry zuver threeyard gain second and seven Evans on passing has been outstanding pence Evans who could complete only 37 percent of his passes last year in the Rose Bowl game today is completed 11 out of 15 for 128 yard and he scored the only USD touchdown on a oneyard rollout second down 7 7 is 6 USC ahead of Michigan early in the fourth period again for the past wide open right there that gets older Diggs is uneasy dig said hey throw me a bat yeah told me one low

Michigan 42 behan big desert first down vii petrol jigs in a game he's the fella in 75 to cut the twopoint play dat beat Ohio State as Pat Haden through the gym to Don McKay son for the touchdown one point behind instead of going for the tie they went for the twopoint and Dick's got a low pass unlocked down USC I'd like to see him come back to him run after he dropped one even though when he caught that one they've been a combination today Evans and Diggs it's the Charles White nowhere to go for a while that's John Anderson in their number 86 there's Ricky Bell looking on carried the ball four times early in the first period got to be injured probably a head injury and was not allowed to come back on the field again for his own protection here's a fellow that gained 18 hundred yards last year junior to lead the nation 1,400 this year hobbled by injury the end of the season bowed out of USC one of the finest running backs of all time I imagine we'll see him play again don't you Kurt oh yeah he'll be in some city in America next year that's right baby Tampa Bay Dick's in various tackle by hitch that came up from the Facebook bus Michigan is getting desperate now they want the ball they need it they're only a point behind but they haven't been able to break open or make the big play against USC today see if we could see where Hicks come from is a safety there but they're in college ball these safeties they really have got to be great tackle is good athletes he saw him roaming around up in there got a little help from Calvin O'Neill the linebacker but mainly was Hicks who came into this safety position to put that pressure freshman Charles White has a net of 84 yards this is third down and 15 for USC got him again there he is dick the Dix is doing it you're really giving it a lot of room over there Kirk fancy evich rose a little bit to his left you see we're gonna jump pickets if niggas give him a lot of food plus he slept down a little bit but that time to

tofu policy most ate mostly will see two food you know Kurt with Ricky Bell not playing they he had a chance to break the alltime pack eight rushing record I believe in fifty some young at these other yards and course you know you see it guys had a great career like I told him yesterday I said five games he broke your friend record but he really was after a really big one there he's not going to make it go down six southern cow on Michigan seventeen ten minutes to go USC ahead by one point seven to six met at the 15 Charles White was slammed there John Enders is right in the middle of it Kurt Gerron meter number 46 yard gain third down for Southern Cal Michigan went to the USC 33 they had a third and one and couldn't get a first down out of it at USC is taking the ball from their 36th and marched right down to the Michigan 15 mostly on castles and been seven do a wide receiver Sheldon Diggs just seen out of 18 he still don't have digs covered over the top of your screen aisle four I looked for him check out the day seven right it's that little pressure from the inside you'll see a little move and then the inside by Grieg 477 he's the guy that chasing him gun great speed Martinez

Wolverines ball under 24 they're trailing seven to six eight and a half minutes to play vital the fullback Huff will be the tail back behind quarterback Rick leak emotion is Jim Smith H the Huckabee of the me Wallander was the right tackle got him number 95 and he blocked the extra point as right now is the difference in this game Michigan scored first Underwood block for point good reaction by a

only 181 yards they're under 200 for the game Southern Cal has 360 yards they have doubled the total output of Michigan well these guys have had they've really gotten into dog fighting they really

off balance Jeremy picton sort of hit him around the ankles on the way I think this is the time of the game Kurt when you see we acknowledge going into both coaches acknowledge that the size or weight difference between the two balls left was in paper of USC this is now the fourth quarter we're really winding down five minutes a little bit more to go you see that big offensive line come off and they just pushed them back a little bit more they did early in the game second down five for USC on the Michigan forty two white flags down Mike those two the 37 338 a balance off flag dropped I did yeah I think if this play is my fallback I get Charlie White a hundredyard 103 yards for Charles white there's the flag looks like it's going to yellow roll I think it's going to be holding against us you see that's a biggie 15 yards right Kirk right all right now they're back second the whole bunch you might see Biggs come back into it again he's the guy that's been open they really have been getting a great deal of room I don't think he really came in as a speedster but for some reason the defensive coverage of Michigan is allowed Biggs to roll fairly free and that at least that middle zone or the short zone he's been open holding USC well they'll have a second down and 20 coming up next from Miami Ohio State against Colorado in the 43rd Orange Bowl they tuned NBC right after this road Bowl or the Orange Bowl Lanny better downplay the score is 76 USC as if he very little today faster but the guy you got a really good refresh look at this food it goes back sets up gets a big rush by number 54 Steve grades in the middle steps the other side and we get in there right over that linebacker defense in fact Kelly got him to tackle now there's a hero on at USC benches name is Matt been mentioned it will tell you about in a minute first down USC on their Michigan 30 that's white rightist to the 26 of Michigan there's a man over there they Paul packet he's an assistant coach and he was hired especially to come down here and coach Vince Evans into being a better passer he coached dick Bartowski numberone draft pick we went with Atlanta and he coached Jill Roth last year the junior and attack right there and he came down her and did the yellow shirt has done quite a job Vince Evans has put on a fantastic passing show today in this Rose Bowl there on the 27 yard line 101 yards he saw hacking of a sideline giving some sort of gyrations for what that really hungry signal they are signals and they stand in which I thought was kind of interesting Kirk not deflate the vents of it they send in a choice they sit in two plates and they say you make up your mind which one you walk so George is of course coordinating with the press box and so was goes that he seemed talking to the head coach but they did send the plate they sent two plays in every time they may have an offensive formation so habits fixed from one of those two and they say if he doesn't like it he still has the pinky he can cheat he can call something else but making them do suggestions take a pic this is a legal procedure Pedley against other chow I'd like to get a count on the number of plays in the second half it's been the USC honest in favor of USA they have just controlled the ball the whole half label procedure on both clock steady of all winds up on the 27 yard line of Michigan there's that signal a second down and seven after the play Johnny Robinson with a yellow pass the red sweater his first year ghosting with the Oakland Raiders last year said he learned more about the passing game there in any place he's ever been and his great friend John Madden is working on rooting for the Danno I thought this is going to be a pitchout you see that M is never a first fin any of the balls is a truth booth follow some good blocks a good spin right there they had capital deal pretty well taken care of that time brought it down first down on the seven USC has clearly dominated the second half without gain Michigan total offense two to one first and goal ago getting dark here in Pasadena Gerald white the question super lucky bail first from the plane that he makes quick pitch at the outside look at offensive line pulling let's move out they took care the moonshine oh yeah he has the booze they take care of hit us in the middle what's this lose right here right into the middle he'll be the next great tailback in USD he's already established that today Bob paddock the wolf in had a shot at him right before the goal line he gave you a little move and slid right on in 13 to 6 a big point here for a walker now and the kick is up to kick in that's the way doing c14 and Michigan Michigan is a powerful ball control team it just hasn't had the ball much in the second half dick is coming to Smith at the 7th mess with the 20 breakthrough enough for the 39 of the 33 yard line first down Michigan now desperate 33 that last drive 58 yards eight plays wife went seven yards for the score short of the alltime Rose Bowl record now Rick leech has to go to work the back to Davis at fullback rival at tailback there's an open plays on a month all right he's bumped right there to live by Ron Bush run comes back he got number 33 Rickey Olaf chasing it trying to make an interception off the side Smith held his concentration kept the ball in the middle 32 yard pass play Michigan knocking again now if they do sleek era specimens storming back not known as a passing demon they're having to play catchup with a passing game first down on the USD 24 complete the gym this really cool ready run out of bounds there was a lot of pressure put on Rick leach that time clay matthews came here from the backside linebacker out there the linebackers we talked about Louis Martin Matthews they're all doing it Lewis that ten tackles Martin 11 Matthews at eight here's the lease again the lefthanded quarterback you see just his body right behind he was Matthew's threw it way I take hurt these guys the USC secondary is not really set up to curve the slot formation they're giving the outside receiver a lot of room you can throw out pattern sideline pattern for 18 yards anytime you want you second down ten from Michigan on the USC 24 USC ahead 14 aspect Riedel keeps the ball that's least the elite which keeps him go from the 13 Williams and Thurmond pinched him there time moving against Michigan they had a full complement of timeouts left they did have they now have two left just to play they need a touchdown and they need a twopointer for time that is something one of those slips antes Brenes at the tall that was slipped off the hand that one even close 2:09 they don't have a few minutes morning thing here at college ball we are today I'm sorry I didn't know that I thought they had a twominute drill they also don't have any of your sudden victories either Kurt play the game for Michigan fourth and four yes the 18 yard line why it was just mother down here by two men who was intended for robbed Lydell but no Jan I could have gotten in the Canadian kind a couple drops and a double dropped on him first down give it off the white bike running away to the 23yard line the freshman is a leading ball carrier of the game he's carried the ball 32 times Oh hope he's not hurt hello da fella 112 yards they going to take he's upset I think something on the clock how they start the line to town I think he's upset with the scoreboard which is 14 6 behind him the Rose Bowls not been kind for him he lost the Stamper 13 as well 14 to 3 didn't coach look at that buffet but he had the heart attack had a fantastic comeback as a man that you will consider but openheart surgery last May I'm moving on 119 to stop 25 I want to thank Joe Costanza very much a dr. Robert Woods always a good team physician for they're very valuable assistants here in our booth they'll both be baguette",

  "transcript": "last year and was never really the saying the rest of the year but this year he's come back he's caught the ball in traffic and taken a lot of hits and he takes one here for the good catch first I'll Texas the Longhorns get out of the shadow of their goalpost there now for the 43 yard line Kristen 10 Jackson Jones up the top of the screen out of the picture now and off the Earl Campbell Steve Earl Campbell is a very deceptive runner you don't think that he's very very fast looks like there's been a London long but he really wore Johnny lambda Dave Hall Johnny Lam Jones the receivers for Texas first out Texas at the Oklahoma 45 was the horns have something going enter Gibson himself and it wrapped up as against the 43 yard line by line backer George coming of course was a fullback last year jury has just excellent speech they changed him over during spring training last year from fullback they had a lot of full backs and then moved him over the linebacker and Barry Switzer was really high on this young man and of course this is the story of the defensive team in Oklahoma you had Barry Birgit who was a running back and then is now and now is now a defensive end you've got there always a quarterback and is now in the defensive backfield 153 left Chris that's a factor great three all tied here Texas second down eight at the Oklahoma 43 yard line the kitchen wants to go again looks for Jackson teachers are showing bathroom under pressure of course Alfred as excellent hands an excellent space will be a program pick this year Texas using the toy the Oklahoma 25yard line they have a stop on this rope the young man saw I'm coming McEachern went ahead and threw the ball for the completion and of course first down for Texas as they drive down 25 yards away from a touchdown in a minute 41 seconds to go here comes Friday McEachern is come off the bench the third Texas quarterback little horns on this Drive they have a slot to split the bottom of the screen and off those two goes instead got a ham Joe takes it inside the oklahoma 25 line number 25 Johnny ham Jones Alba carry Gary burger 26 on the tackle Johnny lamb Jones comes back in the Texas huddle at flanker evidently Michael Wacha and Johnny Lambo bringing in plays for Randy imagine they play pretty basic right now passing stats 41 protection it is indeed a new look Texas teen here's Earl Campbell that's his name walk for the big man and as for the first man for Texas you'll see perfect balance of speed power and balance he just never never loses his balance that deceptive speed with Steve Hawking Oklahoman on the Texas floor throwing a key block Erick's David Amanda attempt the extra point he's 21 of 24 so far this season on straight firstly on the Texas side noscope fans are here there are some of those wild Longhorn fan Steve you know this has to be a big boost for Randy McEachern also for the entire and he can guide the team 80 yards six plays so obviously they'll have second hand five seconds Homa on the far side Ava demonstrate on the inside of muscleups later as a teen dumping the 40 right in the middle of the deal Ino Brendon they get a run back over straight no Thompson goes out of the end zone would be a touchback in Oklahoma will take over first in ten and it sold for the yard line 80 yards away but the Texans goal 105 play in the first half Texas music 10 degrees Chris forgery I was wondering them do you think Oklahoma will play conservative now when they try to get into any kind of field goal range apart amount of football I don't think there's any doubt about the fact that they will get rid of a conservative football I've been playing in the first half I think Oklahoma knows that right now we've got a minute for five seconds so they can eat up most of that clock and they're going to have to go into the bracing parameter seven points down or they're going to go in time and I think they're going to play some aggressive football and Tommy lot support around brought back in at quarterback intervention and off the Kenny King right up the middle push back baby gained over play Texas Steve McMichael 99 and the linebacker Lance Taylor empathy two combined for the tackle so far in the first half Oklahoma 87 yards rushing the Texas 59 but again the newlook Texas offense the passing game is what led them to that touchdown a moment ago and the clock continues to count down Texas or Oklahoma is not play conservative they'll get lapto go straight over three to the 30 on his feet from the 34 yard line David Overstreet gets a first down for Oklahoma he started to place the injured Billy Sims who we have not seen in the first half barkbark Yannone again makes the tackle for Texas the weak side linebacker number 42 they started the clock again Oklahoma has not used up their last remaining time out I think Donna their own in inside it on 40 I'll probably happy to get into a progress ago make some adjustments is over speed has tripped up as it takes the hand off Elvis peacock has not been any kind of factor this bird cap less than 10 seconds to play Steve McMichael again I made the tackle there's the Cotton Bowl in Dallas Texas this score X is 10 Oklahoma 3 we'll be back with halftime activities in just a moment you",

  "transcript": "through you this this is gonna be one of the greatest knowledge football entrees around and I I guess what we said earlier about both teams having good Pickers truth point team that won the toss decided to take the win they see the Texas flag being rolled up taking off the billyoh you Roughnecks about to leave the field and right straight up the middle of the seat you can see on one side it's all rights on one side it's already the 72nd meeting between these two great universities series all in favor of Texas the overall series 42 Texas wins 26 for Oklahoma three times of course Oklahomans come right back and say well yes but we've won five of the last six and last year of course a six to six time seems funny scuse me Jerry well Chris that's six to sixty I think that probably has made this game even more important in the eyes of all these people especially for Thomas lot and then again remember that this is Earl Campbell last football game against Oklahoma as long you know you were talking earlier about how Thomas watt made his first start a humidor well Marc McMahon has never played in the Texas Open in the football head and it's an entirely different situation you run faster you get hit harder this entirely new exponent you know we were down in Austin Monday and Brad shirt Oh Malik great common said you were so tired before the if you come off the peel the first half you can barely get up the ramp and then as you come down again you can hardly wait to get on it's just that kind of game Roma Bahn sha'ban you see him right there it would be kicking off for Oklahoma the University of Texas with all kinds of speed back deep they you see on the far side is Alfred Jackson on the near side will be number 28 26 Johnny lamb Jones that's a couple of speedy youngsters oh it is indeed if you remember last year Chris the Texas had that kind of quickie handoff play well they no longer do that it's just a straight kick off the time that is Oklahoma Texas game is underway shovin is going to kick it right out Texas football first and ten at the 20yard line you'll notice Earl Campbell will always be the last one to the backfield he takes his time like Jim Brown used to to get to that hole now they strike up the eyes of Texas the band mr. cute take a look at the Sooner defense alleged kid lost 74 field table there was a question about him this week he hurt his knee in practice but he's out there ready to go Dave Hutchins 70 we'll set the offensive back there for you in a moment Macbeth 17 the quarterback they'll start from me I Earl Campbell go back ham Jones the I back the pitch to Campbell number 20 26 very friggin number 28 Georgia company and there's Earl Campbell again you'll see how slow he is Texas usually waited till late in the first quarter they say in a starting backfield mark Macbeth the quarterback number 17 starting his first Oklahoma Texas game ham Jones a healthy ham Jones a healthy Earl and the great speech through the Olympic gold medal winner lamb Jones Johnny lamb Jones at the flanker fish is in now for Jackson as a split in Texas again the iformation second and eight this is Campbell he wants to throw they've been practicing for quite a while this year Chris and Johnny we have had never used it before Johnny lamb Jones is open but Reggie Mathis gets to Earl before he can really talk is on and bro the Sooners have the first big break in his football game Oklahoma first and ten at the Texas 13 and off goes to David Overstreet starting in place of the injured Billy Sims Overstreet our freshman out of Big Sandy Texas will set that Oklahoma offensive back before you Steve McMichael made the tackle for Texas this Texas offensive defensive unit the first unit of course team has not been scored on well but it's also a very young one critter only two seniors Bradsher and Morgan Copeland starting and so it's really untested rot the quarterback peacock Overstreet the half backs Kenny King at fullback King is number 30 Oklahoma jumps across there and it's going to be Sam Huff on the right we made the big move first Oklahoma had a second and nine up to 12 so it'll cost the Senators five and Jerry mistakes like that seem to happen in this ballgame well this is the first time for Sammy Jack to play in this football game and I know he's a little bit on the nervous side and because that's going to happen to somebody that the first time they play in this ballgame you cannot imagine you know you were talking together to go about the ramp and how you have trouble walking up it at the half let me tell you they said that's the most famous ramp in the world and these these football players to walk into this stadium is just awesome it is second and fourteen Oklahoma the ball at the 17 yard line Kenny King loses the football before raise safety coming off the bill a click overhead credit Johnny Johnson and Texas fights right back in stops Oklahoma so two turnarounds one for each team and right back just about where we started running for the opening kickoff for is that's one of the problems that Oklahoma's had this year that had some problems in holding on to the football and now we'll see what happens in Texas lives up Alfred Jackson's close to the bottom of the screen lamb Jones is up the top out of your picture Dallas macbeth turns looks his foot back field behind him 60 to watch Reggie KITT lon he'll make a lot of unassisted tackles all by himself from that nose guard spot this is a very interesting young man about three weeks ago they told him that he was hurt that they were going to operate on his mate he's no sir you're not going to cut my knee open again I'm gonna play football for the University of Oklahoma watch him today this time up to the top of the screen Sam Jones at the bottom that fast second down nine Texans from the 15yard line Campbell County Fair sixtytwo again Grichuk in law 85 linebacker Darryl hunt combined to make the tackle you know Chris earlier in the week coach Akers expressed concern because of his offensive one to feeding people in it really hadn't been tested by quick aggressive big defense running against Virginia is one thing learning against Oklahoma was quite another miss Texas is finding out we have had a pass interception was intercepted by Oklahoma a fumble recovery tapped by Texas and has all been inside the Texas 20yard line so far 13 minutes left opening quarter third down eight Texas the ball on the 16 the horns need to get to the 24 for the first down Rock Creek bath quarterback on the option handoff and the first and Joan just burst over the right side Darryl hunt 85 linebacker Jack Henderson 19 great Birgit 26 on the tacos Texas just short of the first down stick and again it's a punting situation in coach Akers also expressed concern about that because Russell Amon did have a punt brought earlier this year he has not had to put many times with that great Texas offense he's back there now inside his 10yard line deep for Oklahoma number 11 is on their Freddy Nixon good snap no rush by Oklahoma hurts them in six short with a kick Nixon has it on the length of 50 in the 46 rival exit about 70 yards and Oklahoma starts its second position again and Texas territory I don't believe Russell really got his foot into that one it was kind of a low squid squid ler and Freddie Nixon took it on the dead run their time out on the field the score alcohol but I think Texas nothing they Chrysler's styling center possession of the game the Texas 46 78\u00b0 to top the bowl though authorities 10 to 20 Oklahoma is the wind at his back top I'm a slob six yards tackle by Ricki Church the number eight strong safety for Texas part of the cloud here at the Cotton Bowl and once again as every year it seems the sellout crowd it has been held in Dallas here at the Cotton Bowl since 1929 minute picture the great Texas State Fair that is now underway rot the Oklahoma quarterback second down for Sooners we have to have a first down in this game we do now a penny King across to the Texas 34 first down Oklahoma Johnny Johnson 27 Ricky churchmen number eight tackle for the University of Texas and Kenny king who has had some shoulder problems looks like he may be bothered a bit again he hurt his shoulder against Kansas look at the way he's holding his arm there they they've had to take Kenny out on during the first part of the last two or three games and it'll be Vicki Ray Anderson a young junior and he's a super good fullback Oklahoma wishbone first and ten and off sucker man David Overstreet Big Sandy Texas Steve McMichael number 99 makes the tackle curse the basic alignment for Texas and defense is the same as it has been in the past it's a little more aggressive you'll see the linebackers move a little bit more and the defensive backs rush up very quickly then they don't gain on the plate will be his second down and ten Oklahoma football Texas 34 yard line Steve Rhodes with the bottom of the screen six foot 210 sophomore out of Kennedy Texas I think that Elvis peacock slipped down he was supposed to take out a number 42 mark okay he slipped out and Martin only came right over the top of him and also Tommy a lot tripped on Elvis peacock 103 Texas linebackers they're good ones it is third down 12 Oklahoma down at the 36 they need to get to the Texas 24 for the first down lop the quarterback he will not make it now at the 30yard line Ricky Church the number eight Brad share 77 combine to make the tackle for Texas brad is one of the few seniors on the defense and he's one of those players who has his big games against the big teams he seems to get especially up for Oklahoma AM Texas Tech it is fourth down at six the ball at the 30 and he resumed of on Xiamen if it is he down on a 36 yard line but here it will hold long shaman to attempt a 46yard field goal and it's got the distance pixely 46yard field all by of Obon shaman and jumps out in front of Texas breed nothing 9 minutes 28 seconds left in the first quarter here at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas cheerleaders on the sidelines but again that first ring Texas offense is not give up a touchdown see they haven't get up that they're shown that I said the more aggressiveness this year these three linebackers he'll tell you Lance Taylor has a chance to be a superstar but as a group they're very balanced very aggressive group watch Ellen will kick off for Oklahoma I'm over in dad out on the field play over the end zone a you see Johnny Manziel number 26 we need to get his hands on the football but it's tough but God showman has that kind of wind advantage so Texas once again let started its own 20yard line and it certainly in the first quarter the early going Texas has had no kind of field position at all we've got a flag down here and we may come back to try to kick this one over I'm sure Texas like that kick it again they certainly would because they they've had a goal inside the 20 millions our first quarter overtime I'd like to see Johnny lamb or Alford get some Running Room I don't think that's gonna make a whole lot of difference now is the the win is it Schama package was bought shaman and irk Slavin both have the ability to kick it through the uprights Oklahoma scoring drive 60 yards on six plays Silvan shaman takes it back to the 35yard line I will kick off from there at the top of the screen number two Alfred Jackson the bottom of the screen number 26 Olympic sprinter Johnny lamb Jones I'm Shaolin kicks it off this one will be run back look at it chance here Donnie lands on the 10 six foot 288 pounds it really hit him here's the replay on and then Johnny lamb Jones is very hard to bring down in the open field this is a great tackle that's one way to stop any missed equipment down Texas again with very poor field position the Longhorns 1st and 10 the football at the horn zone 13 yard line they have not been across their own 30 yet in the first quarter near backfill behind mark macbeth jones and campbell pick bath keeps it himself it gets short yardage for the Oklahoma players leaves with a football they will pump it back down we back this on down yes mark is a sophomore from Corpus Christi King he's the better runner at the two were their option make the hit for Oklahoma mark Macbeth you see right there the fine young Texas quarterback looks like it might be a knee as an eight point four yard rushing average has thrown for three touchdowns and he is going to be helped off the field boy there's a there's a big blow fortunately done on he has played quite a bit this year he's the better pass wait until he has the howitzer for right arm PML for Jackson's mail fax at a school record an 88yard touchdown pass I want to throw for John honey he's playing in his hometown Dallas Texas sophomore second six Texas at their own 17 yard line and up goes to Campbell gets short yardage there cold tapers 74 along with Darryl hunt 85 make the tackle on Campbell Oklahoma Jerry has had great success in containing if one can do that Earl Campbell then the three times he's played against the Sooners this is not I think perhaps this might be roles most favorite game but it has not been his most successful over the past three years I know he would like to change that today out of the game was Alfred Jackson has quit in Steve Hall has come in devil tied in for Texas now as they put Lam Jones out of the spike at the top of the screen on e run the football knocked down and is going to be very close to a first down for Texas that was third down at about three jokes company 28 on the stop for Oklahoma and the official wants to take a look at it they'll bring the sticks in for a measurement maybe first down Texas or fourth down at very short yardage you mentioned Steve Hall coming in Chris he's the only Oklahoma Oklahoman on the Texas squad just inches short a gamble this early especially against the world the Oklahoma defense holds Texas just short on that third down play he missed it by about 6 inches Chris Earl Campbell looked longingly over at Fred Akers and held two fingers up and said nothing he was kind of thinking his model come on coach let us go for it no way not this early not on your own 23 yard line Oklahoma three Texas nothing eight minutes 15 seconds left in the first quarter here at the Cotton Bowl Russell are Slavin fourth down and one back inside his own 10yard line to kick deep for Rob was a good shot there Russell irks Leben the nation's number one punter last year is pretty Nixon number 11 for Oklahoma the lone band and deep mud return formation for the Sooners against the wind hi lazy kick Nixon fair catch takes it right at the oklahoma 38 yard line and that's where the Sooners will start first that was a 40yard punt 40 yard for us alerts women and before Oklahoma starts little time out of the field with a score Oklahoma 3 and Texas nothing Tuesday your Austin AGB people present the beautiful bath went down he has just been helped out of the Cotton Bowl I had down if he'll be back today and there he goes and of course John Arne our three freshmen played very very little nine out of 19 passing hundred and fifty two yards to see big fast at says Oklahoma goes to work and off to Kenny king number thirty the fullback baby gets a yard tough Texas defense Steve McMichael 99 Lance Taylor middle linebacker right there to make the hit and you can see already what the Texas books are talking about Steve it does seem much more aggressive Texas defense especially Lance Taylor they he shift a sophomore from El Paso and they feel that he can be one of the really super linebackers maybe allamerican before Easter Campbell has come out 86 in defensive end white Jefferson is in to replace him for Texas Oklahoma second at nine at its own 39 Thomas Hauk it's one maybe two and that's all 29 against Steve McMichael user or he's having a good day just a soft heart affair Texas six to 231 pounds nickname of bambam captain I can see why I'm question plays there down seven Oklahoma this is how you'd like to get the wishbone claim a third and long the origin you really have an advantage the wishbone really relies a lot on that first down play for big yardage and they can kind of finesse you Steve Rose would come to the bottom of this paint Oklahoma's only splint receiver Victor Hicks tied in at the top of the screen Oklahoma needs seven on third down Kenny King across to the 45 foot short of a first down and Oklahoma will be forced to put it away Kenny king the Texas side as the law defense to stop the suitors at fourth down and two on the 46 yard line deep for Texas Johnny Johnson secure deep man Don sado's second lady cover turn the country makes the catch at the 10yard line thanks guys he stepped out of an we stepped out of bounds back in about the 43 yard live we'll take another look at it and again while the top returners in college football Johnny Johnson amazingly decided to make the catch with great pressure watch these moves you know Wayman Claiborne was a great punt returner for Texas he's now with New England but the coaches will tell you the Johnson gets off to a quicker start he may not have the speed but he got enough for a 44 and Vaughn shaman was the only man between him and about a 90 9798 yard touchdown run at bonchama just barely got a hand on I've been telling them to swerve just a little bit I'll tell you what I think that's fairly obvious about the moves and the speed that Johnny lambs got 43 yards on the kick 37 yards on that return by Johnny Johnson and yes you're right Texas has speed everywhere first and 10 long runs great field position for the horns now at their own 48 yard line Johnny the quarterback the Earl Campbell runs over a couple Sooners still on his feet look at him look at him go that is the Earl Campbell of old this isn't quite wide enough today for Texas they said they're gonna call him down though back at 4:46 let's let's see if he is makes a nice move of the outside shot yeah I think he's yep and his knee went down that is some kind of effort Earl Campbell number one in the nation in scoring averaging 14 points a game seventh in the nation in rushing 124 points seven yards a game and emotion for Texas second down and 12 and across nobody there an Oklahoma swarms on a drill tape number five on John honey number 10 the young quarterback i mighta come off the wrong way because there was nobody there but white shirts you know Akers talked about how both on in the fat half play but my math has worked with the first string more than Ani and it looked like John went one way and everybody else went the other that time Texas will lose four on the play make it third down now and 14 for the Longhorns the ball at the Texas 44 yard line good shot there the Texas huddle Texas of course in the burn orange they are the home team today Oklahoma in the road white body split flanker back for the first Texas pass as far as the quarterback on he wants to run now at the 45 at midfield they're gonna call a clip on Texas on the house I'm afraid it was either oiler johnnyland pushing oklahoma player but here at number 33 finally made the tackle and John honey who's advertised as the passing quarterback we took Reid Bronco that's really going to be demoralizing Texas Longhorns they've had Johnny lamb on a super run back off that punt and then he stepped down a bounds for Campbell went down just barely touched a V and now in a pretty good run by the quarterback Johnny they get a clip and you know there's one play could make a difference in a football game and I think the momentum kind of shifted a little bit there to it Texas Longhorns and now they've maybe perhaps Oklahoma may have it back after play like that hey a correction third down and nine it should be handily marked from the spot of the foul but instead of a first and ten inside

at all bouncing 35minute takes a Texas roll authority picked up at the 48 yard line but he Nixon 48 yard line he ruled him down there rustlers David did not help on with his past cuts but it worked out very well for Texas it was a lucky it was a good pump at a lucky punch is here it takes a very good Texas roll pretty Nixon picks it up and Steve Hall dropping him and he is on the ground 40yard punt in minus four yards returned the kind they needed against the governor is exactly half this crowd that had a few 48 first attend Kenny king to go back and post at the top of the screen Thomas logic option to rob authority over Oh the flag was thrown holding against the sooner diploma 15 and the Sooners have hurt themselves with penalties here in this second half Jerry they certainly have they've had a college with penalties but one thing that we have not seen is the fumble problems in Oklahoma Hannah early in the season fifteen yards something about this fixes to the fence what is an awesome to see versus scoring defense five points a game but nobody really knew how good they were until today because they had faith to Thomas a lot 38 yards per game Russian rice and played at the passing last week 155 yards for hanging but still this is an outstanding Oklahoma first in 24 Alba's peacock Michael 99 ed it right there also Lance Taylor 32 take a look at this play again Elvis peacock goes just right up the middle and look at the whole host of orange jersey Texas Longhorn Lance Taylor say sorry about that mr. peacock we think you better stay down this it's a second 21 Oklahoma the ball their own 38 yard line good defense by Texas then Blackwood was over there 37 Derek Hackett from the great incomplete its third dog bowl garnish for Oklahoma Kenny King was wide open over on the opposite side of the field they weren't really paying a lot of attention to it you'll notice that he went in motion just before the play started Oklahoma brings in a whole new set of fresh receivers the over number nine comes in Bobby Kimball 21 comes in open up this tile this 21 walk goes way we he was definitely open Texas defense look confused by that formation there's how many people were coming out and put three wide receivers and Victor pigs the tide in they must have thought they're playing rice almost Shelvin is Dallin get up in the air fish a little ride away I don't think the kick was blocked Prez I think he just got it off the side of his foot I could very easily be mistaken on that one it went straight up in the air looked like it was blocked away at the ball after this one off his foot but of course roughing the kicker tall was made they're talking it over right now Barry Switzer out on the field if I can explanation the official and maybe it was running into the kicker one or two less with penalty it takes it all the way to the Texas 47 yard line it'll still be fourth down Vaughn shaman is up he's alright they still have to punt it now the soon as he stepped in it they want to call the timeout here to talk about this 15 seconds left in the third quarter I would echo homers call the timeout looks like they're gonna cook try to kick a field goal Chris with a win behind him that'll bring it let's see it'll be the 464 yards fair play is that what is up the forty six and a half yard line actually I thought shaman you see him crops down there much as it was at Ohio State for that big field gold and wanted for Oklahoma he meditates actually before he kicks he's into Transcendental Meditation and does it helps relax him that has to be the toughest kick of their seen anybody make for pressure last play of the game against Ohio State I was amazing survived the celebration was going to Barry okay so Texas says let's see if your guy can do it our guy does Russell inseam is fifty 64yard to go for the horns here real audience too much chance to celebrate they're excited about a big white gems it is a little dance out there we'll take over first intent and its own 20yard line he had the distance first it was long enough to move it off the side miss Texas Ted Oklahoma six we have just nine seconds left in the third quarter there again some of a sellout crowd here at the Cotton Bowl 72,000 thirtytwo capacity for the 32nd consecutive year they were selling tickets outside the Cotton Bowl for $100 apiece before kickoff people were glad to pay it Texas first and 10 minutes 20 and up we'll take a look at this and he misses her it's hard dog tackle Earl Campbell and Johnny Lam Jones out here just in the edge of your screen throws a nice the score into the final 15 minutes first and ten horns at their own 45 Campbell has it and goes down on at the 45 yard line Earl Campbell today 17 carries for 92 yards he's not gone over the 100 yard mark against all of us the soda ban spikes up for another background detectives second down still 10 Texas at the 45 in motion goes Johnny lamb Jones down to the bottom of the screen i formation Longhorns gamble stiff arms one man goes to 45 full head of steam barrels off to the forty seven or eight tackle made by Perry Frank at 26 or Campbell gets up a little slow there as he starts back to Hubbell George come be 28 second is at 19 also in on the stop Bob Tyler rose that's what an allamerican back will do for you that was a four yard loss you know almost any other running back and he put a little move on allamerican linebacker Daryl nut got into the backfield all the Blitz but Daryl just couldn't hold on is this a big down there down seven for Texas the football at their 48 keep in mind the aim to reach the Oklahoma 45 for a first down goes the top of the screen Jackson to the bottom of the screen catch it back to pass once the tow bar does it is tripped up Oh interception in from afforded me hello replay let's see if we can touch kitchen passes a little wobbly life I'd have been ten pleasure at the line of scrimmage rocket cries for Tony Peters cries forward he dropped it right there sixteen turn feeders let's see if they're gonna put there I feel gold Chris this I think would break the record this will be seventy yards when does that his back right everybody starts to stand Russell arts labor was trying to make college football history can I step down it goes or line and it we've got an injured player down the field holding his knee Terri Peters olivarium shutting off the deal you know it's really nice to see a game be as good as the buildup to it was set up about the Deuter packs nice football team the job they've done yargh question first its head over off at the 20 after the touchback Thomas thought the quarterback answer dammit over state we have not seen Billy Sims all day today thirtytwo middle linebacker I made the stop to go at the 22 less than 13 minutes to play here Texas 10 Oklahoma 6 the Almay touchdown of this football game scored late in the first half by Earl Campbell good shot a lot oklahoma quarterback watch this ball being chased comes out of the pocket he was very fortunate to get away from Brad sharing on this back there finally Morgan Copeland 38inch 10 to 30 to 80 made to stop and park his travel watch Thomas modest he's almost hit nearby a couple of Texas Longhorns and pocket collapses on him so he cuts up Balaam and cuts back to the left before he's tackled by number 32 Lance Taylor again and almost off Oklahoma has a third down and three 18 to 34 first job more than cookin 38 crash near 77 in this football game Bob Stallman in their cake motifs owner I kick into the web fair catch called more chicken for Texas 40 Texas Drive at the moment another 33 in the fourth quarter there's the score the more intense the Sooners six except a bill Mundy challenge get the other day at their own 40yard line a motion goes Johnny lamb Jones to the bottom of the screen gets the pass to Campbell there's the line of scrimmage George cubby 28 there's a Jeb that's made a fine number 71 on this look at Campbell now watch the jet bats there's a good block and then Campbell make some more in his own man George company fought right with him and finally held on for the tackle you know Jeb is 270 pounds and he's lost 35 pounds Oh second down floor is Campbell against sixes gets him close to the hundred mark Johnny ham Jones short came there close to a Texas first down in Oklahoma Territory at the 46 yard line Reggie came off 62 George company 28 all the tackles they want to call for a measurement here to check this up Earl is now over 100 yards 19 carries for 101 yards Joey how close are they that's just about the way it's only third down one step third down Texas less than a yard to go football on the oklahoma 46 yard line keep in mind and Jerry point out oh yeah this couldn't be a very big factor in this game during Texas will play the fourth quarter with that wind that is whirling some highs up near 20 miles an hour and it's back and we've got 10 to the half minutes left in this football game but Oklahoma trailing Texas ten to six of course remember it's the big play any time for either one of these two schools wonder who'll get it third down Earl Campbell spins away he's alive sometimes wonder what you have to do to stop him good that's a quick end they just spin away spin away well he hit him solid but he had to get healthy then it took 4 up to bring him down good I believe that young man's fired up today 20 carries 113 yards for the senior from Texas first down 10 at the Oklahoma 33 yard line for Texas Jones gets just jump back there send these little skinny guys in here against this is 5 9 185 Johnny ham just got tossed back then how am I going to relief for the Oklahoma defense he got caught it it was doing Darryl and Reggie Kinlaw that's an awful lot for little Johnny get called in between Johnny am talking over the huddle no call that one again well that was you know that was that was an easy one for the Oklahoma Sooners they've been watching Earl Campbell come down his throat all afternoon that was that was that was kind of like a breeder for him I guess by Crockett flanker at the bottom of the screen Alfred Jackson top of the screen Texas second down ten at the Oklahoma 33 yard line and up again it is Jones ham of course up the middle I did the 30yard line it'll be third down this will be a long yardage play for Texas now and he's hurt he's hurt oh it might be the hamstring he's had problem ed for two years Johnny Hampton down on the field here at the Cotton Bowl the football head at the 30 yard line it'll be third down and seven Texas as they're working over Johnny lamb Jones Hamblin Texas you know perhaps Telecaster and I want to get an explanation is why ones gone hand boys call layout is a timeout right now on the field there's no I guess now we're going to try to get off the field there so we won't think of right here I'm glad they call it you know Copeland Johnny Jones and been tough on us though by play guys did make some distinction lamb and ham how they go for that Steve well Johnny cam Jones is from Hamlin and Johnny lamb Jones from Lampasas and coach royal came up with that because at the first start of fall practice is Johnny Jones get over here and two guys in front down and run pretty fast have Jones by the way had ten carries for 14 yards Jones was on the bench Jimmie Johnson 29 of the speedsters in the backfield with Earl Campbell now this is third and seven Texas they need the Oklahoma 23 for the first time they throw for it it is incomplete a flag his dying's down they tried to hit the tight end killing Harris he got hella dope in there a flag went immediately up in the air as soon as the play started and Texas is walking back holding against the Longhorns they'll take this one this is earth sleep of territory that's a very key penalty because that's all I want the chip shot from there but now we're getting back into the 15 60 yard line we've been talking about the you'll see if this is the offensive line watch the fight in here let's see if we can spot it there's Rick Ingram probably Jeb bats take your pick those offensive linemen it's they've got to do something all these defensive guys coming full speed throwing every which way there's a good shot on the bench of Johnny cam Jones and they are working on that I think it is it seems to be the right ankle for the right foot 8:37 to go after the penalty in his third down 22 Texas still trying to get to the oklahoma 23 get you back to pass sets up the screen as it campbell 45 more knee and Donnie goes at the 41 yard line Earl Campbell on the screen it been a nice perception out there but Oklahoma came out quickly this is what the pros would like to see they can I find out that Earl Campbell can indeed catch the ball regi madness after that collision with Earl Campbell is little slow himself getting up and he's going to be escorted off the veal number five in a it is fourth down which like we're going to try it short field goal only 58 yards fortyeight the end zone 58 yard field goal attempt Russell are sleeping there again is Johnny hi I'm sure that's a lot of motion for him he thought maybe he'd get through a whole year without getting hurt Eric's navin 58 yard field goal was long enough as the disc kick off teeth you know a Russell was a quarterback in high school and all around he said a couple of years ago that he would really kind of like to get more contact as a Texas player coach royal said he gets all the contact on the metrostyle kicker was about a half step to full right here come the suitors today I've got to start moving 8 minutes 2 seconds up to playing the game 80 yards of the Texas gold Thomas odd first and ten at the 20 not Gibson last year it was a very critical extra point and the difference in a football game so it's going to be interesting in Oklahoma can score now see what when their strategy will be Bobby Kimball split in comes out of the bottom of the screen on the slot Oklahoma which both behind him goes that was peacock he's going to throw back to Thomas law he's got it at the 20 at the 25 to 30 first down at the 32 in the battle for Oklahoma first down and if you look back in the history of Oklahoma he was a little against Nebraska last year bass played the Levinson they'd use the razzledazzle to perfection well that was just one of those quiz last time you saw a quarterback at a back yard pass play first intent Oklahoma at that old 32 714 to play in the game going to throw it it's roads up around the 42 this does not look like an Oklahoma Texas game all of a sudden doesn't passing Tommy Bates back he's got plenty of protection plenty of time he spots Steve Road Steve was in the clear and gets it just at the marker that's good enough for another Oklahoma first down the Sooners begin gross fo5 left off the clock Chris tell you what we got a lot of football back here just under the sevenminute mark right now for us to ten Oklahoma lock keeps it makes it over 40 Texas 43yard line the Johnson at this point let's take a look at watches Thomas lot fake to worst the pitch out just at the exact moment that he got hit David Overstreet makes it down the sideline before he's knocked out about Chris back to live action now first intently a lot makes the pitch this time as peacock peacock snowballs you got tangled up over there as blocker David Overstreet the log wit Glenn Blackwood the rightful owner back to Texas short gain on the plate boy both bands are filming on fight songs now and every secondary again I'm amazed at Thomas lots of precision at that bitch get shot of the Texas sideline sideline camera John eat League lint roll up here upstairs caught on the action plan this delayed telecast by Katie uld be back it goes Thomas lot Boston Pro for Oklahoma down the steep roads Falls Oh flag goes down flag goes down at the 25 yard line it at number three was right there any vote to see some contact just the bollock released I think it was a trip I think NASA deference against Texas Oklahoma gets a big break there it is first down Sooners and the Texas 28 yard line again just like ohio state advantage Oh crawl up has been inside the Texas 20 I believe only once in this second half mob they break the wishbone sweat stop to the top of the screen and I'm King has a here is pullback playoff the wish ball hitting right up the middle and this is the biggest Gator of the day for Kenny king now watch he almost bub said Overstreet there that cuts to his right this is what makes good ek such a super valuable back he could go straight ahead he can cut he can go any way he wanted to ere compass owners wish Paul Thomas loss at the Texas 14 lot if sin himself puts up inside those to the Texas I'll tell you what guys next year let's just play the fourth it always seems to come down to this doesn't it it really does sir his second meeting Oklahoma Texas second and five Oklahoma fall on the tenth man in motion Mitch Galvez big at the ten Hickok stumbles down to about the six I believe it was the year before last when Horace ivory may that 37yard touchdown lancedale 32 johnny johnson 27 on the stop for Texas and now it is third down and two Oklahoma the Texas six yard line which tape against Texas this is a tough two the Sooners need to get to the for Thomas Lott says he can't hear steps away I can't imagine why I can't hear how the slap talks in the official ready to go now third down to Oklahoma Bob Gibson himself makes the pitch to peacock peacock after 500 miles to the 4 yard line he's going to be close Chris that was almost a forward pass there's a pitch off you're riding great let's take a look at it one more time tommyrot and I think he thought that Elvis peacock was a little bit behind him he pit bitchin to I believe it was a forward pass that's going to be a legal forward pass Barry Switzer says they need new statistical pitch outs attempted pitch shots completed it is fourth down they say he is just shy of the first title where they mark it it is just inside the five yeah if the nose of the ball touches to four it is a first down lock keeps it cuts up inside bacon to play the game Loredana see watch this big fourth down play Thomas lot number six here comes Johnny Johnson he makes the tackle stands him up he's also hurt Texas is held Oklahoma throw pause here with four minutes and three seconds up to play Texas 13 Oklahoma six the game made by Texas free safety number 27 Johnny Johnson sophomore from Lagrange Texas he was the injured player is back up and off the field in his own car in Texas has it first and 10 at the 5 at Oklahoma will be going for the football with 403 left to play penetrated as history goes down George Kumbi wraps it up at the 3 yard line I would have thought Virgil would be given to Earl three times and then let her Russell kick it out hey 49 to play both teams have two first downs two timeouts I should say in this football game 339 Oklahoma trails Texas 13 to 6 Dave all tied in comes in Auburn Jackson comes out",

to Texas you know Steve we were talking in the top of the football game we talked about the fact that Texas really didn't know how good they were Texas did not play a team that was a very good team up until now I'll tell you what Texas has a good football team there's no doubt in my mind both of Meserve to be in the top five Thomas Lawton Oklahoma second down five at the 40yard line locked back to throw wide open is Bobby Kimball has it procs so it's a graphical form bass and five seconds left Thomas lot back to pass and he waves Steve Rhoads out just a little bit further there he is Steve Rhoads 424 bless his heart II just here's a big one third down prime Oklahoma now they need to reach almost the 45 for the first down I'm sure aside part out comes Thomas lot in comes the road is very soon sir he has never lost to Texas the wrong horn fans are cheering by think they're cheering one down too soon this is fourth down Dean Blevins in to throw more eggs alevins Campbell's out of the

a flag goes in the air and delay of the game against Texas one minute 11 seconds left to play here with the cotton ball it is Texas leading Oklahoma 13 to 6 a little too much celebration on that fourth down play costumes some time in five yards and of course I'm sure Fred Akers thought a home owned house well maybe less alert sleeping take a field goal but Texas fans starting to chair we're number one they came into this game unbeaten threeandoh ranked number five in the nation Oklahoma for Novak number two running back country keeps it himself close to 40 goes one strong saftey amantha tackle there's hairs about Earl is leading the blocking because he'll block here Randy cuts upfield inside our own cabin dear ceiling as such the Texas has lost another player David stuttered one of the few seniors on offense right tackle is out nearly save a sophomore in this place before 7:15 three seconds to play in the game Texas 13 Oklahoma 6 the Longhorn fans who have not won this football game since nineteen seven had the chance to celebrate now there's coach corn acres oculus quarterback what do you think don't fumble would you notice all the last play they did there wasn't a handoff quarterback kept the ball I think that's the strategy now instead of giving it time sure to run why to run out the clock as much as possible you're right 30 seconds and in a kitchen for Texas second house I hate his balls Oklahoma cannot stop the clock this will be a thirddown perplexes takers right that young football team I have a feeling mr. acres is going to get a ride across the field down he goes again and I think there's someone else we have to remember that's a young quarterback he came in after the two top quarterbacks are knocked out the kitchen no no player on this Oklahoma team at openings connection everyone earl campbell on a 50yard line after these want to really save on that paneling job well now is the time at Handy Dan as beat Oklahoma Texas 13 Oklahoma six and a is he the Oklahoma people and for the Sutter fans a long trip back across the Red River I'll tell you they I know they have to be thinking about this one in the many missed opportunities there of course the two governors in states governor Gabriel or on the right governor das course and the middle they're ready to exchange the trophy the gold have trophy symbolic there's great rivalry in college football I'm gonna promise kind of glum there well I can certainly sympathize with him and when the OAU fans because it's a fantastic team it's played exceptionally well there are the final statistics Oklahoma really have the statistics today fuel positioning kicking it was a big difference for Oklahoma and first downs nine for Texas Darryl well just go in the booth try to get him over here in a second yards rushing 193 yards for Oklahoma 120 yards for Texas in passing 46 yards Oklahoma 57 for Texas they you can see total yards both these teams well off their statistics over earlier games 239 total yards to 177 two turnovers Texas two mistakes but they were early Oklahoma one fumble and the pumps of course you see two great punters Russell Erik Slavin along with Obon shaman put on prodigious play today Texas beats Oklahoma 13 to 6 and there are many people in Texas happy about that that Darryl one I thought I've got congratulations coach well it was just a tremendous plan and as I told you at halftime not that the job that Fred Akers has done with our football program has just been marvelous the fantastic job that he and his coaching staff have done it was a total team victory yeah I've never seen a game so fiercely thought of course every game I've ever come to the Texas Oklahoma game has been fiercely caught it's a big thrill for us and it gets our program back up where it once was and I'm just tickled to death for Fred and and all the football players and his entire coaching staff I'm sure I'll take his hat off you coach well those are Darrell royal players down there well I tell you what they're their friend a KERS coach coach what a job that the two quarterbacks down early and to come back and the pressure on that young man what a game well Randy got a very severe knee injury last year and I thought his football career was over and this shows you what tenacity will do it shows you what courage will do he hung in there I don't see how anybody could have possibly expected Rendon McEachern to do any more he handled the ball with confidence he threw the ball expertly when he was called on to throw it I just I'm tickle death for Randy because it's been a long hard road for it I also would single out what Jefferson I thought what what was in this ball game totally as much as any player I've ever seen coach earl campbell again athlete you get the same arrows is good at football players I've ever been around I've said that before and you get in back in that I formation at coach Akers has his head of steam he is hard to bring down and both are the defenses it proved this game of emotion well do you think I thought it'd be a lowscoring ballgame a lot of folks thought it would be a highscoring ballgame I really did didn't think we the team would take both of us have outstanding defensive football teams I think this is the finest defensive football team Texas has had congratulations the University of Texas the Fred acres down on the field Kota Briscoe is just accepting the trophy from Governor David Boren of Oklahoma and Texas fans aren't leaving here they are celebrating his great victory for the University of Texas once again the final

last year from Pasadena and often in the backfield Phil Taber of Oklahoma stop Jones Donny ham Phil's 25 as soon as he got the handoff 74 Phil careful after Laura goes up Oklahoma's defense its courts at night Chris Farrell hunt for one of the rare Oklahoma blitzes on that coming in from his right side linebacker position that's got to be a frightening thing for a brand new freshman quarterback in a game like this well Randy Randy is a senior squad man he's had a lot of knee problems he had a lot of potential in his head I think at least two knee operations thanks Laban spots going to be fielded taken down on one knee by Zach Henderson at the Oklahoma 44 yard line as the Sun comes out of it now go overcast and Alan Scott the football game and it'll be Oklahoma's football first weekend ahead 40 left in the first quarter that's 33 yards fire later I'll make my second apology of probably many that I'll make today to the senior who I call the freshman I'll tell ya it looks like we're looking one of our replays Deva you're looking off the Texas bench at the same spot almost the same huddle around now John Ani and they're taking a look at his right leg it looks like his oklahoma has it first at 10 at the 44 yard line handoff goes to kenny king will go back he goes nowhere Steve McMichael number 99 right tackle makes a stop for Texas Morgan copeland strong side linebacker any cake number 30 does not have a big impressive statistics of a year ago for the suitor so far he's gone full stamps about it sometime running today second down and nine Oklahoma football at the Sooners own forty six votes foot to the top of the screen official play to is a second strength player because sample but obviously Texas has death the defensive end they do indeed and he made an excellent play there it's going to be for Oklahoma now a loss on the plains of his third down and throw 40 seconds truck running left in the first quarter if it might Oklahoma has to get to the Texas 41 for a first down and off on the reverse two over straightaway why Jefferson became number also ruin the timing on the plane and the Texas defense stalls Oklahoma the Sooners will have to pawn it they're in a hurry to do it try to get the wind advantage now Oklahoma to make sure they get the win tonight has taken a timeout here twentyone seconds left to play in the first quarter it is Oklahoma State Texas something the Sooners call their first timeout just to make sure that they had that wind advantage and cheering see you I'll tell you what I don't think I've seen a firedup Texas beef bitch like that in a long time I think you can put part of that to you there's an awful lot of those thoughts out there playing in their first Oklahoma Texas game it's incidentally they had John pony up and walking around he was not living backed out Lavinia surrounding making a diagnosis through what the situation is I think that perhaps we have a pretty good chance of seeing Johnny Kovac the ball game they talk about football being a game of emotion I think that's probably why both defenses are playing so well because of defense she can let your emotions carry Oklahoma has to 5/4 in 14 Bob Chopin is plenteous I'm Bill Hicks of beauty I spiral bounces the Texas five into the end zone and won a punt yogev on shaman with the wind that is back he kicked that 55 yards Texas again first and 10 pitch 20 yard line at 12 seconds left to play in the first quarter but all that has happened wrong for Texas in this first quarter Steve with injuries the two passes being intercepted with field position they're very fortunate probably that it says three nothing Oklahoma and I think they're also very fortunate that their young players haven't had a touchdown or two scored on them to get discouraged with all this happening by Java statistics you see punting 36 yard average he's improving on that right now for Oklahoma attention the third Texas quarterback in the football game split backs behind him option the air is caught gets away for a couple Sooners ours dropped down back your online it loses a couple Daryl humped a linebacker and I'll tell you Jerry there's no doubt about it the Sooners are really coming after him testing this young inexperienced quarterback well I think they're going to have to make their play at this point because I've been watching on the sidelines and I've been watching John Ani as he's been running and the football game and I think that may be what we're getting ready to receive right now that's the end of the first quarter for the score Oklahoma 3 Texas that's not the second quarter runs the Cotton Bowl in Dallas Texas it is Oklahoma three Texas nothing this is the first place a second quarter rain of attention is the third Texas quarterback as its second eleventh for the horns with their old nineteen Campbell Jones behind him Earl Campbell gets a handoff and goes into a handful of silver 85 Darryl hunt 28 Jordan Humvee is the jaw Oklahoma linebackers were there along with defensive end number 26 Barry Bergen that is our question about the effect that Oklahoma fans know it as well as any look back on the bill right now to talk about the effect of your quarterback really and again audience better pastor and behind them now moving on this series but the next series you might see Texas where loose nut is there Don intent on is retracted pass for Texas that's his knee up his knee against gone he hated he was back nobody touched him he just went down let's take a look at it in slow motion again here's John ah nice to come on straight back he just goes like a like a falling out too much strain on that knee I think yep and I doubt if he'll be back what a courageous young man I I know the coaches probably wondered about it he said I want to go out try it again it fans from both sides standing up now on a product being taken off the field sophomore John on his 61 195 condors played his high school football right here in Dallas Texas of course you have beer or if you're Fred Akers about this game but you have Arkansas very important conference game coming up next week to quarterback so the way Russell arts later in his own end zone here the north end of the Cotton Bowl for the 19 Texas good snap big brushes on Butler excitement builds a colorful eyes fire pits it picks it up at the nineteen gross jokes our 51 so Robert said line reserve linebacker 51 and 60 respectfully made the tackles this putt went 70 yards hey you see Freddie Nixon takes it on the hop and does that Oklahoma fumble routine Jerry well I'm telling you what he did nobody around him nobody five yards from him and it just gets away from him but Freddie's fumbled a couple and so he's being very aware of the situation right at the moment senator's football first and 10 oklahoma at their own 25yard line 83 nothing early in the second quarter elvis peacock nowhere as there again is Steve McMichael number 99 the defensive tackle steve has come on very strong since the start of fall practice has been getting better every week and obviously he's having one of his best games over there goes Johnny into the Texas restaurant Donny is being helped on the sidelines at hero join mark McHale Texas number one quarterback in the dressing all at both the probably through for the day mop he goes along way now posted play for Oklahoma lock slips almost all kids back up and go stood off the 28 yard line for maybe three or four on the play when Blackwood right cornerback 37 made the stop Chris this is one reason why Barry Switzer is so high on on Tommy lot there goes John Ani into the dressing room and making the walk that he hoped that he would never make and that's a walk up the ramp the joint teammate Mark McMahon in the dressing room back to you they're down at six at the 29 yard line fake to Kenny king lot as it guys corn in his short of the first down Church the number 8 aid to stop for Texas also marked Oklahoma laughter punt whether she's been a defensive game has me coming in I think really most experts like movie consoles in Steve Rother will be a high scoring game by windy with an umlaut offensive team in the country in Texas on the field at Oklahoma right at the score points but it hadn't been that way about Xiamen spun into the wind is going to be blown dead at the 40yard line and that's where Texas will start first content in its own 40yard line there was a break in the action for the score Oklahoma three Texas nothing 103 Texas nothing 1210 left in the first half Texas with a football at their own 40yard line this time they said Jackson and jump up the top of the screen with Jonas is a wide slot man demon catcher in the third Texas quarterback calling the signals for the Longhorns 46 brandy has played quite a bit this year but obviously in the mopup situation when a gang was out of hand as we said he's had knee problems and this is his first real action in Texas and the intense conditions of a game like this yes it picks up seven its second down and three football on the 42 yard line try to update you on first quarter statistics here at a moment 1138 they play here in the first half second in three Texans they need to cross it field for the first down firstfirst out it's their first first down like a nice girl cuts back tough on tough run back end of the nineteen major stop on the play that's Texas first first down football appeal for over 48 yard line we've also the first time in Oklahoma Territory with air but a penalty set him back on a play of Texas at entrance the Oklahoma goal line first and ten at the sooner 48 catch will also throw on a heavy pressure looking for John did his overthrow he was well covered by Terry Peters number 16 I'll tell you that ball looked like it was 15 yards overthrown and Johnny lamb Jones almost caught up to it he caught touchdown pass last week that Marvin better that got away from him and you didn't had to run under it about 15 yards and then he got there fast enough to where he had to wait the catch is caught four passes this year for 103 yards but before he's caught two of them have been four touchdowns you know I think one part McEachern being in is a perhaps it is a triple option not so sure they'll have the true verbal option with pitches Oklahoma's faced with the same thing with Dean Blevins and JJ Jameson and is not letting the quarterback read the defense second down and Texas ketchup humbie 20 right there at the line of scrimmage no gain on the play 10:45 clock running left to play it let's look at this defensive play by George come be 28th of Oklahoma right there family income just comes in and he wraps him up and rows him down this is where the inexperience of the quarterback is going to hurt Texas right now Johnny lamb Jones has come out on third down and eight that brings Mike rocking it as a flanker he goes to the top of the screen out for Jackson to the bottom of the screen third and eight Texas at the 46 they need the Oklahoma 38 for the first down the kitchen wide open under fall open as we tied in Gil Harris the Oklahoma 30yard line yes he was wild wide open and social urge Laban is in we're going to see a field goal but then it will be 64 your and nobody is going to make any fun of this they know he could do it record of 67 all of us stop the clock here they've had some problems they're trying to get the their other unit back on the field it's probably just as well for Texas because Texas only had ten men on the field Gil Harris ran off the field that permissioning that pass and then came back also lurks layman you know you hear about a 67 yard field all that distance you automatically think it's a sucker's five he's the feel really great success is a conventional kicker where's his punts today at the city's also an excellent runner he as a matter of fact it's five out of seven this year field goals and at least three of them are from 50 yards or more he has 12 in his career from 48 yards of four and his 27 field goals is the career record for Texas and he's just a junior yes as we watch a warmup today he was putting him from 50 55 or 60 yards very easily which is the free stuff broke now it is at the Texas 46 yard line which means it is a 64 yard field goal attempt wind that his back hurts laven picks it up and over it Selina's baby you know I'm thinking about getting out of sports casting and becoming his agent new year would that be so the pros love him you'll notice it is it it's a half inch T now some kickers will use 2 inch T's but Russell uses the half inch so when he does turn pro it will be just a little adjustable for him I almost knocked himself out that followthrough 64yard pills or we are all tied at 3 3 because of that man right there in a super pill told us alerts later kicks it through the tie game of 1005 looked in the first half here with the cotton ball you know he knew what he wanted to do for a long time as he youngsters the game he was a winner of a local punt pass and kick case you know Barry Switzer is said that Russell H leggings without a doubt the finest field goal kicker in America he said he will probably go as perhaps the numberone draft pick in next year's NFL draft Eric's Leavitt picks it off you might as well buy a seat watch that it hits the upright at bounces back on the field and so Oklahoma will start first and ten at its own 20yard line and so far it has been the kicking game and defense turnovers have played a part Oklahoma formula ball inside the Texas 20 Texas had two passes intercepting yeah we are tied at 33 with 1005 to play in the first half there is one other significant stamp it is well worth noting Oklahoma's had to use two timeouts they have one left over it the slot to Kenny King a fullback in he almost broken tripped up at the 26 yard line Lance Taylor 32 middle linebacker Morgan Copeland the strong side linebacker 38 just got a hand on Kenny king who has this unbelievable speed he breaks in the open you gotta be quick to be a fullback when you play for Barry Switzer and he's got super good speed and he's he can bull straight ahead he can make the cuts Kenny king is great go by Bobby Kimball flipped receiver out of the picture at the top of the screen Thomas lock makes a hand up the back and Jefferson number 80 what a games like Jefferson his name it's a fantastic game for someone who has not started this year but both defenses are playing such aggressive football today that's just a solid hit until you get help to put him down and I got to wonder about the Tim Campbell I mean they haven't seen him which it is Dempsey like Jefferson so he might take a look on the Texas sideline and see what's about of a Tim Campbell third and five Oklahoma over speed lowers his head and hits Acosta 30 up to 33 I'll tell you if he had rocked up the ball and then looking just maybe to get one or two he might have broken that Jerry I believe you're exactly right the junk David Overstreet fresh Bonadies one the most highly touted young men to play football we come up to Oklahoma play football they're really high on this fine young man and I agree with you I think you could have gone all the way the hole was there he just had his head down was trying for a first time press down Oklahoma at their own 32 yard line and off any game yardage there got a few on the bargain poke lengths on side linebacker 38 Brad shear 77 makes the tackle maybe Oklahoma Society don't cry the other side now cool except that's where do I ever since right 827 left here in the first half Oklahoma Texas tied 33 here at the Cotton Bowl Steve Rhoads top of this being out of your picture now with receiver Oklahoma he's down on second down Kenny king to pull back at this two or three and that Texas defense is playing tough lands Kayla 32 I'm backers Steve McMichael number 99 softball declare Texas landscape also sophomore Akari young Texas defense Korean branch here at Morgan Copeland the only seniors obviously very aggressive one today Bobby Kimball goes out of the picture top of the screen for Oklahoma third down at eight Sooners 234 they need the 42 for the first down and up Overstreet on the play to cut the first down and over to go but he won't this time short yardage three maybe four yards tackles on the play Richmond number eight we go again so you'll see safety Johnny Johnson coming up but Oklahoma is playing some more conservatively this early in the going Ricky churchmen Martin Oney Johnny Johnson they're six orange shirts around there God Charlotte kicks it off bounces Texas 30 good Oklahoma rolled inside the 25 still rolling down to the 23 yard line espera Texas would hit it first down and 10 40yard punt it most of that was because of a good roll of course with 6th under their third string quarterback they have offensive problems we're watching local home ready almost hold your breath on every play with that speed have a timeout on the field out at the score is Oklahoma 3 Texas 3 we go back to live action punch to Oklahoma five forty four point two Texans for four 41.5 Chris Longhorns first and ten at their 23 yard line quarterback pitchman keeps it short yardage on the play gets just a couple up to the 25yard line I've got to imagine the Fred Akers every time McEachern carries the ball holds his breath and hopes he gets up I think the patient's home is ready Darryl hunt ready to throw up on the linebackers bat Steve look at some of these statistics and the going so far total yards rushing for Oklahoma 58:22 for Texas pro Campbell 16 yards on a carry not had a pass completed today to pass is intercepted by Oklahoma Deb faceted offensive guard now for Texas a replacement on the front line for the Longhorns second at eight 25yard line on both for scramble for ninth Texas is on it back at that all 20 as they had some problems getting out of it under center there the kitchen fumbled it and then he was about four or five yards by the line of scrimmage watch and he it just gets away from he can't find a handle on it instead of trying to pick it up and make something out he just went ahead and fell right on the ball which is what he should have done that way you've got the ball and chucked that one up too a little experience a little bit more confidence in yourself let's try it one more time guys again we have not had a pass completed today third down 13 we've had some completed but the wrong guys been sooner shirts taking Texas passes Alfred Jackson to the top of the screen Johnny lamb go to the bottom of the screen now hit drew from his own 20yard line keep in mind Texas needs to 33 for the first down of whistle sounds and Franken reversed the Johnny lamp Jones we've seen a lot on film this week but delay of the game and just what a place not to develop I don't know whether if that is whose fault that is the Texas coaches on the sidelines have hand signals to get the quarterback maybe McEachern um being used to being in sometimes finding out exactly what play was Green hi o'clock at the flanker comes in a place to Johnny lamp killed I'm sure Texas will try that play later in the game 533 lat first that we are tied at 3 3 Oklahoma Texas there is the 17 now for the horns the catch in his hands up the middle Campbell runs into one over one finally falls out game George come meet Reggie Kinlaw it's going to be a funny situation for Texas it turned into some kind of kicking game the kicks have made the difference on the school board a 46yard field Oklahoma at lunch common and a 64yard filled on Russell arcs Lebanon Texas three three oaks layman knee punt formation blended is back another world of pretty Nixon the 27 yard line for Oklahoma that's about a 54yard beauty Dixon you see they're trained to consider bed 49yard fun you know guys so many times the coaches will say to you you know when you talk to him the week before any football games well a kicking game is really going to make a lot of difference in you kind of really just pass it by it on the lot but I'll tell you well that this isn't one of the game for the kicking game really does make it a lot of different look at last year six six five I don't know if either team has put together well the one first down on the drive yet Thomas Rock makes the ride over on the street took that pitch Morgan : the strong side linebacker caged amount of outs and again you hold your breath when you watch this Jerry now watch Tommy lot and he gets caught and pitches over the guy's head and David Overstreet and there's only one man it can save the play and that's Morgan Copeland he pushed him out of bounds right there Matt Thomas lot has one of the softest touches on pitch outside and splitsecond timing is fantastic and six on the play second in for Oklahoma football the sooner 33 yard line and again it was a situation where the long way 14 yards on that play and one guy that could save the play bring a church good tackle lose leave a touchdown David Overstreet freshman has carried the ball seven times for 47 yards first and ten Oklahoma's at home 47 Kenny king at midfield mr. Kaufman Texas 49 yard line as the Oklahoma offense is starting to move down Steve McMichael offensive right tackle in Texas out is Steve Rhoads 24 over goes the top 49 second at six o'clock tips thanks for going quite a shock there Thomas Cole slow getting up Rock Park a noted linebacker is down on the field Texas has lost two quarterbacks today with injuries now the slide is down as home but is often don't think of break here is a stop of the action for the score Oklahoma three and Texas three what does American ingenuity give you a special Banking Department exclusively for women American ingenuity and gives me the young Americans upon his feet on the sidelines Golemon as object any king over the so to be fourth down for Oklahoma we'll take a look at the plan which lot was injured watch Dale as he fakes to Kenny Kagan he'll come around and watch right here as Limpy judgment Ricky churchmen catches him but the shoulder pads ride missed over just the breath knocked out of him he's going to be alright I think we'll see a Magna game so Chris after looked like the Sooners were on the move they're stalled out they've got a fun bunch dominating the win a beautiful high kick bounces at the five it's going to be first and ten sixteen seconds left to play and his Oklahoma 3 shaman again search limit so far the first half broken hunting and in place kicking believer righted saying I don't think either team has more than one first on it arrived today Oklahoma might have on that last drive before they stole that I think they did they got two first downs in that last Drive installed in the first half here come the Longhorns anything hatred again the third quarter back for Texas at Bath ladanyi or in the Texas dressing room of injuries everything our house completion that's the first pass complete for the day you know Alfred both his ribs against the",

before a record crowd of 55,000 718 at War Memorial Stadium and quickly slam Vanderbilt with a great defensive play quarterback Van Heflin backs up and is sacked by Jimmy Walker for a 10yard loss then

Hampton and then Jimmy Walker's sealed the cowboys faith with quarterback sack as Arkansas wins 19 to 7 salsa brought an unbeaten team into Razorback Stadium at another record crowd of 45,000 428 bask in the sunlight as the hurricane took a 7nothing advantage even though Jim Howard all did this past play for the 4 yard loss and Jimmy Walker tackles Tulsa's Dave Reiter on an eightyard sack the aroused porker defense again dumps later in the second half to help give the offense good field position so Ben Cohen's gets the call of a right tackle and the Booker's are on the scoreboard from 24 yards out then Ron Calcagno wastes little time and hitting Gary stickers for 15 yards deep in Tulsa Territory and again its Cowan's who uses every effort but I can saw on top 14 to 7 the defense rises to the occasion as walker slams Raider for a nine yard loss and then dan Hampton gives him another setback once more Walker Corral's later for a 9 yard loss and when Tulsa does get a pass off watch Mike Massey's great individual effort pay off seconds later it's Gerry Eck Wood who provides an insurance much down from five yards out so it's left to Walker to get his fourth sack for a total of 43 yards in losses as Arkansas goes free and OH on the season 21 to 30 now record Arkansas TCU crowd of 50 4430 jams War Memorial Stadium to see if the Hogs can defeat the frogs for a record 20th

yard gain the slowmotion camera shows the elusive Jerry ecwid slashing his way for 13 yards his short honest then boo to the 27yard field goal in the Razorbacks claimed a three to nothing edge the

incompletion now the Cougars try to drop back white faults the final second quarter threat with this 8 yard sack but the margin didn't stand up in the final 30 minutes and the porkers were suddenly out of the conference waits with a form and to record Arkansas returned home to yet another record crowd for homecoming the Razorbacks routed around coach Lou Holtz and set just one goal to be five

back returns it 20 yards a play later ecwid glides over right tackle or 11 big yard down technique keeps it right back : Arkansas has a nineteen to seven balls the defense then tees off on the Aggies nationally ranked offense Howard gets the 10 yard shot first Jerry Sexton gets a hand on Mosley then Walker wraps him up for 13 yards the foothill attack feeling mostly beats a fest retreat which results in a 23yard loss when Saxton and Brad Shep arrived on the scene the ensuing touchdown and gives Arkansas a twenty six to seven victory and a Christmas Day trip to the Fiesta Bowl as I can saw van onto the cotton bolls turf there remains some unfinished business the SMU Mustangs on a threatening day in Dallas SMU made more noise than the weatherman grabbing a 40 nothing lead over the Sun visitors Kevin Hamlin came off the bench and scrambled the Razorbacks into scoring position on a 10 yard run and Ron Cal Cagney puts the hugs on the scoreboard with this keeper the defense comes to life as that heaven gets a shirtsleeves and then SMU quarterback Mike Borg with only a minute left till intermission Cal Cagney drills dotty Bobo for 11 yards then Cal Cagney hits Ben Cohen's and he cuts inside Jerry equus black for 16 more Cowan's gets to the five on a quick opener but time runs up and the Hogs settle for a 22 yard field goal at halftime in the third quarter Cowen flocks and ecwid gains 15 yards around left in rollin sales shuts behind Equus block and gets 12 Orbach yards the 71 yard drive culminates as sales for its 17 yards around left in for a 17 to 14 Arkansas leads SMU much is the midfield but Larry Jackson is in the right place at the right time for another interception facing third and five Cal Cagney takes matters into his own hands on this driving 21 yard keeper Cal Kang me goes to the air and with the defender at his feet he lost the past or Robert Farrell surrounded in the end zone but Farrell goes up and gets the hogs at 24 to 14 leaves after a turnover Arkansas drives again as Michael Forrest Bulls his way for 16 yards and Ordonez as the field goal for the final 27 to 14 counts with possible conference championship marbles on the line Arkansas matched its fourgame win streak and national rankings against Texas second the Red Raiders sixgame winning streak run Kaltag knee found tight end Charles Flay open for 25 yards and a first down all of this started against the 22 mile an hour winds then Ben Cowan turned a delay pitch from Cal Cagney into a 22yard gain to set up the first score after a turnover produced a touchdown Arkansas was threatening again as Gerry ecwid raced for 11 yards then Cowan found that familiar crease behind Gregg Kalinda for 11 more yards ecwid scored the six points that Arkansas had 21 going against the wind before the quarter was over Cowan's had another drive alive with a 23 yard run he wound up the day with a hundred 48 yards and the season with a thousand and six the big fellow they call cowboy Michael Forrest then supplied a painful stiff arm and went 48 yards for a 28 nothing lead on the first play of the second period touchdown later Caltech me used the win for a 16yard past the clay across midfield and in slow motion Callens gets his final touchdown a fiveyard piece of art which put Arkansas ahead 42 nothing at halftime it remained for Thomas Brown to break loose in the fourth quarter on this explosive 47 yard tight rope to the left corner and Arkansas had 49 points equaling the school record for points in a conference game for the day Arkansas finished with 520 yards rushing its second best land figure and best effort against the major College opponents the kind of performance which would excite offensive coaches Larry Bechtel Jess French Don Pro John Konstantinos and Ken Turner the tech victory gave Arkansas a 9 and 2 record and two year mark exceeded only by one other team in America but more importantly it proved an axiom that Lou Holtz's told his team over the knauber great seasons don't just happened they're usually the result of seniors playing the best football of their collective careers Arkansas had 16 seniors in 1978 and they follow this Creed when the going got tough after the Houston loss they responded and responded what lies ahead remains to be seen but one thing is sure the Arkansas Razorbacks are building solidly upon the already great tradition it began as a season of anticipation coach Lou Holtz said to ultrasuccessful seasons behind him but his Arkansas Razorbacks were picked for a second division finish in the tough Southwest Conference the young Razorbacks rally around Holtz and win the league championship some questions were answered in the opener against Colorado State Thomas Brown ignited the offense while the defense got big plays from Billy Ray Smith and Jim Elliott senior quarterback Kevin Scanlon got the Hogs going through the air with passes to receivers like Bobby Duckworth Arkansas fans saw plenty of new wrinkles freshmen Gary Anderson proves that he belongs with exciting runs senior role in sales turns a screen pass into a big big play sales reception sets up a touchdown",

Benner on the Washington 42 in the backfield Edward be stacked up with a 39 yard line by Doug Martin the left tackle and cliff lafha of the nose guard they handoff deep in the backfield sometimes for the tailback there's the husky and that gives him more time to read his opening makes it more mandatory to for each offensive lineman to contain his block as long as possible because you can't afford one to slip by you can get them before they get to the line they have let us live facing a third Washington 39 leash will throw it he's under the gun he's it out he completes it but it's one of the first time of all and he's hit by Bruce Errol number 55 the inside linebacker they're short of a first down it is on the 38 yard line and information those John Anderson who was average 40 yards a kick this year he has been the team's punter for years in succession he's an allamerican linebacker Neal Glasgow and Kyle Heinrich are back confirmation they pushed it away call the war the hopper found himself you know I know it had to just be a reaction his knee is on the ground ball is in his hand and he's dead and that's the first mistake of the game and the mistake is against Michigan will be back Washington has a ball now in prime field position with no sir bond gets in the floor back Gary bricks clatter games the outside men and a tiein of Scott Greenwood moon fakes the hand over his head James is a deep threat of this one the average 22 yard catch this year he's a worldclass hurdler he can go and Don James view point is that he just doesn't know quite how good he is yet he may get tested today rest of the offensive line for washer Roger West with a left tackle bill form on the left guard Blair push the second team allamerican the center vpower the right guard just paves as the right back home like a downtown Michigan 49 go score that steal the tailfin to the 45 hit by the safety man Jim chicken we'll be third down six John will set the Michigan defense defensively Michigan is very similar to Washington in the way they line up we've got Dale kites at one at one tackle the other tackle was Curtis career it is Chris Godfrey now Steve graves is the down lineman the linebackers are Tom Tedesco and John Anderson those are the outside back with excellent movement run symptoms Nigeria meters in flames moon looking bro the shorty to feel real hasn't their top ground gainer he's just a sophomore for all America Washington Barry Salamis throwing the ball at first a second down during the year they have made like 67 conversions thrown the ball 165 times on third down only about 40 on first or second they've changed the scale they know they have an uphill battle they've got to throw at some on first and second down Briggs in motion number 81 Gibson a sophomore fullback from Everett Washington short yardage the average 4.8 yards a carry this year and he was squeezed by symptoms and leader the two inside linebackers those are the defensive ask John Derrick Howard and Jim Pickens two excellent football players Dwight Hicks the wolf man Mike jolly the corner those poor guys have been strong all year long like a six Michigan 33 no score 852 play in the first period garyun meter hitting very meter Junior Bo Schembechler anxiously watching his team defending its own territory it is on the 28 yard line of Michigan and they now have a third and 1 meter came out hugging his shoulder and mellow and they sophomore goes in her linebacker Ron Rowland has come in and Joe Steele is out Rowland is now the oh ah yes Michigan's an extremely tough team to run the ball against make sure they can take a look at how they get off on the ball most important thing for an offensive lineman westland Foreman push power and save you know they're ready because they know what they're playing Michigan 26 great devotion for the Sprint outdoors he's got one two three maybe one or two best pass receiver on the west coast he he was in a foot position you'll see he is along boom rolls out to get a better throwing angle he's got to be able to beat the linebackers make some excellent throw I love that kids motion people have stated what a good athlete he is he can throw it through now he runs 109 six first and goal to go seven yard line Gibson before Ron Gibson who put on 15 pounds before I get a little more heft to pull back he started as a tailback was quick he's got some strange Joe steals comes back in the game number 24 it is second down four to go for a Washington touchdown just under seven minutes to play in the first period no score in the Rose Bowl this flags are down now let's see what the official say morning Wolverine they were anxious they Adam on a long take account and they jumped this kid's been in good control you can see he kind of emphasizes one count gets movement out of four michigan defenders gets the ball smash and get the and easy to now for the half his team knocking who takes a row war first RB for a while boy couldn't wait to come he's beautiful on a roster she makes a face the jaws feel he's been there big brown Gator all it's an active call he gets out into a position to run or show he knows he's going in right now Jim Pickens trying to make the play Mike Charlie comes up he finds a hole in at six if and John this fellow is booth and his first couple of years at the University of Washington he was a disappointment and he just arrived at this year let's take a look at another angle he's a runner and a floor and let's credit Don James the good coach knows what he's got a quarterback doesn't make changes and doesn't listen to the people upstairs booing or yelling he let this kid develop and he's come a long way in each games all right Steve Robbins kick is up and it is good and he is 38 out of deploying though Washington has strict first time out of the store Washington seven Michigan nothing that was a 49yard drivein nine place for the Huskies is a kiss and they want plate the fielder he does under six after the 15 the University of Washington was number 13 Jeff Leland Michigan you remember last year got behind that's Washington looking at that blackboard offensive strategy with Warren Moon the man who just scored a touchdown Michigan got behind us three last year and couldn't catch up without a passing game we'll see what they do this year they've got a passing game that's why I think they can catch after first down family Edwards is a fail fast Russell Davis the fullback and reaches the quarterback my devotion lease on the option pictures Stanford editors for the 25 takes away at the 31 or 32 yard line by Michael Jackson and Antoine Richardson you don't like this Jackson could cover the field watching he can cover the bill the man that might have to play a little closer to the line of scrimmage is Kyle Heinrich you'll see he comes up on the tackle Jackson does his job pal Hendricks coming to the right of your screen here he gets the contact on the play he's getting it a little bit late when you're making it about eight or nine yards past the line of scrimmage you've got to make up a little bit more difference we're going to have the measurement at the 32 yard line of Michigan six minutes 15 seconds remaining in the first period and they are a foot short Michigan lost only one game this year that was the Minnesota 16 to nothing Washington lost 4 they lost three of their first four the last game they lost UCLA then watching in their living rooms they found out they were in the Rose Bowl when USC beat UCLA in the last second and the Huskies came back to Pasadena Kurt Stephenson Dennis Blair Michigan honor 32 that's Edwards and he has the first down Stanley Edward running off with a 35 yard line in Michigan he was shot by duck part and then flips the player from high above Pasadena the Goodyear blimp Columbia is bringing us the spectacular aerial view first down Wolverine on 35 against a five man plus three down linemen the two men standing up for Ashley linebackers late on a handoff to a fullback davus cranking laughs left tackles to the 37 yard line stop by the right tackle Dave brownie you can't just stand up and play a conventional type defense against a real fine Michigan offensive line that time Bruce harreld got in and helped running he got right up in the line of scrimmage he's been in on four or five plays in the first two drives and he is doing the right thing enough to keep them at least at bay you're watching 84 and 85 coming on and off the field they're bringing in place for the Michigan's then and there in there thirtysix leak hides the ball runs up he's going to be hit and drop on his 43 or 44 yard line by Richardson the outside linebacker bleach average 3.5 a run this year he's clever escaping a pathway and he had to be because both Kyle Heinrich and Greg Graham's were back there playing the deep secondary that's the third time leach intended to go long his men were covered he had to either throw a short try to make a great play read the ball regular season to Minnesota Michigan successful only three out of 13 down third down play probably why they love the rest of the year they did it very successfully but see how they do it for the third down and they are done here the final score coming up Notre Dame ran away from previous number one ranked Texas thirty eight to ten now Alma has a chance for the national title Michigan here feels they've lost only one game that they should have a shot at it Russell Davis and finished in very impressive style their regular season aphaia making the tackle on Russell Davis just over the 50 yard line Michigan on the Washington 49 this is the type of ball control game that Washington thought mission going to be playing there's the All American Dwight Hicks he's the Wolfman on the with Michigan defense second on second they gave him up family we've got floors down behind the line is driven Bruce harreld put the finish on him and he had to cut inside because Kyle Heinrich got in good pursuit to the outside that's the same play that's been going for seven or eight yards of pop ten on the previous two Edwards is in good position has to cut back because Heinrich forced it inside now they have a third down and eight from their own 49yard line they're trailing seven nothing two and a half minutes to play in the first period from Michigan again one athlete fritzsche Heinrich has done it several times today the second leading tackler on the team when you're a free safety and your statue that you've got to make plays like this one his father an allamerican quarterback he's named after Kyle Wolfe we used to work with Neil marvelous man great player New York giant von Heinrich in the secondary Anderson 52 class go west oh it stopped at the 27 yard line watching them with blue shirt or Wolverine down to cover the kick we'll be back in Pasadena with a song the University of Washington's seventh and Michigan nothing listen petals missing the man perfectly good for hitting first time Washington around her 27 or move report for us to steal has gone to the last room he has a hip pointer they say that he heard it in the first series he went back in a yurt on the goal line stand he will be back in the bargain but has gone to the locker room should return I chose teal has been such an instrumental part of their offense all year long it's got to be a big blow for him and Roland has a big job he'll have to watch Campinas Brown gaining this year and for 13 in the locker room right now there's going to be a legal delay illegal procedure against University of Washington just tase the right tackle move his brother Warren plays with the Pittsburgh Steelers the 25yard line a watch make a second of 12 single is that that's the play if you can decipher it go steal the best running back on the Washington Club is injured and in the wife and locker room we're in the last minute of play in the first period breaks emotion ballin has the ball I'll tell you how good steel was he feat that man out rollin and rollin ran for over a thousand yards last year steal a sophomore came in and beat him out this year listen Joe steel is one of the really bright prospects in Washington history he's come on Hugh McLean he wasn't too bad from up there I thought he's the best running back I've ever seen in my life and this kid is making people forget him well they say he's the bestest Michael Hayden and he's not gonna get to show it today it doesn't look like third down foot sigil cows moon throws and that's incomplete number 81 I was swept up and pushed around by hike dolly the official said no he was just going for the ball there's all information unless they reach for the handkerchief it doesn't really make much difference all right Notre Dame beat Texas 3810 and Alabama walked away from Ohio State 35 6 though we had to onesided games in the cotton sugar bowl and right after this game we'll be switching to Miami Florida for the Orange Bowl Oklahoma mmm they'll be ready with news the Texas got knocked off playing Arkansas and that shows right there a low front good wide hips next boom boom as you make covers on her 33 yard line falling on the ball is my golly number 16 when you talk about special teams Washington's gotta find when Mike roar back there their special teams captain said we'll have all our guys ready it's the offense and defense is trying to do their thing they've covered funds very well have been excellent on special teams almost got to turnover I seconds to go in the first period I should fall under all 33yard line for him he's out to the 42 very close to the first down Brock down fighting history let's go the left corner back and the clock shows that the first quarter is history in the 64th Rose Bowl game and the score the University of Washington whether you'll be able to play he is the star tailback of Washington and he could be sorely missed there least on second down we'll throw a fake he throws it away putting a great pathway started a Bible player the nose guard and browning the right tackle both of our excellent pass rushers Rick fleets really showed his cool there he's got third down in one yard though he used to be an automatic keep passing down he was trying to hit his man in the flat I played he couldn't get the ball to him he had no chance he threw it Poston up and got it safely out of bounds unless you comes out of the huddle watch the left our doctor 60 Michael makes the tackle on me and it was Gotti who was doubting Russell Davis steal out of the locker room he said not only the hip pointer but he also hurt his ribs he feels he can't come back he simply wants to loose stuff on the sideline to find out the extent of the damage let's go back upstairs Thank You charlie Michigan's ball 245 first town trailing early in the second laughter by 34 Jon Kerley who got to him early Maple Valley Washington pretty pound on the 47 yard line of Michigan they have a second down eight they say faith after a 65 days browning browning the best for upfront I'll tell you can be a great fast pressure but if your linebackers to the outside and as they play college football their floaters after recognize run and past that time in pawn written recognize the basket browning a chance to catch up from the backside both the outside linebackers have done an excellent job when when lease has gone back to throw really creating a problem for that's Mars I'm going to tie it in an average receiver Dave Leitch now having a game can't get any time they drop back he lets it go there is just sitting the grasshoppers and eluded his fingertip again a higher caste was on leaf flip the failure the nose guard without after him and wrapped him up as he let the ball go all three defensive down linemen have put pressure on them for deadly when you do it that way all of you look good that's the way it's gone for Washington so far John Anderson of confirmation Nesby Glasgow the safety man he left the Pacific coast in punt returns this year averaging just over nine yards will occur on Brooklyn for touchdown calls for the first kiss and takes it on these 21 yard line Mexicans used to this the eighth time in 12 games this year they have played to over a hundred thousand families nothing Washington ahead their ball around 21 yard line early in the second period for Los Angeles Oh here and the secondary coverage I know it they've got about 12:15 on us we'll make the good fake in the live isolates linebacker and everybody's right it's trying to catch up Jim Pickens trying to catch up finally they dragged him down on a 17 yard line that is a 62yard pass from Warren Moon to his deep red spider game first down husky play give pickles a 50 man those fighters average 22 yards to catch God more on this one didn't take long to catch up to my Charlie there's no running mass there Jim Pickens comes back has to catch up help the Clyde Hicks not before a real big play way to go big underdog playing Michigan yes with behind rolling with the ball rolling the staff to the 10yard line he might have reached the nine nine and a half Ron Roland from Hayward California tipped by Ron Simpkins who has a chance to become the greatest linebacker in Michigan history he's just a sophomore he made more tackles this year that's the signal for the next play kind of complicated it is and I couldn't figure it out who seems to have it in perfect control panel I'm out on Washington go work out with us for 7,000 ft / 93 spider gains ran a 136 high hurdle in the track meet with the Soviet Union he's the best high of Hitler in the west coast and he could hurdle down that field under passes to it is purged out of tree watching of the 10 yard line mrs. Warren number 40 the sophomore linebacker destroyer who set the alltime record for the most tackles by a Michigan Player of the Year the impressive thing is that moon pit get outside Simpkins Hannah a whole lot of pursuit to catch up with Warren did it he was the only man in the area to make the play he made it coming in now Steve Robin is kicked 14 out of 20 to field goal Dwayne Akina second string quarterback the hole this will be a 30yard attempt it is that is please to test an underdog Muscatine from Seattle is now out of premieres Sunday Sports World January 22nd 2:30 Eastern Time they've got furling I've had a chance to hurling and motocross and I think you'll love it here was the kickoff this was the short one to the 11 Hicks back to the 20 Jeff Leyland again number 13 who is really covering on he kicks the punch today for washington when Rorick special are back said he had his group pumped up he meant it now Hicks has been a pirate earner all year long he's an excellent athlete he really has very little room to run the which kind of clogged up everything in front of him and Leyland put away the finishing touch we have 10 29 remaining here in the first half I should get the ball under 24 yard line there behind they gotta play catchup at least winning Hampton pushing out brought down on a 25 yard line by gun curly with a strolling outside linebacker why shouldn't a on those outside run that time it's later well well currently both Curley and Richardson when you have put them in a bind they haven't been able to continually beat them doing anything they'll give you a DAB here and a DAB there but they haven't allowed anyone to continually run one play on them I remember this Michigan squad me at the All Big Ten team five on offense Donahue downing Kim leaf and Russell Davis second down 980 pass out by number 46 Greg Ryan's a strong safety was a tenant for Russell Davis and are these Washington players sky higher you know it's impressive to maker that both the free Safety's for Washington play very cheap off the ball and yet force rather swiftly early in the game Heinrich was having a little trouble getting up but they play about 1213 yards deep however they don't take many steps backwards here's the call the quarterback doesn't like John 39 no I don't know a quarterback the likes and I meant for a third one let's see what leash does further nine 25 yard line they started this heart and the left axle was right there and Michael Jackson say doorway this is not a michigan specialty they haven't been 39 very often all year long Washington plate 15 pence forced them into a passing situation Bruce Harrell makes a fine play close in the hole the freakin offensive lineman joined in and they've got it stopped 40,000 Washington fans were here and they just say they're defensive crotch of standing ovations they went to the sideline Glassdoor the breakdown he gets it away wobbly kick class go on he's 36 for the 40 and down he goes there in the porting maybe short of the 40 he ran backwards number 52 number 99 up here the wind ginger and all the fields if they win tonight they should be the national champs probably Alabama's got an argument Notre Dame certainly throwing your chest down we know for home michigan's lost only one here dude there's a big drop getting a screen up system to the 45 history first down Ron Gibson now there's the master of the screen was John Brodie he knows all about it he could throw it as good as anybody watch it how deep they let those linemen come in well I don't know if I'm the mast occurred before when you get when you can allow your offensive linemen to go downfield on a screen pass actually any pass caught behind the line of scrimmage you can use a lot more screen so you notice he get Phil Foreman out in front of him right on wide Hicks puts him in a perfect position when he catches the ball pick up first man through is Ron Gibson we try to improve his blocking this year right now he's running well he picked up three yards to the 43 yard line in Michigan Carol he was nagged he's made some key tackles as an inside linebacker along with Michael Jackson some of the people he's hit or hurting a little bit to second to have seven Warren Moon that a quick fetch out breaking over the forty is rolling with a 38 Ron Roland who's having to go most of the way Joe steal the star tailback the sophomore was injured early in the game and Jerry meter an inside linebacker made that last half of a 38 yard line of Michigan it's third down and Washington put a balanced attack running screams long passes Kentucky help ERT replacing Tedesco flags are down Michigan may have been offside that one is batted away Steve graves made the charge offside against Michigan hey Rooney he's got him offbalance he long founded them again at a perfect time third down if three yards it's hard to pick up he got it the easy way watch it here and on this replay there he is 54 moving steam graves and offside and that gives Washington a first down there on the Michigan 34 yard line the Huskies on top 10 nothing the first quarter touchdown and a second period field goal moon I have an incomplete forward pass no intentionally grounding well I think put a call that just the way they could have fallen leeches past outofbounds intentional grounding there's no no doubt about the fact that he wanted to get rid of the ball and preserved the scrimmage line however it takes a good man to throw it close enough to a receiver who was Scott Greenwood on the play so the official won't call it second down ten I'm James putting clear the coasting of Washington he's brought them back with canned off the gifts in the pullback not much a couple of yards we're going to pause briefly for station identification this is the NBC television network this is KGW TV channel 8 in Portland Curt Goudy John Brodie Charlie Jones on the sidelines from the Rose Bowl and the score 10 nothing Washington just under 7 minutes to play in the first half stopping that gun will be 49 years Oh or he could go what they did is they got to slow Michigan's bro has is going to be very difficult for them to run against Michigan they got him going against the floor and made a super play looks like a clipping penalty I think power number 66 committed a clip let's check he's the ride guard pulling on watch it good playaction fake to Rolen he comes out you can see the flow of Michigan he's got Simpkins the whole defensive line penetrating gift trying to get into the act well that is not a clip they're not calling it at that point I think we see the clipon mic jolly so you look on another machine here John Gaines did a good job to get in all for not we'll take a look again is it Mike Jolly on Jeff caves on Mike Jolly he does he gets in the back turn hits him in the back all for naught but a beautiful looking play pays and what an exciting offense Lee performer that spider Gaines is he's caught two passes today 81 yard he just had a 31yard flank the reverse wiped out the score spider games coming out wide to the left ball was put back on the yard line and on third and 11 the path will complete the game I guess if they say hey fingers peteandjayne start 13 more is just a junior everyone mooners throne has been either to an intended recipient the money when he's had his man open or he's thrown it in a safe spot this warren moon went to washington herald has an outstanding passer he was not his first year or two this year he's hit 57 percent of the passes 11 touchdown after boom because five steps before he hands the ball off his roll this is the effect of a trough play it looks like it's going to be a rollout fast action hands the ball rolling he catches missing michigan's lines with linebackers in pursuit portion pick information stop playing washer Russia got 11 the leading 10nothing tearing Michigan apart with a combination of everything hitting here hitting there go to the 5 stop light hits the Wolfman the Wolfman in that backfield secondary means he could be anywhere he wants but it better be around the ball or he won't be the Wolfman that's right I'll tell you though when you've got to match up a guy like Gibson at 200 1819 fans against 185pound man I think Hicks better get a good start there's Washington team coached by Don James averaged 28 points a game Michigan averaged 30 again Gibson again they want power they give it to the 218 found Gibson he's hit by symptoms number 40 and Sebring number 91 James is a very lowkey man he claims that if I ever coach I was never going to scream at my players I didn't want to be screamed at or yelled at and I would never do it myself pretty simple thought I think it's a very effective on a three yard line down a yard ago for a first down at home Warren Moon fake the handoff Kanako it looks like he has the first though good their approach to go or moving on sits down the Flynn says borrowing about the halfyard line going out as P power the right guard okay he's in a rare situation if this was third and goal I imagine they'd have to go to the air to cry and thick enough he's only got a yard for a first down however blooms a pretty crafty kid he figures he can pick it up on his own and he does first and goal to go Washington a half yard line in Michigan Pickens it out Michael Harmon is coming in Scott Greenwood and Rudy moraga another tight end or in the lineup for blocking foul Mike care go back has come in and Steve raises out at noseguard Michigan already trailing ten nothing now take them Gibson's they file him up Ron gifted his pile up at the goal line he's not in there number 42 second down I'll flip the goal or a Washington touchdown so many people say it's anybody can pick up a foot but when you're playing against the team like Michigan who was dug in made it very difficult for people to make more than a yard in this sort of situation all year long it is no gimme Washington is driven 61 yards they have completely dominated a second quarter to the wideopen stuff Gibson nearly moved or moon the dust down he's going off a little bit of shock into Michigan I'm sure the last thought they ever had is that Washington would beat them in the air they've tried to all day they can really do some damage on the ground moon flipped it over well he can run he could roll out he could throw on the run and he's throwing very well today he could get outside he could hit inside great allpurpose quarterback moonlights up their life here in Washington and that gift is good and this is a red Washington team touchdown underdog they're pouring on Michigan time out with a score season 17 and Michigan epic now here's another Goodyear blimps I have you she circled the Rose Bowl to bring you these exciting aerial shots Washington and Michigan go at it and going at it Michigan's really going to have to go at it now three and a half to play in the first half they have been stunned and almost bewildered here in his second period the kickoff coming to Clayton at the 1 he's a from appointee he brings it back to the 30 yard line downfield Wayne Roach a free safety look at that drive which the yards 13 play here they're past run ball back foot again motion Becker was hitting his fly goes the screen and that's Roosevelt Smith and he's out of bounds you get out by flip affair and Bruce harreld Michigan style is usually a great defensive team they've led the nation in defense the last five years in allowing the fewest points and then a grind amount offense that controls the game when they fall behind they've had problem and I think Curt the reason that many people thought they would be much more effective this year as it leaches come on and thrown the ball well when he's had to I had added another dimension to their ballclub all year long after got a new coach John Newland the work the leash on the passing game ii am seven breaking over is Russell Davis and that's a big game point Davis to the 4080 problems mark okay they still got 33 minutes they're only 17 points down it's quite a whole lot more than that in one quarter mark 9 used here lead lead to play it's really after the offensive lineman to take control of the game for Michigan they've been beaten Washington has controlled both lines of scrimmage this is a good breaking play by Davis they need a lot more of Davis has 47yard he's deleting ballcarrier in his game beyond the 47 and are helping a Washington Clara and that's Bruce harreld in Seattle Washington a sophomore he was shaken up earlier he's a little more and shaken up this time it's been a very instrumental part of their defensive play batball again Notre Dame 38 Texas 10 a final Oklahoma and Arkansas will follow this one Oklahoma's there many fans ready to claim a national title Alabama Notre Dame Michigan fans you have an elite group down here in this last day of the season of the college season with 10 and 11 1 record I think everybody's playing the Curt I've never seen anybody after they scored a touchdown run off and put three fingers in the air number one 3000 all right seconds on seven Michigan in Washington Territory into Washington 49 Gunja finish the structure at the line of a slant pattern antennas for Ralph Clayton number 22 Willig Aloha number 35 deflected it and there's the injured linebacker his need number 55 Bruce harreld and the low has a guy that just replaced him it is now a third down seven to go Michigan on the Washington 49 yard line six of these Washington defensive backs from the state of California the SWAT left roughly but they are getting good the flag down with the fair 67 got to him he was knocked down and it's ramping a facemask they grab the facemask on this one well he's been in there so often and he's given downing all he can handle today as you recall he's not playing Molly putts downing is the consensus allamerican this year but they are showing him that hey you're not going to have an easy day in the park they've tried to handle him with three men the fourth guy he gets to his leach makes a mistake grabs the facemask that's the way it goes he's still doing a heck of a job now they'll walk off the penalty will give Michigan a first down and they need a score badly before the end of this half with just over two minutes to play in the half it is Washington 17 and Michigan nothing the facemask penalty 15yard gives Michigan the ball on the Washington 34 Michigan's passing attack has had problems today in leaps getting the time he has had a hard pass running nearly every time back first out first man through is Russell Davis two yards to the 32 hit by cliff aphaia and Doug Martin I'm James sent four of his assistant coaches to this man spring training this year spring practice with a great admirer chef hecklers the one of the study is procedures I don't think he was gotten them I do believe your friend learned some Ronnie let's go it's the Russell Davis the lease is running backwards a Roy Riegel's run out of that one he's got nowhere to go he hasn't been able to get anybody open downfield yeah as a primary receiver by the time he comes off to a secondary receiver he's got somebody sitting in his face and he just hasn't been able to execute Oklahoma Arkansas standing by at the Orange Bowl and we'll switch right from Pasadena to Miami for the Orange Bowl on NBC 3rd down 8 Michigan on to Washington 32:17 reppin Washington I'm in a 35 to go in the half all of them are coming up with a big play ultimately they've control the line of scrimmage except for a few specific instances you've got the credit blip play it's not the falls of Michigan offensively I'm not sure they played anybody of this caliber all year long on this given day and the Washington defense John was supposed to be pushed around yeah not so I know a lot of good teams have tried to do so SC being one of them they forgot to do it Jim Becker is unhappy look at him on outside line he is steaming watched him under 30 yard line moon fires and it is incomplete the spider gain gains at 30 catches this year six touchdown 22 yards to catch it in this game he's averaging a little over 31 yards a catch and he doesn't do too poorly when you give him a reverse you know Mon has been it's been stated by so many people who have scouted Washington the moon throws the ball better running to his left in his right I've never seen that but every indication I've seen today felt was right improve running after this year to second down they're not holding on to the ball he fires it away at the 30 and dropped at the 33 yard line as the tailback Ron roller Saturday January 7th preceding coverage of round three of the Joe Garagiola Tucson open we're going to have a 29th renewal of the Senior Bowl and they have invited some outstanding players we'll be telling you about here's moving on he's roll out my hands are rolling we got down there Earl Campbell a Grambling quarterback Doug Williams outstanding player at eastwest game Oklahoma State running back Terry Miller their runnerup for the Heisman Trophy guy Benjamin that's Brody's boy I think anybody have watched him a few days ago might agree he threw three touchdown passes against LSU the other day Ozzie Newsome of Alabama they have some outstanding players the Senior Bowl january 7th on NBC confirmation the photo the sevenpoint lead was not sitting US that's a good thought wide hips before the car Oh it surprised me I surprised everybody just a little push past nobody in the area Todd Stevens gets it he's got no one down there to handle they're not satisfied they've got good reason not to be John this reminds me of the fake punt that Stanford ran against Michigan in the 1972 only they ran the ball that time Washington through this and they're ahead 17 to nothing and they want more twirl will premiere on January 22nd if it's his wildest Washington football team is there in the second period you're going to see some real acting it's pretty wild there premiere on Sunday January 22nd I have never seen a team more wide open in one period of play that Washington has been in this 1978 Rose Bowl game they have done everything you can do out there offensive though first down Warren Moon goes out and it complete with a 15yard line to the tight end stop Greenwood he's out of bounds in the clock to stop for 39 seconds and a half Washington leading 70 no Kurt these plays are so deceptive now if you recall the same playaction was done and they gave the ball to roll in on a draw flight he made the same fake at the same time actually greenwood didn't get way open but open enough on second down moon scampering away goes on the road that's why faster than tenifer games at number 16 mike jolly was there to nearly pick it off now the clock is stopped with 32 seconds to go and 1/2 and 1/3 down 6 for the University of Washington they haven't been here 14 years they're making up for the lack of being here the way they're playing in this first hand they're here now Warren Moon and third down that's right here and Hicks is driven out of our Warren Moon as he let the ball go his arm was it fixed intercepts the pass intended for Scott Greenwood well Warren Moon I do think got his arm hit however he was throw into a man that said actually quite Hicks was in perfect position to cover he had already taken away the area from him caught it on a dead run made a big play out of it so it looks like we're going to go into halftime just as if they'd punted that'll be Michigan the ball first down under 33 twentyfour seconds in the half white Hicks two years of safety man now the Wolfman linebacker all big 10 gladly Fitchburg wide receiver he can run him deep rich leash go over the short when completes at the David Davis has dropped down on his 47 yard line 15 seconds to go Michigan signals for a timeout Greg Bryan made that tackle these two teams are playing as if they're 15 seconds left in the game rick leach talking to Bo Schembechler you know bo has adamantly stated several times that Rick leach is a fine thrower his stats really do indicate that this year he's come on from being a fine athlete to an outstanding quarterback I look for a lot more football out of him in the second half I'm sure they're just discussing how they possibly can get that ball down the field and 15 seconds to put them in a position for a field goal tighten this thing up so it's only two touchdown difference you see leashes helmet many colleges do this they award stars or it might be the symbol of a team little Wolverine and for being voted for outstanding defense he plays offense he plays something outstanding in a game they put him on a helmet now this is leaches third year and as I told you he already holds more records than any man in the history of Michigan football is how much gonna be pulled before he walked out of there he may have to wear two helmets next year Allen Mitchell of wide receivers in first down Michigan they're 47 7 two points behind 73 Martin the f\u00e1\u00e1\u00e1 and browning have been brilliant as a three down linemen flanked by two standup linebackers I get the feeling that Washington is just down here having a ball I don't know what they've been doing in preparation for this game but you see all their defensive linemen are getting good penetration you see browning forcing the play he forces leach out of the pocket but there he can't go up front Martin comes in from behind his block and makes a big play and you know John the outstanding Featured the Michigan team is their veteran offensive line they have four seniors in there and a junior and three allamerican and where they were supposed to have a big advantage today they would be able to control the running game because of that interior line and move Washington out they figure Washington not Michigan's coaching staff but many fans figured the Washington will be easy to move out of there I think browning but pea and and Martin forgot to read that news second down 15 nine seconds to go in the half Michigan has been blank here's the bomb beach the Clayton way over his head three seconds to go Ralph Clayton the top receiver in the Michigan team with 19 catches Carl Heinrich 96 Nesby Glasgow 23 we're back you never know about a senior ballclub but this is going to be a senior junior ballclub next year this Washington team only four seniors on the starting team of offense and defense and Don James the coach told me the other day said look we're a year early I'll take it you've been we're pointing for next year you've been he's got the quality to take a look at a football player make judgment let the guy prove him right I think he has more confidence in his players in most any coach I've ever seen there are several outstanding ones but he certainly exposes his quality this should be the last play of the first half leaches back as time runs out now he throws it completes at the Clayton he'll have to contain Clayton and a half's is over big big trouble early in this second half Stevens down to five back to the 15 in the 20 finds the crack and plows forward and goes down on the 28 yard line Kyle Stephens washed him for the first down and looks like Joe Steele is going to open up that tailback he is the starting tailback there he is 24 Warren Moon will be a quarterback number one and right now he is a oddson favorite to be the player of this game will he play there's 30 minutes left if they had a vote after the first half there's no doubt the fullback is Gibson 42 the tailback of Steel 24 in motion they give the ball the Gibson on a quick hitter and he's piled up for a yard or two Ron Gibson that's the tenth carry for Ron Gibson bought the ball in a 31 yard line of the Huskies second down eight their line the Westland Foreman Bush Bush has been brilliant today at center power the right guard pays the right tackle spider games of course rigs the wide receivers now Richardson's in there instead of Ric motivation he kissed it and he had to eat the ball as take a lot Ron Simpson got to him number 40 it's a good play Curt it's you know when you go in at halftime you have in a Rose Bowl game 25 minutes to discuss strategically what you want to do to stop what the other team has been doing well now you know Michigan is not going to employ the same toys because they did in the first half they will make a few subtle changes that was one of them they had Simpkins right in the line of fire moon did the right thing and ate the ball third and 12 Washington on our 26 Richardson going in motion moon throwing a rope and Michigan Mike jolly has it and Michigan has the ball deep in Washington Territory fighter game genna's receiver interception and move through the ball right well you saw joy at the end of the first half Dwight Hicks came up and made a real big play on bald took away in the offensive receiver's pattern this is the same sort of situation different man and jolly but he comes in and takes the position away the same patterns being fought better defense being implemented you can see the whole Michigan team rallying around him after catching the ball gage brings him down before he gets to the 12 yard line all right an early mistake Michigan anxious take advantage crashing through is Russell Davis he's been the main ball career today he's hit by Dave browning and is the untangle we pause briefly for identification this is the NBC television network this is KGW TV channel 8 Portland Curt Goudy John Brodie Charlie Jones in the Rose Bowl Michigan has the ball on the Washington nine Washington's leading seventeen nothing mr. tailback hit fire to those guard flip the stay up and Dave browning right on the fiveyard line of Washington third down three to go that's Don James with a cap the hip set his team during a 17 point lead has made a costly mistake maybe early in the second half mistake but agree like and hurt some people start talking he did the right thing he called a timeout that's what should been falling that situation this is a crucial plateform current they've got three yards for a first down five for a touchdown I think if they get down to where they've only got a yard or left foot for a first down they'll go for it on fourth most of the Washington crowd is on the goal line on the far side of the field 40,000 there and now the watch and players are asking their fans come on let him call the signal third down and three there goes week laceless top maybe short of the first down by antlion Richardson and will eat glue lahu it's short but now what do they do they got about a yard to go to for a first and 3/4 touchdown I think you'll see them go for it there are the three yard line war found and a yard to go for Michigan Davis the fullback least the portable closed off this is the tailback no flags are down as I can watch out but we are the nose in there 67 I did not see flags drop looked like the jump outside when they got back again captain's can bite you what happens is they jump back in time it throws you offensive offensive linemen a little off scene they get in the middle of the problem stop each of the six yard line for Dale pace the left tackle cookie Mary one of the outstanding men in his field today has been the nose guard number 67 cliff Isaiah for the University of Washington all three of those guys have just played so far beyond their expectations other people's expectations probably very close to their own tightened down seven of the Huskies come up they've had two turnovers today on intersection makes again one on a fumble moon one get out and is not done on the 9 yard line he was going to throw the ball he wanted to I they may have to give him a saliva test but when I tell you the guy had such confidence in himself it's possibly a good reason they're ahead 17 to nothing right now the burden is on Michigan's defensive line they've been great all year long they're in a position where they can really help their whole team now that's up to them to dig in Warren Moon has had only one pass intercepted out of every twenty eight this year he's had two intercepted in this game a timeout by Washington and they were mixed up on a play they're sending those hand signals plays in and Moon couldn't fathom just what they wanted to call though he stepped in and asked for a timeout and with the timeout the score again Washington 17 Saturday January the Joe Garagiola Tucson open this is the first event on a PGA schedule they had a thriller last you Bruce Lipsky winning will tell you more about it and the Tucson open right now it's third down and three don't feel handed off the seal described through steel is brought down by Jerry meter and Jim chicken now here's a chance for Michigan's defensive line who has been outplayed throughout this ball game to really pick up and help their whole club you see why they want to have Joe steel back in the game it's the same sort of roll out draw play they used effectively in the first half he picked up about 12 big ones in the first down hey strong 201 found he says he runs pigeontoed bowlegged doesn't matter he seems to go forward that's Richardson emotion first down watch him under 20 to steal again yes I did it go somewhere and then he was mapped is that there by Ron Simpkins I'll tell you the offensive offensive line for Washington's done an outstanding job perfect indication you see Phil Foreman pulling you see Gibson coming in to help out save they create a hole about five yards wide and that's what a running back love let them down or the go Washington best drug of their 28 ruin a quick pass touchdown in the Clair your Dwight Hicks the ball was throwing hard and high he dashed in there he's the wolf man and he had clear sailing to the goal line he's going to hold on he's playing situations Kurt very well you saw him pick one off at the end of the first half he was on that ball the whole way while moon was looking to the right side he was already moving into position almost picked it off in the dead run Washington's already thrown an interception deep in their own territory in this period and nearly had another one there there have 17 nothing 8:25 to go in the third period moon out of gold this complete to stop green with the guy down and he's brought down by Jerry meter 46 and that will be a Washington first down this is more than Washington has thrown the ball all year long particularly on first and second downs they know it's extremely difficult to penetrate the defense of Michigan can consistently they've done it both on top and on the ground and you get the feeling you don't know what's coming next all right the Huskies setup berth down under 35 for the 38 yard line by Lauren Simpson and what a sophomore linebacker he is there's the equivalent on the other side Jacqueline Michael Jackson number five he's a junior three times this year voted the pack eight Defensive Player of the Week and twice nationally won the top defensive honor and he's trying to keep his group pumped up he knows this ball game is still in the Hat and a long way from over second down 7 for watching so feel a demotion here the rollout pattern moon keeps the ball and is dragged down on his 41 yard line turning upfield what he has that sprint out batter he has the option to throw the ball or run it much like the old single wing tailback John you've been and he's not going very gee you know so he's shinik fed under a little more often than he would if he were rolling a bit deeper speed graves is really putting the burden for is on him like a blanket that got away from Cory and made the only tackle that was available but this was a nifty Drive for the Washington fan our team started on the three nothing today the boys history hurts tomorrow but today it's Satterfield fine they're giving him all of Running Room a bat can possibly ask for put hand off the Gibson underneath here comes Foreman out again Bush cutting off when he can stay stay from moving people out on inside of the line and steals picked up big yardage three times for the right wash you the now on Michigan's 39 yard line first down living blessed he has one thing I like to see in the back he's always leaning forward going for that xray arty okay he's got one a backpacks to see if that's a hole the last three times is off the hips advantages flowing people out of there he's picking up agent and crack those defensive backs and all the work they can handle right now second down a yard ago line blasting away at Michigan Joe steel running brilliantly is in motion second out a yard to go quick buck through by Ron Gibson and he should have the first down inside the Michigan 32 the Michigan 28 yard line what a drive by the Husky there on Michigan 28 we're talking about that Tucson open that was a thriller you had last year wasn't it John tell you when you watch let's keyhole it from about 95 feet as Jean Lee was preparing to he got a win with a 12foot Verdi it could be the same again this year who pull back in the game Mullen goes deep come up with a big play when it's been needed John Huston's and caught six passage 454 take a look down at a college downplay Isaiah Washington is in total control when he goes back to throw the ball he's got two in three steps you can get the ball away and complete it that way he did the spider food for 23 to nothing for when leash goes back to throw he's got the defensive front for watching all over him and that is really the story of the ball game 97 yards Washington stop Michigan on her three and then took it the rest of the way is coming to Clayton Clayton out to the 10:20 Lane wrote made the tackle let's go down to Charlie John Kurt the Roseville crowd was hunt you know what it was it ended up it's a straight elbow for spider problem to cramp in my leg we're hoping crap okay spider let's go upstairs I'll tell you something spider a few other people got cramps in their leg to the thumb the other side when they're trying to run you down one of the credible average he's had over 30 yards of test today all right Michigan comes right back Stanley Edwards the freshman tailback grinder reached the 25yard line is short they're stopped by pasea and de loja you won't see a better drive than that 97 yards against one of the best teams in the country and they just have Michigan off balance Michigan doesn't know where they're going to run inside outside or fast Tim Beckman looking at the clock frustrated has been able to win a postseason game put it on the see this as you can see here we go they're trying to get back in the ball game is far from over yet see Dustin just runs by the defensive quarterback Heinrich's coming over trying to catch him Brian's is on the run it's all futile 76 yards is a long way to go but he makes it Kurt Stevenson was a walkon did not come in with a scholarship all right let's see what they do here 24 6 and the kick is up big plays like that kicking off will be Greg Wilden Barkley and Kyle Stephenson will be backed up the story of the Wolverines scoring drive Kurt Stephenson a California boy has scored the touchdown for Michigan coming to Stephens on the free he's after the 15 to the 20 the hotties have had a lot of times when they could have concerned themselves with becoming conservative they're they're blocking up front is just miraculous the whole wedge this time creates the whole Stephens gets the ball he just picks the hole he's got it he gets a little bump along the way and he's out in the open and this is a 53yard return by Kyle Stephen Washington's ball in the Michigan 44 I pricked his back in the game Gary Briggs that's Joe Steele east of the 39 yard line he's a slashing type runner Michie is that paper Roger Westland Phil Foreman Blair Bush these guys continue to push Michigan's defensive line back second down five piloting the 192 foot blimp today is Nick Nick Allari who hails from Los Angeles over the 35 to the 34 is Ron Gibson they run him mostly inside the tackles although he has the speed to get outside now Owens the inside linebacker made the tackle on him they're going to measure they've asked for this picks with 343 to play in the third quarter Notre Dame knocked off Texas today 38 210 alabama won handily over Ohio State thirty five to six coming up next the Orange Bowl boys are Oklahoma and Arkansas two teams each lost only one game that detector I don't believe you'll see a slippery team and football in entire Oklahoma squad push down Washington 34 yard line and misses that's quick handoff again the rod Gibson and that time is hit by Curtis Grier the right tackle Washington's got a little more conservative man Don James talking upstairs of one of his assistant coaches it's on the 30yard line in Michigan conservative stay conservative maybe but no less aggressive they're moving the ball on the ground there's no reason to stop fighter Gaines flag left Gary Briggs to the right moving on a roll our Saturn throws the ball conclusive it'll be a first down Scott Greenwood Paul the three men that get him out of our why hits Jim Pickens Ronnie now while they line them up yardsticks water in mind you the Bob Hope allstar tribute to the Palace Theater will be Sunday January 8 to 9:30 Eastern Time I guess Sammy Davis jr. George birth the see Laurent et gourmet at Carole law on NBC's Sunday January 8 first down first team yard line Washington Asif steel and steel getting off his right tackle to the manga Atlanta Michigan where he was taken by Derrick hard and mellow even though it looked as if he was hit at the line of scrimmage he still picked up about four yards Kurtz he just has that momentum going forward all the time and the reason he's got it again I hate to overplay it but it's just it's the story of the ball game his offensive line keeps knocking people out of the what should I have with a 6yard line is run gets it on that quick hitter it hasn't looked like much but it's been effective three or four yards on the tackle Jim Pickens the safety man they have third down to tight is Rudy Morita Scott Greenwood in the lineup now for watching where in the last two minutes of play of a third period the score twenty four to seven Washington they OMSI who was trying to come out from behind the center maybe to run a roll out or hand off on a dive tackle playing bail kites 55minute judge charger here we go this is the way you have to make plays in order to penetrate a team like Washington on the right side their offensive line is doing a fine job the deal kites gets in between two blockers and pulls moon down before the play can get started moon was going to hand off Johnny very wisely pull that ball back in again if he tried to hand off an impact he would have followed a field goal attempt by Siro this will be a 27 yard attack the kick is up pad their lead by three more points we're in the last 50 seconds now the first period Washington 27 at Michigan 7 dynamic Jules that's premiere January 27 going to be hosted by John Brodie so let's have him tell us all about well I say if you'd like to see Arnold Palmer with the oxygen levels very low with Raymond Floyd I think one of the best money players in the game of golf trying to trying to compete with with an Eddie Arcaro and a Willie shoemaker and Jim Brown Jim Taylor I think you're going to enjoy it they have 15 minutes 44 seconds to put on a furious rally the happy gang down there and that Huckabay Brickley sets him down that's the freshman Stanley Edwards and he stopped at the 26 let me repeat again at Harlan Huckabee a star tailback and a wouldbe starter here today did not even suit up because of a full hamstring muffin we've had one of those our block here on a 26yard line in Michigan they have a second down and four curtain March playful throw complete the leading receiver on the food and they have a first down of their 45 yard line now Heinrich at Landstuhl Dale taking to stop in the 45 yard line Clayton me to find route their clarity you went down kind of under control just kind of cut through the defensive line backers and least put it right on the money that's an swine Richardson who was injured right now the outside linebacker they're helping him up go off the field with one second you know the Big Ten Conference the pack eight and the Tournament of Roses announced this week an allocation of ten thousand dollars for the rehabilitation of the Evansville college basketball program and these three by the way gave $10,000 in 1971 the marshal and Wichita State in the air tragedy involving their football team that is the end of the third quarter the end of the third quarter in the Rose Bowl Washington 27 pretty good seven well into that last quarter I wonder who'll be voted the outstanding player in the game last year was quarterback Vince Evans with Southern Cal John Shara UCLA the year before half to 1875 John McCain the great pains that won the award leaked out of the pocket goes down on the 49yard line a Michigan hit by clipless a again who hasn't been some player out there the nose guard now this time leach had plenty of time to throw but the defensive secondary wasn't in the mood to give him anybody open now you see the respect that they've gained for Bethesda ball game has gone on he's standing out there we've got Donahue Walt downing this time he handles him by himself but you can see Donahue standing around picking up everybody's got their attention on number 67 complete at the 44yard line of washington for a first bound Glasgow drove rich white to split in 84 out of bound and oh you mark it down there's Ward Mooney baby a strong candidate today for player of the game how about some of these other men hojae's tips of 168 jim plunkett 71 Sam Cunningham 73 the only man ever win the award twice what a story he was will tell you about it a minute first down Michigan under Washington 44 they'll throw it in flares it out go to the 40 to the 35 and down in the 34th family Edwards the freshman hit by Michael Jackson number 5 and that may be another Michigan first down Jim Becker watching the clock listening at the same time sending subs into the game a desperate situation for his team they're going to measure well they do the only man to ever win the Player Award twice in this game was a oneeyed quarterback named bob schloredt of the university of washington he won it in 1960 and 1961 his short by a foot five Loretta grace story up there of Seattle brought his team in here and let them the two victories 105 312 is the official state attendance today 1:05 three flowers family edward has the first down to the 31 yard line of watches Mexican Kurt you don't notice Michigan's moving the ball very well now they had a 76yard touchdown Stephenson they only had the ball in the third quarter for a little bit over four minutes now Washington's offenses the thing was pretty dictated even though Michigan can move the ball offensively they have to get the ball back in order to score first down for the Wolverines inside the 20 is knocked down to the 19 by Kyle Hinrich the free safety number 96 this was a type of running game that everyone thought Michigan would display it in that Washington can almost afford to allow Michigan dues to persist by remaining in the game 2077 Washington the first 20 to the 15 his round plate the wing back and he gets down to the 13 yard line where he was tackled by duck Martin the left tackle of Washington where they'd just you know doesn't complete with the baby first and Grover's old Michigan now got the two yard line great grind drop Russell Davis who's been a leading ball carrier in the game Davis on the ground has 64 yard check that steel has 73 and steel has played very little in this game I think the effective thing right there was the way Rick leach went out looking for Stephenson in the corner of the end zone he was well covered he came back to his secondary receiver Davis right away and put the ball exactly where it had to be thrown first and goal to go leaks now 9 out of 15 Wolverines on the Husky yard line Washington's been doing a great job at defense in the search at the end of the third quarter and in this quarter particularly the drive to Michigan put together this one was outstanding this is what people have been accustomed to watching Michigan do they just capital with that little oneyard jump and the kick by Greg Wilner is good timeout Michigan still hustling score Washington 27 Michigan 14 or will they kick a deeper then thanks on our defense the hole they're gonna kick it high coming to Kyle Stephen equiping cuddly flag has been dropped Washington has unloaded everything today in a offensive arsenal you've good they have pulled out all stops Kurt they know that's a very dangerous play down there there's only one way you can get the ball inside your 10yard line that's on a revert just as it gets performed they're trying to set up a wall game can't get to it you can see they give it to games he's had everything going his way the first time is Jim Pickens gets picked off however he is not the man and my collie brings him down time remaining 1113 Michigan alaclaire forced that mistake room the Jo seal he'll come back to the 7 yard line where he was stopped by his Jim Pickens and Derrick Howard Washington had the ball one time on her free up you know we're sitting up there thinking hey maybe this you never know it's down there they've shown no indication trying to hold on maybe trying to increase it this question of focus Club get the first down on this play Merlin pick jarick Howard came up and stopped that play all the way and Dwight hit for the safety man and when Michigan just a ball back again they're going to be a good field position with a little over nine minutes to do something not over yet there's a pun nice floating to hitch to the 50 45 and down in a 44 yard line Michigan has the ball in Washington Territory from fourth quarter club all year saravana wise for 44 late Johnny Cooper white leafs got away from about three onrushing lineman Lance total made the tackle Emirates white the play after all that scrambling picked up the yard well Rick white is a wide receiver he went down the field 12 a 13 yard did the wise thing had Rick not been able to find what he'd have been dropped for about 18 yard loss that's the sign of a good receiver even though it picked up a yard third statement subjection of the Michigan huddle Lakes on the pitch out number 34 today you think he's not pumped up both he and Richardson the two outside linebackers from Washington have a big job in front of him but they force him to pitch when he does he's got flipped for food fights Doc Martin Curley standing out there to turn it in and four or five other fellows are waiting to see what happened all right a third of 19 and you go all out and rushing Pardee a rush Freeman and drop back and look for the deeper offensively you're going to put that thing up in the air I believe that's very predictable they've done pretty well with Freeman I don't think they're going to bliss they're not Lakes is firing deep that ball a fourth John Anderson Neil glass for the safety man watch out here watch him fake the fund earlier and ran her pass for a first down Lawson hi fair catch call and it's skipping in for the touchback will be Washington fall first down on their 20 no flags are down there the time up the score why for the 27th and Michigan's 14th confront 513 every year the victim team comes in as a flavor and has done out of here it's been a reversal at forum and we'll talk about that on first down the pitch goes Corolla grow under being chased out of bounds for a loss on the 1812 for the first 13 games between the big 10 and the pack 8 conference were worn by the big 10 I don't mean only one I mean one handily and many people thought the theme Pacific Coast garbage to get out of the agreement and then matters turned around and now it's gone the other way is to pack a twinning and has either been Ohio State or Michigan out here force and they go through a tease or own conference and then doesn't see no matter who they're playing here they run in a real problem there's a screen pass they stop there the first time we'll get back into the rest of that spot in the second third but theta he has played seven game at little guard and a standout for watching that was intended for Greenwood on third or one he fired that ball it nearly went into Mike Jolly's arms for an interception but a matter who's here from this conference they have shown a wellbalanced team wide open and passing and running well it's my opinion that carry fifties up odds are made by people who expect third things without taking into consideration the strength of the respective conferences I don't think this is an upset that's taking place and I think we alluded to that in the first of the program and the game is not over either I expected a close game there's still a good chance it's going to be one that sixpoint down to a 30yard line so a Michigan have the ball with six 19 to go Ohio State was handle easily today by Alabama 35 six so when this afternoon is over it is not going to be a joyful day for the Big Ten unless Michigan could put on a miracle rally in the last six 19 of this ballgame now here is your score with a timeout Washington 27 Michigan 14 it had to be a perfect throw to get there and it was on July 1st Arizona State at Arizona go into this conference in the West it will be called the Pacific ten or the pac10 conference both those teams will be eligible for the Rose Bowl next year weeks at 11:45 and of the forty this outstanding junior still has another year Doug Martin made the tackle on him the clock is moving down to five minutes away Wolverines on the Washington 15 Arizona State will bring it a good football program and so little arrows going to you it seems to be of the same type to their high school and football things with a lot of lot of frankerz and running backs and they're tough to stop they must play seven Conference opponents to fortify butter oil and they will wait the bomb the Clayton over his head and complete covered by Nesbit Glasgow the jr. of Lynwood California oftentimes you'll see a theme Scout another team and they must have had the feeling coming into today's game that they could beat Glasgow deep they've tried it four times they've been unsuccessful on each occasion and I think in blasco's defense he's also covered the wide receivers tight when they go and look in toward the middle the ball on the 50yard line the Wolverines desperate now third down on the yard to go 38 seconds to play breaking through to the 45 of Washington is Russell Davis now the move the yard is down as soon as they plan him and set him up again Greg Grimes in that last tackle Jim Becker still urging his team on I look up at the clock and it's starting again four and a half minutes ago he's urging him on like quicker guys quicker lasgo makes the catch again on plate to see the clock four minutes to play Michigan on the mark the option play family Edward depression taken out by John curly and Bruce Harold it was between a fire the leech has really brought them back in this the defense discovered has been fine in defense Russia still forced him out of the pocket on several occasions fascinating one in particular he found the receiver he's hit him and he's brought him back in the ballgame what he's 7 to 20 now the point they've got to go 42 time I have two ball slips through his hand a little bit as the kicker goes up he sees it's not down it's a little too late to go back and start over never didn't get above the heads of the lineman team late in the third quarter in that game this one's exciting enough for me pal Val Stephens is growing it down it for the touchback Michigan had this full complement of timeout Washington asked to left ball will be brought out to the 20yard line first down for Washington and what looked like a breeze in Michigan is hung in has come back now in sport to success he touchdown up to their defense now and it's up to Washington to keep the ball and move it that last drive 70 yards a plays two turnovers against Washington won again gives them all or on Gipson Joe steel is injured will not be back Jared meter the linebacker stopping just over three minutes to play moon throws down there 220 they stepped out of the bring it back Jim pickin chasing him they were playing one it amused about a thousand others too though Redwing catch here you go and you see they know the position they're in they've got to pick up a first hand he puts the ball out to the left side right by the side line on the money and we see the foot slide out of bounds and the play is dead by the 25yard line a lot of fans are going to be asking pasta to be passing into the flat isn't that too dangerous it isn't if you don't have somebody real close covered five he's going to throw again and this one is incomplete number 81 every brick they had a third in one situation and passed the fist on it that had to cut Michigan came back and score all right this is the freshman a fair catch is called by hips on the 37 hi I'm remaining 256 watch that look to be safely in the Rose Bowl hey that kick went about forty three or four yards he had to kick minute the kick is coming to Nick's at the 40 the 42 yard line it'll be michigan's ball first down on their 42 time remaining two minutes 46 seconds and the game now is tightened there it is 27:20 he's Michigan fans with awaken here now in the last five minutes but Leach has put the ball the only place is going to be thrown Lance left Odell has him covered like a blanket watch him go down feel his way in the middle of the field in between the linebackers now if we throw it the ball on the other side doesn't force Clayton to come back as an incompletion or an interception who says Rick leash catch pass to bring him back he's certainly done that there goes Davis we're down the 215 the play Michigan trailing 2720 has made a furious comeback here late in the fourth quarter and has all been in the last half of the fourth quarter look at Jane he hasn't changed expression the opening kickoff the yard to go the option family Edwards of freshmen who scored the last fishing a touchdown in the past is knocked out of bounds by Nesbitt Glasgow first down he's humping their club in himself he's doing it all just the same way Warren Moon did the first two and a half quarter he's brought them back awfully tough playing away from home to get into a position where you're down by 20 point rally your clothes to wear with a minute and a half left to play you've got a chance to get them in and kick a twopointer and win the football game you see Edwards come out helping block he gets it out of bounds they've still got a minute he picked up eight yards on her feet leaked flipping deepen in dog three tough ones in this fourth period they felt this that path was well thrown lease puts the ball over the secondary over the secondary man in this case it was Lance Codell it's Clayton's job to get to it he played the ball perfectly gave himself the only chance to get it Samaritan he didn't hold on Jim Becker knows his team must get a first down there 32 late bleep gonna throw go there is still a minute 21 seconds to go Michael Jackson finally shows a little emotion well don't think it hasn't been going on in Rick leach comes back with a playaction pass I actually thought the receiver has the ball it puts it down just to the outside shoulder it looks as if Stanley Edwards has the ball it gets caught on the top of his helmet Jackson washing the ball comes in takes it away from the back shoulder and that is the miraculous interception he led the Washington team an interception and in deflected passes next year in preseason hurl here it is again and listen Edwards might have taken that ball run right to the flag and gone in with it he has that kind of speed",

  "transcript": "good afternoon once again everybody I'm Steve Bassett along with Bob row it is cold in Lincoln Nebraska it's getting colder we're already around 40 degrees they're expecting the temperature to drop during the game to somewhere in the mid 20s what kind of what effect is that's gonna have on these guys oh we got here this morning a little bit earlier I thought it'd be a beautiful day I was liking the 50 I thought you know it's gonna be a super day for me gonna go out super football weather go out play a whale of a ballgame I just got cold in the Dickens I mean it just it's gone but the innocent could have change the tough passing strategy will brief would we see a big ground game today well there's one heck of a breeze for one thing blowing through this stadium and I'm sure with Bradley's passing game it's gonna have something to do with it but the great thing about it is Missouri does have a good one running game again wilder and Ellison and Newman and the guys the backfield uh so you know it just it's gonna depend on I think how coach powers calls the game upsets and for the last two trips that Missouri has made to this place they have knocked off Nebraska now Nebraska is definitely going to get the bit to the Orange Bowl when it can come out they will probably have Penn State wins today and if Nebraska can win today they'll probably play for the national championship against picking out of Penn State but if Missouri can knock off Nebraska there's an excellent chance they're going to get a bid to the Peach Bowl after having won twice up here before what do you think the chances are of winning today I think I think Nebraska's right for enough said I really do I think they reached a psychological high last week against the Oklahoma when they beat Oklahoma Missouri had a great game last week against Kansas 48 to nothing they wanted to close out the season you know on a positive step they're going into next year and there's that chance like you say of a bowl bid so I think there's a there's a lot of stake for both teams but I just have a gut feeling that Missouri is gonna do it and Nebraska is right for an upset all right I think it's gonna be a super football game Missouri against Nebraska we're ready cold or not we're looking forward to a heavyweight college football game today and we'll be back with the starting lineups in the opening kickoff right after this message they to go with the kickoff for the final regular season game of the 1978 season Bob let's go through the starting lineups before we get started and we will mention that Missouri won the toss they elected to kick off so expect that in a few moments offensively for Missouri a quarterback of course all big a quarterback now Phil Bradley Jim Wilder at Earl Kent will be the running backs and across the front line all big a tight end Kellen Winslow Howard Richards at right tackle Stan left a right guard P dollar all big eight center mark Jones at left guard Dave Gunter at left tackle Lamont downer will be the wide receiver and the flank of number ten Leo Lewis further Nebraska's defense and offensive end George Andrews at the right defense he tackled an offense a cat the nose guard Perry wine master there right excuse me the lefty Bundy tackle rod Horn and Dylan else will be the left defensive end at two linebacker position you have Bruce Dunning and Lee Coons cornerbacks for Nebraska and he means number 34 and Tim Fisher number 16 the safety position Jim felon and Jeff Hanson and offensively or Nebraska at center Kelly saw field Tom Sorley the quarterback and reflect Franklin fullback Rick burns and I am hip will rotate it will probably be burned starting at the eye back Lake West and cotton the guards for Dick Clark will be the the tackles Miller the tight end Brown the flanker and Tim Smith the wide receiver across the front furred Missouri we got a window rain current Peter sent it in Steve Hamilton and Ron Sudha tackles norm Goodwin at the nose man his nose guard to linebackers Eric Burke and Chris garlic the quarterbacks Johnny Poe and all big a trust Calabrese the two safeties will be Larry Lauderdale and Eric Wright for Missouri today and we're about ready to kick off and our week old oh it is 25 mile an hour wind blowing as Kenny brown and Frank locket number 22 and number 80 go back deep for Nebraska to receive the kickoff as Jeff Brockhaus you know it might be so windy I don't know if that ball is gonna stay on the tee today or not well Missouri one to one the coin toss and they decided to kick off because of the wind factor in the game and let me tell you it is blowing that she said 25 miles an hour and it's even adding more down on the field Brown and lock it deep but here we go and it's going to lock it number 80 at the oneyard line gets a block and goes down at the 17 the 18 yard line 17 yard return for Frank Lockett so that's where the Cornhuskers put it in play first down in ten Jeffery Gaylord making a play for Missouri yep it's good on special teams it's me Overland Park Kansas he sure is he's a hitter you don't want to watch this Nebraska offense they can put points on the board they can rack up yardage but remember the last two times that Missouri has been in this Stadium they have won the football game Tom Sorley at quarterback get you back to ferns Rickford good points ten o'clock at the 45th a bird and records on the first play scores a touchdown unbelievable run from scrimmage but number 35 Rick bird from Wichita Falls Texas 82 yards off the left side and Nebraska right off the first play from scrimmage lead six to nothing thought they got that out of their system will settle down and do some work flying and watch this one again just gonna be a run outside outside two right there left offensive linemen all the way down the field see Peterson take a shot of Johnny Poe take a shot at it Hamilton him the last shot Amos right here if we to add some people down here we might have depending on the official Twitter rule the point after kick is up by Billy Todd and good and so with 14 minutes and 42 seconds left in the first quarter of this one the Cornhuskers suddenly break out on top 7 to nothing well that's one way to start a football game I was gonna tell you they say that Mizzou had 60 offensive linemen up on a line of scrimmage they're playing the 3d facts we still got outside so it's facts we still got outside so it's Missouri they have to make a little adjustment difference here now we're on offense and give us a Jimmy Whedon score in 8 seconds Billy Todd will be the man kicking off and Leo Lewis number 10 is dropping back deep along with Steve sly who wears number 28 both of those gentlemen standing at their 6 yard line mr. sly with that 9 for speed breakaway running a hundred yard dash in 9 seconds we would be hot again moving Titus came up real quick you're looking at Phil Todd Leo Lewis Steve slide deep and we're underway again the left foot at Todd booms it up as going to Stevie slide the 5yard line why is the 20th at sit go ahead Bob Knight is gonna say Nebraska a surprise to me they they've come to play today I'll tell you one thing about six people in unate a call right there and special teams that's any indication we're in for a long afternoon well you talk about a psychological low they sure didn't display at that time on that that one run huh Fred I'm repeating my words on their name of the psychological right now maybe not Leo Lewis and Lamont downer come wide to the right side Kellen Winslow lined up on the left Earl Gant Jim Wilder behind Bradley against got the ball at the 21 and that's about it as he moves forward stays on his feet across the 25 to the 27 yard line a gain of 6 so it'll be second down in four that was a nice run again perfect example of the desire and the guts of the the running back to Missouri Kent Wilder all year long have shown us some great desire they just was they refused to be brought down and I'm impressed more and more as every year as a game has gone by James gone by their ability to play this game Ken Blair checks in he has lined up wide to the right side as a handoff inside a gym Wilder spins and goes down at the 30yard line about a yard shy of the first down give him three on the play Bruce stunning stopped him beg Bruce Dunning sixfootthree 215 junior linebacker Nebraska oh my god oh that's what third down and what lesson lesson onethird Tanner we've got a double tight end situation in third down in a yard for Phil Bradley they hand it off Gary Ellison Ellis has got the first down well at least they're moving the football and that's the one thing they've got to do establish some movement on offense because Rick burns burned them on the first play from scrimmage that's one thing Steve this that we have to do Missouri has to do is we didn't have that breakaway like they did but if we can keep up just this consistent ground game and just pound out the ice we'll be right back in it no priors no time at all Gary Ellison Jim Wilder are together in the backfield now as Phil Bradley wants to put it up he fires to his tight incomplete at the 40yard line about five yards that time Jimmy Wilder going out of the backfield Steve nice catch for Bill Bradley beep we're back give you another little look at it see Phil's come back you can see see the Wilder just kind of floated out to the sidelines on the flat spot about a six yard pass 5fm second down in five ken Blair wide to the right side as a gift he can dance still on his feet again at the 45 yard line first down goes up fade to stop huh I tell you what did a clue maybe that score in one play but I'd say what I don't think they're gonna be kept out of the end zone it's gonna be a good game good run by our old dad watch it again I did pick a hole he sees and puts his head down and I break sure he's not to be brought down Bradley back to live action fires out to Lewis and complete with the cold weather like it is today Bob and the wind blowing what kind of an effect does that have on your hands oh it's definitely cold you know you and I are sitting here with our hands wrapped up and everything but the kitchen sink just to keep them warm and we're up here no I mean there Donna we've established that it's gold well it has an effect on them their hands get colder it there that you know their concentration you lose your concentration plus the balls gonna do funny things to him so you know second down and ten for Bradley all the option to Wilder Jim well at the 40 and Jim Wilder at the 38 yard line and that will be about two yards or three yards shy of a Missouri first down again Jeff Hanson in on a stop there's an ice block thrown that time by some of the three blockers we have seen the Tigers this so far this game run to the right side and passed to the left except for the one pass that wasn't completed they are using the right side running behind elect word Lechner and Richards and Pete aller third and three double tight in situation again Wilder an Ellis it goes to Ellis and Ellis has got the first down for the Tigers give him five more than enough more than enough we got Coons hoods and Anders in under stop forgive you another look at it this is the way the guys have been running all day all year really Yuri Alice getting the handoff right again great blocking right there Mark Jones point around Alex black Mary Richards great blocking there Jimmy no it's a chance to pick up four yards in the first down Ellis had 316 yards rushing coming into the game he's got nine today so 325 yards so far this season as gladly on first down as Winslow to the right side movement on the nebraska line no contact no flag Alison Wyler give it to it Gary Ellis and Ellis is stopped with a gain of a yard again in that play likelier pulled around the hour to look like trap on the left defensive end or right defensive minute abrasca and looked like Ellis ran outside instead of inside them it'll be second down and nine as we watch the Missouri offense on this Drive Bob it does not seem that that that run by Rick Burns has affected them psychologically at all they came back and they are pounding away at him now they could have they could have gone out with her diver down that's for darn sure but they didn't and their pond announcer yardage and is back in the lineup with Wilder Bradley on the option pitches back Wilder he's got Dan in front for a block Wilder at the 20 Jim Wilder at the 10 no he stepped out of bounds they're marking Jim Wilders forward progress at the 18 and a half yard line that will be of course a first down but he stepped out of bounds there well they got they got it running down the sideline you're gonna see a beautiful block right there by again but he did as you can see he just stepped out of bounds on the about the 18 yard line they're okay through one way low block as long as with the again you saw Buckner pull around a block and that time Wilder did run outside nice play Lamont downer and Kent Blair come wide to the right side Winslow is lined up on the Left Kent and wild her behind Bradley Hill to throw under some heat gets away from it Bru's complete to Lamont downer at the 10yard line and Bradley was very very close to being across the line of scrimmage when he released the football but he got nine yards so it's second down and one Jimmy a filling in on a stop for Nebraska that's again is is to me that the gutting us of Bradley he could have run the ball right there but he didn't he sighs receiver open they got the first on well actually we're just about a foot shy of a firsttime beautiful play by Phil Bradley we're not the thing that impresses me steam is that he's not afraid his wind and the breeze and this hole he's not afraid to throw the ball down and Lewis both go out to the left side on second down in the yard great place to put the ball into the end zone via the air that's what Phil would like to do fires it Oh incomplete intended for his big tight end Kellen Winslow just outside of Kellen's grass it was really not a wellthrown ball tell him could have had it maybe but it was not what you call a perfectly thrown ball and it bounced off his fingertip now there's an example of what the cold could do yeah to a guy's hands because his fingers just might be cold enough that they didn't have that feeling though and now a third down and one you expect him to go ahead and try and run the ball for the first down they've got Wilder and Ellis together in the backfield I'll give it to my horse double tight ends with Anderson and Winslow there's the run there's the touchdown number 32 that is his eighth rushing touchdown of the season and Missouri's right back at it let me tell you watched it Mark Jones Dave grunt or Pete Allard that time opened the hole big enough to drive a semi through we're gonna give you a shot at it watch the line open up a hole here what a hole Oh gunner drove his man clear into the end zone nice play Jim Wilder 34 yards on four carries rushing today 34 on four carries and that was his eighth rushing touchdown of the season is Brock out to attempt the point after Jeffery holes it the kick is good so to seven Steve yes sir nine at 45 left in the first quarter and we are tucked their right back in the game Nebraska with Rick Burns has run offensive play and they have scored the touchdown on that as Brockhaus kicks it away Lockett and brown are deep and again it's going to lock it one yard deep in the end zone lock it at the 15 hose it goes down at the 17 yard line what a hit by Tom Goodman oh he played off two people came in here and took them in his legs out from under what a play now we'll have to set this Nebraska offense for you once again watch this special teams play I know I'm good one are we gonna say it again hopefully can pick out norm Turner he's gonna be coming in here and a serried he just knocked down two I'll watch the hair right there oh nice play then he lines up over the nose man I'm sorely is the quarterback Andrew Franklin and Ric burns in the backfield Burns has got it again same play the other side no they're not going anywhere this time they got a yard so it's second down and nine Larry Lauderdale came up to make the stop Larry Lauderdale Steve Hamilton they say Steve Hamilton's were the best defensive lineman they've had player for quite some time Steve 63 230 senior out of st. Louis after high school he is a good one in fact that entire front line I think is excellent look at some of the fans in the stands and we are loaded today 75,000 99 consecutive sellout here at Memorial Stadium in Lincoln second down and nine for Nebraska sorely gives it to Franklin the first man in the line give him two so it will be third down now and about seven or six maybe to go Chris garlic making the play again in a little Chris garlic I thought it played well enough this year to make all big eight also but you know we don't get a chance to vote on it he was all big 8 last year well they got Phil Bradley Pete Allard his center Kellen Winslow all firstteam Big Eight Larry Lauderdale or check it rust calibrations Calvary rust Calabrese firstteam allbig eighth Leo Lewis got an honorable mention third down and six for the Cornhuskers solely to throw it up he fires almost intercepted by number 17 Ross Calabrese the man we were just talking about trying to hit big junior Miller they're sixfoot for 222 pounds junior tight in who is I understand it's one heck of a fine ballplayer 89 junior Miller Brasco Tim Smith is the man that will punt it away and Tim is averaging thirty nine point eight yards for a punt for Nebraska he's also the wide receiver and they have 30 Bill Whitaker deep not a big rush not a bad kick into the wind for Smith fair catch call by Whitaker and he's got the ball good field position for the Missouri at the 48 yard line that's where they'll take over when we return right after this times are changing it bends autoparts they've just moved to a new location where you'll find a largest selection of quality her back I tell you Steve I'm very very much impressed with the Missouri defense in their last Drive shut him down they did shut Nebraska down on first down Phil Bradley wants to throw under pressure he hits Kellen Winslow it's incomplete Winslow had it Winslow was hit and he dropped the football awful clothes off of clothes pilling and Hanson in on a stop I thought possibly Hanson might well put a then called for being here just a tad too soon that was a tough play to try and complete a short pass with immediate double coverage on Kellen Winslow they're not gonna let the guy have a queen shot at catching the ball all day long how they double cover him second down and 10 as they give it to Gant and slippery oil can't continues to break tackles it gets to the 45 yard line a gain of seven so we have got third down at three yards coming Lee Coons play making the stop I want you to watch Jimmy Wilder come up and hit the linebacker I believe what the linebacker filling a hole watch him he's gonna come up right between lekker right there nice hit very nice hit I'm Bruce Donnie by Jimmy wider open and a play up for again on third and two Tom Anderson checks into the game he had Winslow double fight in Ellis Ed Bradley a check at Ellison Wilder the two fullbacks in the backfield behind Bradley who big stars and Billy they got biased and Electr that time and Howard Richardson he loses three yards so it's fourth down rod horn got him it's time to put it away ride hard making a nice play breaking through it really didn't get Phil Bradley a chance to toss the ball off to Wilder he had over right here you can see while it was wide open if he's got it off here just a little bit sooner they've been a beautiful play we'd have gone a long ways nice play by horn Jeff Brockhouse will kick it away like oh I guess they pronounced it illegal bad kick pop rock down he shanked it off the right side of his foot the yardage on that is going to be about probably 10 give him eight yards total offense for that putt that time we'll be back right after this medicine three seconds left two good defensive stands the first one by Missouri the second one by Nebraska so now the Cornhuskers have it at the 40 yard line Rick burns 35 and burns gets five second and five coming Chris garlic broke through there and took on the took on him number 39 here and here Franklin Audra Franklin but he didn't get a lot of help Rick Burns has 89 yards rushing in this game on three carries but remember the first one was 482 second at five they sent Kenny Brown wide to the right side junior Miller lined up on the right they pitch it back to burns and burns is hit and hit hard a gain of two its third down and three Larry Lauderdale a nice play by a lot of this think it's impressing me now is all right they scored out one touchdown they got outside and they did do a fine job of blocking and everything else all right now Missouri's gang tackling we're hitting their Lauderdale was the first to hit him but there are about three or four other people in on the tackle this is what we're gonna have to have as gang tackling with an explosive ballclub like Nebraska third down and two they line up in a tight formation surly keeps pitches back Lockett has the football and Frank Lockett has got the first down and Lockett was lucky to hold on to that one I thought for a minute there was gonna be a photo that Eric Brett finally forced him out of bounds and Steve Hamilton is over there also you're gonna watch it's really a bad toss out but it was a great recovery I lock it check it Kenny Brown any way to any Brown I'm sorry came around on a a kind of a reverse play so it's first down for Nebraska Tim Smith the putter and also the wide receivers the only man out lined up on the left side Rick burns again and burns gets four yards second down at six and Nebraska moving the ball very well now they're starting to move a little bit to get a little momentum Erik Berg making a play for Missouri on that one but we can shut them down they only got three yards oh we're gonna have to do is we're gonna have to gang tackle we can't be tackling the legs and the ankles we're gonna have to be sticking our heads in the numbers because they're picking out three and four yards and they're falling forward lock it comes wide to the left side he wears number 80 in case early would like to pass it goes to Franklin the fullback breaks a tackle and it's down to the 33 another first down for Nebraska garlic finally bringing him down you can see right there were a couple broken tackles just just good individual effort by their running back for Nebraska we can't have those missed tackles you got a you got to wrap them arms are on if you have to lock the fingers it's gonna hurt the Cornhusker is moving the ball very well on the ground now Kenwyn garda checks in to the ball game for Ron Sudha Rick burns almost has a hundred yards rushing already today and he's got the ball again and he's taken down from behind excellent play by 98 dorm Goodman coming in from behind that's good hustle by Goodman they he had to come all the way over from his nose guard position we're gonna give you a chance to give you another chance to check him out watching good honor right there that's a great speed great lateral movement burns still got one still got five yards Bob yeah it's still a during good hustle he's got ninety nine for the day now second down in five for the big red they give it to Franklin the fullback that's the kind of tack when we got a have right there two yards and Goodwin got it good menon and window ray and the pun garden garlic and bird all in on the tackle that's the kind of tackling we've got to have we got to shut him down at the linemen scrimmage and that give him those two or three yard games every time they touch the ball and now Jim Catera comes in at fullback he wears number 44 on his jersey on third down and two I swear we gotta toughen up suck it up Smith way out to the left side I doubt if he'll see the football however no he doesn't they give it to burners and Rick Burns has got the first down at the 20 good Drive good drive by first you have together you have together offensive line some good credit Vick Kevin Clark you running right behind Kevin Clark and Barney cotton Kevin Clarke's only six for 275 pounds it's a small lad Rick burns came into the game with 678 yards rushing in and eight touchdowns and he's now got a hundred and five today he might catch up with I am hip who we haven't seen yet today it burns has it again at the 15 bowbow the chriskiss got it and I would like to see that play again and I would like for you to come in all the way they went after that fumble they they didn't go to cover the ball somebody was trying to dive on it very very slowly you see the hit right there doc done it for the balls like that you got to recover it you don't get those chances too often 27 was Larry Lauderdale who kicked it out of bounds and they end up getting 10 yards on the play the ball is just outside the 10 yard line so there is the possibility that they can get a first down I am hip number 32 is in the football game at the I back position it goes in motion to the right side they give it to the first man through Franklin inside the 5 and finally taken down about the 3 yard line Chris garlic making this play this car like a wind already there we got it we got it we got to tighten up we gotta tighten our belt strap our bootstraps a few other straps and I tell you what we got to get rid of the play cuz they're getting too much our knees too fast on the ground they are moving the football on the ground which is their strength offensively they can't pass and so Lee's a good pass are completing over 50% but their power is on the ground surly gives it off again to hip I am hip is stuck with a oneyard gain so it'll be third down and three now and again if they move the ball about 3 inches from the goal line they can get a first down Betty Smith many Smith could have had a tackle in the backfield again whether you're looking at some great running backs in the end and I brought down very easily you gotta have one or two three guys helped you already got a third down third down and three I am hip in the game and refrain : in the game those who your running backs Ken Brown is in tight of slot left side and Smith is wide to the left again I doubt if you'll get the football soily passes touchdown that one he was to his big tight at junior Miller number 89 and Nebraska now moves out to a 132 7 late you're gonna see junior Miller he's at the top of your screen he just kind of fades out to the side knowing Carver's name he's wide open catches the ball for a touchdown six points I told before the game that junior Miller just for some information junior Miller missed out on being all big 8 behind Kellen Winslow by just one vote juanzi and probably two of the biggest two of the best and biggest tight ends and the big 8 plane today that's right that was Miller's fourth touchdown catch of the 1978 season and now they've got bill Todd 14 in to try the p80 he's 38 out of 40 this year so actually he's 39 out of 41 now 40 out of 42 two minutes and six seconds remaining in the first quarter and you can see the score 14 to 7 Nebraska Leo Lewis and Steve sly are deep and Todd is going to sly at the 8 yard line come on Stevie show me your stuff here he runs into the back of Leo Lewis and goes down at the 22 a 14 yard return for Steve sly the freshman from Kansas City well we have seen two good offensive drives one fine abrasca won by missouri and of course the one big nebraska play that gives them the 14 to 7 lead two minutes left in the first period now let's check the offenses Allard comes out over the football Lewisohn down it to the right side Jim Wilder and Earl Gantt in the backfield Winslow lined up on the Left Behind Bradley they give it to cam Gant can't find too much running room give him maybe two yards and it's second down and eight tried to go why did they really shut that down nicely brought down by a host of Nebraska defenders and when they could they they pursued him outside and didn't let him get outside at least getting any Running Room outside and they shot him down the one thing Bob that dad likes to do is hit the right side right up at Stan Lecter and Howard Richards and then instead of going through the whole ride off outside to the right well a good backhoe follow his blockers blockers sometimes the plays aren't always designed turn around and they've got Bill Bradley one yard and that is it brought down by George Enders right in good hustle by George Andrews coming all the way across from his right side making the plan Bradley from the back tell you what look at that defensive front line from us before on Nebraska 223 245 207 250 195 not a whole lot of sizer as far as weight goes but a lot of speed they are quick and they're strong Tom Osborne preaches straight and weightlifting Phil Bradley doesn't like Nebraska's defense and he calls the timeout we've got 47 seconds left in the first period the one thing that if if you read the Nebraska media guide the one thing you will find or how much a player can bench press how much strength they've got very very important the time I was born I think like we were reading the press guide last night in the room and they'll say this guy is number third in the fence pressing this guy is third in the vertical jump or first and vertical jump it's very important to them and I think it's important to any any college team if their players are physically fit because I'm not saying that somebody like Kansas doesn't have a program like that but when you lose 15 people to injuries as Kansas has this year there's something wrong I know the Cardinals the sailors football Cardinals a couple years ago went out and hired a a what we call them a stretch coach and it really did cut down on the injuries that we had that year it cut down tremendously your muscles are stressed you're relaxed you're able to take a blow on the knee here a blow on the shoulder or blow on the head and really not get hurt you're gonna you're gonna feel it but it's not a crippling type of injury and so I think you know more and more coaches are going into these this type of programs and and the unity they've gone to using the outfit called a novelist which the Cardinals use and the Nautilus equipment about 15 or 20 teams the NFL do use it it is very good well Missouri on third down and seven they sent downer and Lewis to the left you can see him at the right corner of your screen Bill Bradley under Pete Holland and Bradley wants to throw Bradley tucks it away he's hit and Phil Bradley goes down with a three yard gain so that's going to bring on Jeff Brock House to put it away it's gonna give gonna give Jeff a chance to get his foot into it I hope Frank Lockett and Kenny Brown 80 and 22 as you're looking down her and Bradley come off the field dropping back deep Rockhouse has got the wind at his back he can get that ball up in the air you'll see I go a ton got it up nice putt deep punt going to brown at the 25 at kent brown and that's where the Huskers will take over nice putt that time nice par nice coverage by Jeff Brock House 47 yards so he bumped it as long as this year with 60 Kenny Blair finally made to tackle on the far sideline as we look at the field all right the one thing we saw the last time Nebraska had it they moved it on the ground Bob and they moved it very well how do you shut it down well obviously you're gonna have to make some adjustments but I'll tell you one thing they moved it on the ground because we missed some tackles and you can't miss the tackles you gotta you gotta wrap them up and you got a gang tackle you gotta get everybody there get off the man and get to the man who's got the ball Charlie gives it to Rick burns 35 and almost broke through the line finally stopped with a gain of four yards Chris garlic right there was a permit example do you see how he put his head and shoulders across the man's hips and brought him down you don't break tackle from you tackle like that 119 yards rushing for Rick burns the first quarter has come to an end and the Huskers lated 14 to 7 we'll be back right after they send Ken Brown in motion flip it back to Rickford burns at the 35 first gets two yards and that's it so it's third down in five and now is the time Bob the defense has got to do it well either right there you saw a perfect example steal AHA let's see we I see Norm Goodman and see Peterson I can see Berg coming back Eric right see all the guys coming back from to the huddle that's a kind of play you have to have we have four or five guys get in pursuit and she take them down mr. burns is not gonna be brought down by one fellow I'll tell you that Ken Brown wide to the right side Smith is on the left side and so Lee's gonna put it up it's only under pressure screaming bands to burn at the 40 Birds 50yard line Birds 46 first down Nebraska first garlic again hold them down nice screen pass they set it up perfect Charlie you're gonna be able to watch Charlie drive back and draw everybody in I watch him you could just see to me draws back in the plate put a little ear fear sir but you can see been guard and Steve was chasing them got a 21yard pickup 21 yards that's a tough play to play you got you got to be able to play that play defense it Shirley's got I am hip in the lineup but he gives it to Franklin and Franklin barely gets the yard and that's it so it's second down and nine good defense by Missouri Lauderdale Mater Dei I went in and tripped him up and garlic came over and made sure he didn't go any further I think this Nebraska team has got his son running back there's no doubt about it and I tell you what they got some horses on in front line the block for him too yeah they really do and you're talking about Kelvin Clark a guy from it that goes to 75 on the left side left tackle he's wearing number 73 they're gonna run kind of in his direction with him garlic misses a tackle and I am hip has finally tripped up by rust Calabrese Calabrese made one play there I think if caliber he's handed me that tackle he was off to the races the fiveyard pickup by hip but garlae Chris garlic made a play watch right here watch watch hip see garlic roll off spin off and mess up hips running pattern then Calabrese comes up knocks him down they've got her yeah Chris had to hit him he'd have gone a long way there was a wide wide hole there third down and four Smith is wide to the right side solely on a log count he's going to Smith California today when it rains it pours 30 36 yard pickup watch this Charlie Crouchback write dinner 21 Gary Craig breaks it up Smith grabs hold of it we're down on a four yard line that's up that's what you call a real brutal Braddock school boy that gets a unbelievable pass play that time and it sets up a first in gold for Nebraska I am hip flags are down it gets two yards but there's a flag at the line of scrimmage first flag of the day that's right it is I'd say you got to go you got to get the man in Smith to the ball you got to give him credit for the Smith that caught it that last play you have to give him credit for being alert looking back and being on top of things to catch the ball penalty it against Missouri halfway to the goal line so now we have a first down in one one yard one foot little offsides there's your signal there's that Nebraska offense well you got to stop him here otherwise they go up by two touchdowns we've seen Missouri fight back many times but this is tough now we can do it Franklin and hip in the backfield now hip goes in motion top of your screen there's no but Nebraska five yards back yes sir illegal procedure by Nebraska that's gonna be more than the five coach I'd say that's one thing see when we which we jumped off we locked the yard they jump off this is fine that's right I will show now I'm short number seven for jumping offsides little too anxious I give this a little breathing room get us a little room to work down here guys Chris a little room to hit some people come on gang sorry a little mixup with Ed's lock it wide to the left side and now Missouri has got to call a timeout so with 12 38 left in the first half Nebraska leading 14 to 7 we'll take a break I'm out remaining before the end of the first half as you look at the very chilly Missouri cheerleaders on the sidelines we had a little mixup on the field too many guys are not enough guys in the fetal they had to call timeout first down the ball is spotted at the 7 they give it to Burns and Rickford they stopped at the 6.0 ray coming in they're fun guard Adam around the ankles a window ray come in steal them off we're gonna take another look at it give me a chance to watch window watch gun fun guard I believe it's been guarded closed down right here bun Carter had him around the ankles or his big body was there for the guy to trip over then window ray come in and wrapped him up second down as they send Smith wide to the left side Brown who is the wing back his insight lined up right off the left tackle looks like movement flags knocked down at the line of scrimmage almost intercepted by Erik Berg Berg was on the ball there I'll tell you what they sent their big big tight in junior Miller just broken through the line that would have been a touchdown because there was a soul within five yards of him exactly nice play by Rick Berg big play by Eric bird third down now third down and one buddy third and six 36 ball spotted at the 7 yard line so Lee gives it to Franklin and Franklin his nail at the 9 for Thompson Hall he tried to qclone that that time he turned his head one way and hand it off to Franklin the other way and Missouri read it fake Kinmen guard to read it like a book watch it you're gonna take a look at it they tried it drop they tried to cross block I tell you what happened the back ran inside he should have ran between the cross block and he ran inside the man blocked from Gardner right into a thanks way by Kim man garden brings Billy taught in to try a field goal his kick is up and it's good 11 minutes 32 seconds left in the first half and now the Cornhuskers go out in front by 10 points at 17 to 7 9 out of 14 in field goal attempts is now 10 out of 15 a 26yard field goal and Nebraska leads 17 to 7 as he tries to tee it up better three better three than 7c oh sure here the picture of our 30 fly number 28 on the bottom of your screen and Leo Lewis 10 at the top of your screen deep to receive the kickoff from Todd I think Stevie Sliney just might break one one of these times if they get the ball over here to him maybe he'll do it now no it's Lewis with the ball at the 10 Lewis straight up the cut 25 26 yard line so Missouri on a 17 yard return as a good first down relatively good field position and plenty of time remaining in the first half to get back in it they are 10 points down as you see a Missouri football player not feeling very well lying on the astroturf but approximately the 26 yard line Brad Edelman is done being attended to at the moon Mike might mention Steve we got two great Missouri boosters in our box with us today now can hop out of st. Louis cannot builders and Bell caucus who I just was given a note by Al is attended 75 Missouri games in a row both home and away is that right so I don't know if that's a record but I'd say it's pretty darn good 75 well you've seen the good in the bad as he I like the number 75 that's pretty good well I tell you what Missouri's got a lot to be proud of with fans like you you are now both we're proud to be associated with you here we go Louis why to the right side and down or left and Phil Bradley to run the offense for the Tigers he pitches back Jim Wilder right well declares the corner at the 30 it goes out of bounds at the 32 so it's a fiveyard game second and five enemies finally forcing out of MA there's some nice blocking nice blocking that time again or again throwing a nice block see right here watch your a block out beautiful pug by Guinness boy it was to complement each other so nicely now bo Holloway is in the game to the left side Lewis wide to the right Gant and Wilder behind Bradley on second down and five they give to Earl gam there okay puts his head down keeps his legs going and gets across the 25 and he'll be a yard short of a first down he got four in trying to run a quick trap play up the middle bringing mark Jones are on a lead and let me close down pretty good George Andrews number 96 for Nebraska boy don't you know all those cheerleaders are chilly about 18 pair of pantyhose on 3rd hit a yard ball spotted 36 yard line Bradley so wilder and Wilder 'he's got the first down in about three more jimmy pillared over 29 for nebraska making the play yeah we we laugh about those pantyhose but I tell you what some of the some of the pros wear him to keep him warm and him cold ball games I'll put on a pair of pantyhose now you open up a can of worms did you ever wear them I could get any big enough gore on my 510 27 left in the first half Missouri 10 points down as Bradley a quick pitch out to Jim Wild at the 40 and Wilder at the 44 yard line a four yard day so it'll be second down in six as you look at the very very chilly crowd here at Memorial Stadium in Lincoln well you ought to see us do you think they're cold Phil Bradley took kind of on what I thought was a little unnecessary hit the end of the ball but a he's running the option well he's drawn in there defensive end but you are they hit the defensive it was knocking the heck out of him well that's what you got to do if you're an option quarterback right well that's what they tell me but I tell you I think twice about doing a to too many times on second and six for Bradley a straight handoff and Jim Wilder gets four more cuts making the play so it's third down into I take our whole bunch of lines doing a heck of a job moving the Nebraska people back but just keep up the steady driving there comes Bo Holloway number 81 into your screen with a play he gives it to Bradley on third down in two and Bo Holloway and Leo Lewis both go out to the left side Winslow is lined up on the right it is not a double tight end offense this is the first time we haven't gone double tight Bradley to Gant and Jantz got the first down across midfield to the 49 yard line three I pickup up again hard Richards of Stan lechner Kellen Winslow follow the big strong right side of his there the Missouri face here we go watch it look at right there look at hard rich hard Richard son David Clark he got rug burn on his tutu he got knocked back so far Louis to the left down a right you like that oh yes something Bradley on a spin he's got the option he doesn't want to pitch and he is male by about five of them two yard game second down and eight Bell Barnett coming across making a play Bradley wanted to pitch it out but they had to play pretty well defended they had to spread all the way out to the sidelines didn't have anywhere to go so Bradley had to eat the ball Holloway now comes back in his downer goes out and they bring a play from Warren powers we get a shot of Warner powers we had one earlier you can't even identify them they're so wrapped up down there it's got to be cold on that field because this sure as heck is cold up here hey it's colder up here than it is down there because we're above the stadium and the wind's coming in here Bradley to pass on second and eight under pressure gets it away Oh intercepted by George Andrews George Andrews almost had to have in a suit bad he understood because Collinwood was wide open or give you a chance to look at it I hope you can get a chance to see Kellen Winslow because he was wide open Bill Bradley rolling out to his right he got hit just as he let loose that might have been what pulled it off but boy was Kellen open Bradley got a whole bunch of heat that time third down and nine now we definitely definitely a passing situation I would not want to be a quarterback and the option situation you talked about because if they send two guys out like that there is no protection Bradley little drop 104 yeah well there's the 40 I would at the 35 push down Missouri all right hey nice play everyone expecting the pass play Laurence Cole making the stop honey but not until he picked up about 12 yards for a first down it takes third down and nine everyone expects passed and it was everyone played pass except Missouri and they had a drop play in the making good play Pete Allen comes out over the ball beautiful timing for that play Steve we run so many draw plays this year at all know that can rewrite we've run very few so ver the nice place Louis and Holloway Bradley wants to throw alright it it's knocked down as they intended it for Jim Wilder boy that was George Andrews again that's to our man if it is knocked down Bill's got a real life pretty soon he can't throw through that man you got there over him Bradley two out of seven in passing two of those have been knocked down a 14 yard it's also passing into the wind the wind is blowing in Missouri's face right now gesundheit was that a sneeze that was that was a little that was a very shallow cough because if I double pop as hard as I got a cop out of blown eardrums Oh second down and ten Bradley to Waller Jim Wilders the 30 and down at the 32 yard line see how Wilder grabs his offensive lineman that time he grabbed a gun during kind of held on to a falling truth that's some excellent running by waters next and blocking like under but I love the way they just latch on those offensive linemen let's Mike right set the offensive line and get the heck beat out of and they kind of follow through well that's what they're there for right that's true that's they're getting paid to do Jim Wilder 71 yards rushing so far today on 10 carries Gant has 38 it is third down in three Missouri has got to get another first down Wilder they close the hole down nicely and he is going to be what looks to be about 6 inches short of a first down did you see him close that hole yeah it open that was there and then for a free second and then it wasn't there it's just gonna be where they mark the ball where they marking it on the sideline it's the first time they're gonna measure now it'll be very close to a first down though there we're gonna see if it's not a first down I hope they go for it you got to go right you got two inches you can see it it's that clover just look at him close this hole down again Bob it's got to open up you're gonna see it open up and in Austin looking at it beautiful play number 40 Laurence Cole and number 40 Bruce Dunning close that down nothing's actually the man who come in and shut it down nice play Nebraska now we got a fourth down in inches okay Kellen Winslow and Anderson both in double tight ends McGary alice wilder you're back yep got the full backs in both of them Bradley sneaked it he should stick it got your horses in there what do you think quarterback sneak for Bradley and it looks like he's got the first down I would mark him at this point as having the first down again it's gonna be close it just it just depends where the officials mark the ball Steve I think they got it Tommy Anderson is clapping his hands like they've got the first down I read all of Missouri players say first time but they're gonna major it again well if you look at it it's not even gonna be close take a look at it on the on your screen and I don't think it's really gonna be that close it's not thanks to the football yes now downer comes back in so he's got a play Tom Anderson goes out there back to a single tight end with Kellen Winslow let's check the running backs for you when they break the huddle it looks like it's going to be Gannon Gary Ellis and that's who it is they're going Jimmy Wilder a break let him get some breath all you got to do is open open his mouth that wind blowing down here now Bradley what's the throw he's got Winslow open he goes to him complete at the 15 and out of bounds at the 13 nice play Jeff Hanson was willing but I tell you what with a receiver like Winslow you got to be on top of them constantly again you can't afford to let him go watch Bradley rolling out to his lips rolling out to his left there's Winslow big Kellen Winslow loving yard pickup first time Missouri Winslow's first reception of the day his 24th of the year he came into the game with 347 receiving yards so now he's got 358 say yeah I've got a mind like a computer but I'm working with Dave cough our statistician got me thinking like a UNIVAC machine now with a broken battery burst and Tim Bradley's got two receivers to the right side log count Bradley under some heat fires Winslow nice play hey Larry Talia was out of play Kalyn had to look down and see where he was that watch this one again yeah we're not gonna say it again we don't have that on replay but I tell you what Kellen Winslow caught the ball beautiful Garrity looked on he's tie it with one foot on short of the goal line and just get a little bunny hop into the end zone that's the way to do it right oh do we care how they get in as long as they get in that's Bradley's 12th touchdown pass of the year and that was Helen Winslow's sixth touchdown catch of the year as Brockhouse attempts to Patty Jeffery high snap Rockhouse gets it down and gets it up it's good six minutes and a half remaining in the first half and now Missouri has cut Nebraska's lead to 17 to 14 will for Watson Missouri get ready to kick off I got a note here I want to read there are 40 people from East st. Louis here today to watch the game you know there are seven players on the Mizzou team from each st. Louis we're watching the kickoff I'll get back to it in just one second all right it's going to lock it at the five yard line 15 20 hit and falls forward to the 24 does Frank lock it nice return go ahead Bob I just gonna say mrs. Perry Tony Greene's mom mrs. Mary green and Kalyn Winslow's mother mr. Winslow were in charge our seven players on the Mizzou ball club from East st. Louis and 40 of them came down they left last night at midnight by bus drove all the way here which i think is a beautiful if they drive all the way here especially us whether they got to be some proud moms andr Franklin the fullback I am hip is in at the I back position Lockett is wide to the writer that's hip with the ball and Hill is nailed by Chris garlic Wow I'm telling you Chris first was playing like a linebacker possessed he got it for a twoyard loss we're gonna be another chance to look at it Norm Goodman almost had him number 98 watch it right here watch garlic on his hit off all Christmas they didn't vote you call big a but you should have been second down and 13 ball spotted 21 yard line for the Cornhuskers kent brown the wing back is in sight on the left side in a slot position on count I am hip Goodman trying to catch hip he's got him but hip gains valuable yardage before Goodman could bring him down yeah the hosts the blockers out the front on that time give you a shot at how Nebraska there they had a bunch of blockers out in front him we couldn't break through it so our hands off the hip you see good with Jason some garlic jason raize black Eric Wright finding fun guard it brings him down they got 10 yards on it so it's third down and three Lockett comes wide to the right side the tight end junior Miller lines up on the left Andrew Franklin and hip in the back field behind sorely Brown goes in motion yeah that side again hip it's nailed but I think he may have the first down think he fell across Steve for the first down Bumgarner brought him down 77 he's going to be very close to that first down marker which is located at the 34 and now they're going to bring it out and measure it goes get a good picture of it from this anytime you're uh he got it but sure he got it Mike over football we are saying one find offensive show today between Missouri and Nebraska and right now Nebraska with two touchdowns in a field goal lead Missouri by three points the Tigers two touchdowns Missouri is here to play ball let me tell you well they're against the team that likes to play football second ranked team in the country the team that will represent the big eight in the Orange Bowl Kenny Brown slips and goes down he got three yards but he had he not slipped on the astroturf and it is wet down there that was that flanker reverse Steve and bless his little heart his little Tootsie's when I fell down on his boomboom because he was gone watch it again as he came all the way from the right side around back to the left yeah yeah it is big tight in junior Miller out blocking for him and he was he could have got a ton of yardage but he fell down second and seven surly pulls it out so he has the football well Shirley has got a first down and I don't think the Missouri defense do he had the ball Peterson and Peterson have been garden in her league in her garlic in here 25 yard pickup there you see it again I really don't think they thought he had it either and if they were surly Charlie had his back fouled him down the sidelines he could have fish it out he'll be the one or two he tucked that thing away and hit it on his hip nicely first and ten inside the 40 38 yard line and now slowly gives it to hip 32 and he has stopped after a gain of two by the way I am hip comes in the game today needing 92 yards to hit a thousand this year let's see how many has he got already 19 so got a long way to go but knowing I am hip and the kind of a runner he is you know he was a walkon did you know that night him he's from Chapin South Carolina and he is a walkon or was obviously he's under scholarship now we're talking about a talented walkon a lot of times T that's where some of your best athletes come from now they split it they send a wide receiver left they put a slot on the left side the fullback was the only guy back it's early wants to throw free March time all the time in the world and he is hit and hit again at the 31 so he got 5 yards Steve Hamilton boy Eddie he could have eaten his mother couldn't hit him flanker right there yet too much time he really did too much time alright our defensive ends that dropped off in the past coverage so we only had three men rushing they had five guys blocking that's a little tough yeah but it I would think wouldn't you that it's probably good that the ends were back there in past coverage that's what made him run obviously Iowa State leading Colorado right now 22:16 third down into I am happy and he did not get the first down Sun garden and garlic made a tool hidden I am hit right there lots of yard and hit play by Charlie handing off the hip now if they're coming up and go ahead and wrap them up and any garlic goes in there and seals it with a kiss it's fourth in three and Nebraska wants a timeout they want to decide exactly what they're going to do and if it's go for it now they're going to do it so we've got two minutes and 22 seconds remaining in the first half 17 to 14 Nebraska leaves will be records gonna go for a field goal they mark the ball at the 38 48 yard attempt it is up it's got the win but it is no good short five yard short but it had the direction so Missouri takes over at the line of scrimmage with two minutes and 15 seconds left not bad field position steers 31 yard line I'm telling you something do you realize they were comfortably Oh Lewis comes wide to the left side he is the only receiver out everybody is in relatively tight as Bradley calls it from the 31 Earl can't his hip breaks a tackle hit again and he got a yard total the man actually made a yard on that the offensive line broke down and the defensive line did a superb job watching rod horn was the first to stick him in a host of them I should say a whole whole something came in watch right here some nice blocking ride horn wasn't wasn't he wasn't the first one to hit him George Andrews was the first one to hit him the whole defensive line was there they played off everybody played off their blocks and got in the backfield on second and nine is 145 left in the first half moszer he's got the hustle up they have one timeout left Jim wilder and Wilder gets two yards as the clock continues to run to a minute 30 color guards are still the center two tight ends third and seven Bradley to throw flips it out to Jim Wilder complete and Wilder can't get out of bounds so the clock will continue you get the first down eight yard gain the official stops it so they can mark the ball and move the chains headline passes got to get out of bounds to stop the clock Lewis wide to the left he's the only receiver out Bradley hands off again the Jim Wilder who gets it across to the 47 yard line a gain of five 30 seconds left in the first half and it all of you know I don't see him getting a touchdown first I hope I eat my words well they're gonna hand off that Jim Wilder cuts it back inside and that will be the last play of the first half unless they got a play called which they do well they do don't they the kind of thing called to please now they gotta call timeout to reset the chain exactly the clock has stopped with 19 seconds left ready to throw the ball out of bounds or hit somewhere in a down and out here we go hurry up offense Bradley fires it out he to complete intended for Lewis but he didn't even try and throw it to him just that's just the old stop the clock play feet I got my feet underneath things grace there's how bad the wind blowing they all Bradley back under heat throws it and it complete intended for Bo Holloway there are eight seconds remaining on the clock please play was broken up by Jeff Hanson five seconds Phil Bradley you gotta fire it up cows will be kicking off Nebraska will be receiving with Ken Brown 22 and Frank Lockett number 80 back deep as you watch Jeff Brock house it is 17 to 14 in the Cornhuskers leading the Missouri Tigers thanks to Steve Kenmore for talking with us as I say he is our spotter but it's recruiting time and it is time to start picking up the football players for next year as Brockhouse gets it up into the wind lockets got it at the 10 lock at 20yard line block at 27 yard line and that's where Nebraska takes over first down seven Nebraska will be receiving with Ken Brown 22 and Frank Lockett number 80 back deep as you watched Jeff Brockhaus it is 17 to 14 in the Cornhuskers leading the Missouri Tigers thanks to Steve Kenna more for talking with us as I say he is our spotter but it's recruiting time and it is time to start picking up the football players for next year as Brockhaus gets it up into the wind block it's got it at the 10 block a 20 yard line like a 27 yard line and that's where Nebraska takes over first down 17 yard return by Lockett and now we will find out exactly what Missouri can do or yeah what composure e can do defensively what Nebraska is going to be doing offensively Audra Franklin I am hip in the backfield behind Tom Sorley and they give it to hip check it Rick Burns is in the game at the I back position and he gets a couple of yards so it'll be second down now and about five yards to go I'm back hello mother nature called my answer Nebraska's got two receivers wide to the right side as sorely about ready to call it no Flags go down sorry to throw it across the middle and it's been played 22 Kenny brown at a first down for Nebraska right on the money Steve Lauderdale and right we're right with him all the way but the pass is right on the money nice reception take a look at it's all he's gonna drop back find his man look at he threw it right in between the two of them due to the wind if they want to stay up there the running game has been so powerful Rick Barnes breaks a tackle and had he stayed on his feet he would have had another 7 or 10 yards I'd say Chris garlic Chris Carrick took a mine at I ain't took on Cali style field that time with Franklin and burns in the back field behind surly that's Franklin and he's nailed at the line of scrimmage fall forward for a couple in that I think will be a first down for Nebraska if it's not a first down it's very very close ignoring Goodman and kenmin garda making the play for Missouri I would think they're gonna bring the chains out now it's a little bit little frightening Nebraska's moving the ball fairly well down the field here we go it is third and a yard to go one wide receiver out that is Smith everybody else is in tight quarterbacks me yes it is and sorely gets the first down a gain of two so Nebraska continues to move the football and they continue to do it on the ground they is shaking that is a mild way of putting what he's doing on first down for Nebraska they give it to the I back that's par as he breaks a tackle and he gets it down to the 32 yard line nice hit garlic and Berg three yards second down in seven and watch it again as Rick burns barrels his way over the left side nice play you're gonna see it right here watch Chris come in there boy they open more holes Audra Franklin was the guy who opened the last one in through the last proc with that offensive line for Nebraska just blows folks right off of there on second and six Ricky ferns first is finally holding it dead at that point and they are saying it is Nebraska's Paul Warren powers is just beside himself on the sidelines watch it again did he bumble or did he not fumble the ball I believe me I showed a little class here if I keeping my cool this is a fumble dark garnet he fumbled the football the ball was stripped loose before he hit the ground the only thing keeping them apart from being zebras their stripes are going up and down boy well that is a bad call no excuse for that especially the game that's darn close by the way Rick Burns has just established a new Nebraska University career rushing record there's one thing that there's one thing to be down in the ball bounce out of your hand but there's on the left side Miller lines up on the right burns it's in the I back spot Franklin the fullback behind sorely that is a break that did not go and Missouri's favorite should have and they nail ferns garlic is the guy laying on top garlic has the football thirties they're 20 when they fumble again no I know garlic I think took the ball away from him after the play was dead that time Valley blue the last let me make blow this one who knows first down you can see garlic come out of there out of the the pile with the football alright you give me gets a little angry first and ten for Nebraska Lockett his way out to the left side now they've got a fat weight Commerce Kenny brown hit my poet finally knocked out of bounds all the way down to the eight yard line swing back reverse with Kenny brown brought him at about the third time they've run their play he sets out in the five positions blanked out to the side bring him back all the way back across and he enough off to him what hey what was that sixteen yards all the way down to the 9 yard line first and goal for Nebraska if they score here Missouri could be in trouble Brown as the wing back lined up on the left in the slot sorely pitches it back at the 10 and out of bounds and about the same spot hey lots of yard I think possibly picked up a yard picked up on your and I thought possibly might have lost yar but he did pick up a yard nice play against our Lee Charlie in the fake keeps the ball right there he's played well but you guys no outside force no outside force from anybody second down and goal the ball is at the 8 yard line so only wants to throw solely has to eat the football at the 11:00 Wendell ray 90 was chasing him he's the guy that finally hit him and knocked him out of bounds along with 68 Chris garlic three I losted this is where we this is where we seem to get our toughest rust Calabrese is laying in the end zone as you look at this play again see right here they don't quit 100 ray and garlic with her great speed come up and grab sorry throw him out at the 11 for a threeyard loss that is rust Calabrese 17 you're looking at now and it looked like he may have a problem with his right knee I didn't get a chance to see either that or he is obviously not feeling well we've got 11 minutes in 26 seconds remaining and the third period the horn Gus Cadogan record Oscars are leading 17 to 14 is just a summer getting there getting some good to get some good your honey's out of that pitch out play Frank lock it wide to the right Franklin and burns behind sorely lined up in the eye and brown is in the slaw bright burns burns down at the 2 yard line and a nice open field tackle by Eric Wright because had Eric Wright not stopped him that would have been 6 9 yards right Turner knows man look like our nose man jumped over to the left there a lefty fitzy side right deep edgy side just yeah well we got a had a shot out of those too late but left a ton of a whole mile wide run into docked on it 10 minutes 55 seconds left in the third period Nebraska about to make it 23 if they can get into the end zone let's hold them that's all the Mizzou burn touchdown 23 to 14 well you can't give him that kind of daylight you can't give him that kind of time you haven't had much room to run because they're gonna do it he really just steps inside right here he doesn't even have to go anywhere you gotta walked in I'll tell you though that offensive line for Nebraska did an unbelievable job because he ran between his center Kelly Sol field and his left guard Barney cotton and they opened a hole that was huge the point after attempt by pill Todd is good Lewis or deep to receive the kick off Billy Todd Nebraska has scored they lead 24 to 14 and the South Park kicker booms one nice and high to Hill at the three at the 10 Jerry he'll hit the 20 and falls forward to the 23 yard line nice coverage by Nebraska under kickoff that's one thing I've noticed about Nebraska they've got excellent special teams as does Mizzou so you've got you know you've got all three facets of the game playing an important role in the outcome of today's ballgame this is a very very important I wouldn't you agree Bob a very important offensive series for Missouri I'm gonna say to you this is this is gonna be right here with ten minutes and then ten and a half minutes left in the third quarter this series right now man Missouri has to do something very positive Earle GAD Jim Wilder in the back field behind Bradley and it's Gant Gant breaks a couple of tackles and gets the ball out to the 32 yard line a gain of 7 yards so it'll be second down in three brought down by rod horns just a 259 pound child watch this one they can't get carried people on his back this time again and he runs up behind Jones and Gunder and Allard gets hit and gets a lot of yard he's on his own and Jimmy Waller was right in there leading the blocking for him too leading interference ball at the 32 second down and three the give is to Jim Wilder breaks a tackle still on his feet and Jim Wilder across midfield now he dropped the football but they're going to rule that dead also which is that what is that that was that was dead there's a difference you know watch it again and then I want to talk to you for a second brought down by Tim Fisher who is much wilder watch one dart gun use a little rascal 20 yard pickup that guy is so gutsy he could be in the NFL right now boy he's a great runner you know we're of course sitting up in the booth cheering for Missouri but we wouldn't do that if we didn't didn't think that the call that was made before was a bad call that this one was a good call we'll call him likely Sam the pass complete the Winslow from Phillip Bradley at the 31 and another first down Kalen turned around handing the ball the defensive back to it over there Guardi watch it again as Winslow went out in found room to catch it right here well and kelan came all the way across field Bradley rolled out to his left and threw all the way back right 16 yard pickup ball spotted at the Nebraska 31 Missouri has got to get in the end zone they have got the fit get themselves back in this game we said it's an important drive a busted play Bradley wanted to hand it off and the man I think it was Jim Wilder was too far away from Bradley to get it so he ended up getting a yard and that's in definitely missed play Bradley was left standing there wide open with the ball that was Gary Ellis 43 second down and nine two receivers to the left side the wide side of the field and Bradley wants to fire to him bill cruise into the Intune Oh move to the end zone at least to the 2 yard line to Kellen Winslow you know I thought I thought as I watched Kelly Winslow that he was going to break down to the post and he didn't he came straight across aren't you right here a nice pass by Bradley now we've lost sight a winds a little bit look at it look Bradley the way he ducks around and picks up 33 yards on a pickup butI yards on a pick up beautiful play you're down on the oneyard line again Winslow showing you why is the tremendous athlete that he is and this gives some credit that offensive line for some fine blocking Ellison Wilder behind Bradley at the oneyard line Ellis Ellis did not make it and that I hope we can see that again that was a very dangerous handoff watch the handoff Nebraska was almost at the handoff spot they could handoff right there they had some great penetration that time George Andrews got in there he was almost there like you say as the ball was handed off we got our two horses in there we got Ellis Jimmie Wilder in the back they're gonna score take my word for second in one why don't we run a quarterback option as he spins and takes it in himself what do you think of that I want to give it to the stud okay this does got it and goes down at the 2 yard line but Wilder loses one second down to two that's all right get in there it is now third down and the ball is spotted at the two third down and two well now we got a score the Cornhusker defense rose to that occasion that we talked about so often that occasion is like Christmas or Thanksgiving it it's there all the time Wilder and Ellis Jim Wilder falls forward did he get in no he did not down to the oneinch line looked like it he is that close and Missouri is going to have to go for it on fourth down we're gonna go for it I think got to look out to be inches but what do you call do I give it that I do it Jimmy Wilder again I would I would we've tried Wilder hey guys see if he got a yard amp right there because of his determination and the ability not to be brought down he really did sounds like a good call Bradley wants a timeout he wants to call it to power they get a timeout 716 remaining in the third quarter his defense just on the opposite scope they're gonna have a tremendous upsurge their offense is already over in the sidelines going crazy they want to get back in and try and score again so Missouri has to score and we got to score to stay in the ball game we only guys look at seven minutes to the third quarter Bradley I'm sure so we're talking is we see right here talking to coach powers these and coach powers is getting some calls from his coaches up here in the box so I I don't know I just if I if it was me I'd give it to Jimmy Wilder and just say follow hard Richards and stand like me and go get some yards I can't see because of the angle of the shot but it looked like he may also have been talking with Mike Price Mike is the quarterback coach and he is the man I think mainly responsible for doing so very much with Phil Bradley this year and bringing him around to a pick time card oh look we got to go the officials down here way when I'm telling them if you don't get out there I'm going to grab the yellow hankie whatever it is Bradley has got it in his head he'll go tell his team now and they will try on 4th down and inches to get into that Nebraska endzone believe me right now the Nebraska defense feet aren't on the ground and the Missouri offenses feet aren't on the ground this is this crowd you're gonna go crazy the crowd is nebraska's they're calling for the defense's Bradley asked for some quiet bad snap while a touchdown all right boy let me tell you what dump we're okay we're okay darn Bradley don't do that to me stay there laying on the ground like you've been shot watch it watch the snap from center there's a bad snap Oh Gary boho unbelievable I want to tell you something you know they could have been just that delay right there that little bobble right there that could have made that play work may be goofy but no no that's very logical the guy right there he's just the guys at blasters they're playing they were diving in guys through the block Jimmy Wilder got in Brockhaus his kick is good so Missouri did not let up for the second time in this football game they come back in the only trail by three 24 to 21 will be we said before Missouri starting to dry that this was a drive that would determine I think the outcome of the game possibly and he did they just marched right down the field as they passed the Iran and you know the guys didn't quit can't while they're everybody now the defense has got something to live for to fight for and let's get it Franklin and burns in the backfield behind Tom Sorley one receiver right as Franklin gets the call at his nail by Chris garlic gotta either on the line or a yard loss one of the other excellent play by the linebacker from Kansas City I tell you I mentioned it once before he wasn't named allbig 8 but he sure in blazes it playing like it he's made about five six seven maybe eight or nine individual stops today and now they send Tim Smith wide receiver to the right along with Ken Brown in the slot to the right and sorely wants to throw and he throws it Oh Chris Chris garlic down at the 31 and what a super play well again by Chris garlic we don't have a replay oh but I can tell you one thing he was trying to hit us big tight in crits whatever his name is trying to hit his big tight in and garlic's in front of it jr. Miller jr. Miller well Chris Chris intercepted that's what I knew is Chris somebody you got Chris there don't you yeah I'll tell you what now this is what a play this is vitally important because the momentum has been swinging the last two drives toward Missouri they have it now downer and Lewis line up on the right side dant and wilder behind Bradley Winslow is lined up tight left they have got to get back in the end zone Bradley to throw on first down fires it out short and far away from Leo Lewis I really don't I just had to be to me it was just a broken up broken play I don't really think there's any well Louis looked at Bradley and kind of shrugged his shoulders and Bradley looked at Louis and kind of shrugged his shoulders so it was either a bad pass route or a bad pass second down to Tim look like I might have been a bad pass road I don't like that passing all the way across the field either no that is tough Kent Blair wide to the right he's got single coverage out there Bradley on the option keeps cuts it up there apparently at the 20 Bill Bradley at the 10 5 and Bradley to the 3 yard line all right boo boo oh brother 47 yards by the quarterback the sophomore quarterback from Macomb Illinois watch it again finally chased down by George Andrews number 96 for Nebraska but watch this play by Bill Bradley he chased all the way out here tonight chased down from the back there trying to catch him Knight touch the ball away breaks one tackle breaks two tackles down to about the 3 yard 4 yard line what a play by Phil Bradley first and goal at the 3 yard line Lewis is wide to the left Winslow and Anderson double tight end situation Bradley gives what can you say Jimmy Wilder watch it take another look at it right in behind macho's gunner look at there Oh tuck the head go and Missouri for the first time in this game takes a 27 24 lead 5 minutes 58 seconds left in the third period and Jeff Brockhaus will try and make it a 28 24 game and we're not gonna be tonight let me tell you Jeffery is down the snap the kick is good 2824 Missouri well I'm telling you what that was a very nice offensive drive when they had to score they scored and then garlic got the interception and when they could take a lead they took the lead and now Missouri for the first time in the game is out in front and suddenly people are thinking upset many Mizzou are going crazy black and gold sit down here in front of us Missouri flags are being run all around the end zone we got to see a rip and everywhere every once in a while you can see a black and gold hat or black and gold banner or something waving in the mini Mizzou is here they listen to us Steve they weren't gonna have another game like OSU where there wasn't a person there it means so much to a football team to have their cheerleaders in their fan in there their fans screaming form they have got to hear somebody out there rooting for them we didn't hear any of that at Oklahoma State there are fused some few loyal fans down there but you know you need that school spirit you need that band you need those pretty girls on a sideline in the short skirts yelling the a18 you know well you need that they don't need hats but you yeah there's a good picture let me tell you what they're a dedicated group right here over in the fire corner you can get a little shot of the tuba horn that's a mini Mizzou down there freezing like the rest of us or they make a lot of noise don't think they're gonna walk around for the next week with them mouthpieces stamp to their lips oh my nose that is way down below there I like that so my toes are saying block it is gonna receive it at the five there's seven up on the far side watch it passes Isaiah watch the pride of chip because he just broke that play up they did a job on that one you can see you can see Nebraska setting up defense all along the far side of the field all right right there the pass all right chip way to read it Harry I'm telling you he did a whale of a job why don't you see what you mean by oh hey we're were farmers Mastodon who's fired up to the rest of this group I got it I gotta say war first down for Nebraska at the 10 pitch back to Rick burns and they trip him up over 13 yard line Rick burns got two so it'll be second down and eight guess who made the stop Steve Steve Hamilton no Chris garlic Chris guy weighing like a man possessed today and never once before but he has he's all over the field like it goes out of the game Tim Smith is in on second down at eight we've got five and a half minutes left in the third period sorely since Smith way out to the left side now they put Ken Brown in motion the wingback pitch it out they're going to reverse it fake reverse Rick burns it was not going to be a fake reverse though because Brown went in motion from left to right stop turned around and Burns was going to hand him the football but Ken Brown slipped down store Lee's gonna have to put it up spins fires complete and hit and it's going to be close to a first down I don't know if they'll have it or not I think they marked it I think they gave a first down jr. Miller nice pass play you look you're watching two of the greatest tight ends in the big eight play today first down you're watching two of the greatest tight ends in the country this year yes or the holy Custer's whichever pitch it back Rick burns Rick Burns has a block and Rick burns gets to the 31 yard line a gain of mine so it'll be second in one and it was Eric Wright that finally got him garlic and right over there keeping her from going I want you to watch the blocking all along the right side right there they just they bring everybody down great blocking by the other up back I know that was hip linear whether or not Andrew Franklin great blocking they're wiped out our defensive end let him get outside you can see the measurement that's how close it is it's not even a full yard just a few inches let me give you a question now you've asked me questions out here you got second down and inches to go you send somebody on a fly pattern and try and hit them not in the position abrasca is in right now they've got the wind in their face and they need to establish a drive I would think ok receiver out everybody else is in very very tight and they do run it up the gut with Barnes first down and more to the 43 nice call I ran it right up the shot for 11yard good write up the shot right let's shine for the level our cards yeah well over 200 for the days over I am hip is just taking a break on the sideline slowly keeps and is hit by three Missouri Tigers at midfield a gain of eight so it will be second down and two Eric Bergen here number 36 bralla Chris garlic Charlie is hurt slowly the quarterback yes he is he's down and he is in pain he was hit by three men now if sorely has to go out of the game we anticipate that we will see Tim Hager number Ken come in yet which is good news he's a fine athlete so Hagar's the quarterback and he gives it to burns and burns his nail at the 49 right on his 5 lb number 92 at my man Benny Smith from East st. Louis one of the people were Benny's mother was one of the people that organized the 40 people for me say Lord come to this game now locket comes in Smith goes a block it's got a play for Hagar Jimmy Hagar 61 178 pounds junior from Lincoln is now the quarterback for the Cornhuskers on third and a yard Mitch back to Rick burns first turns the corner he has the first down Johnny pol forced him out of bounds but not until he gets the first down and got three yards on it burns just a fine runner he's got that outside speed he's got the ability to get outside with his blockers and pick up the necessary yardage right there look at him turn the corner nice hit by Johnny poll but not until he got the first down Burns has 182 yards today rushing that's a whole bunch Billy Whitaker by the way has replaced rust Calabrese on this Drive Russ is still out walking around Hager wants to pass he's got a man I put his tight end Miller but there is a flag down there is a flag down at the 47 yard line let's see what it is Miller was not OBO shoe Steve I think so man in motion check it against Nebraska all right nullifies a touchdown guess what little little action under sideline well we didn't get the man in motion there's a long in jr. Miller was wide open diamonds down to the noahic touched anyways there wasn't anybody within three miles of Mikey there was definitely a broken timer can you run that back to us again I want to see what the coverage was in the secondary yeah Brown goes in motion the pitch back to burns Brown gives him a block and burns played off the block and Chris garlic came in and stopped him again that whole right side some excellent blocking by the right side of Nebraska's line because Byrne got around that corner he got 9 yards on a pickup he got around that corner had all kinds of room to run they're doing some excellent blocking birth all right here's that that pass in the secondary again let's see if we can see the coverage I don't think we're gonna get a chance to I think what happened to jr. Miller just a Mike sneak snuck sneaked through the line nobody even saw him he was wide open back to live action Rick Barnes and burns down to the another first down for Missouri Wendell ray stopped him until after he got about nine yards and Nebraska is moving the football like we saw move in the first half and they're doing it with Rick burns and that offensive line blocking hagar on a little reverse to the wing background that's a flank reverse again see and he got nowhere he was nailed his best forward progress was at the line of scrimmage easy coach sit on over there easy down big fella a minute 38 seconds remaining in the third quarter of the game Ken Bumgarner checking back in now and that'll move Ron Sudha well Mehran soon is gonna stay in the game we're gonna Hamilton is gonna come out so we've got both Bumgarner who is now and let's check he is going to the left side he is that the left tackle spot and sudha is at the right tackle spot I put a little weight over on that far side exactly and they've got Peterson and Ray on the outsides at the end positions gonna pass Hager they need pressure on Hager complete the burns a flag is down and I'll bet you a dime to $1 we're gonna get a roughing the passer Larry Lauderdale right here I think that's it Larry Lauderdale whether it be frustration or whatever went in at level Hagar and he did it too late the one thing that offensive line is doing Bob aside from the fact that that they're doing a great job on run blocking they're doing a great job on pass blocking they're not getting any defensive pressure at all from Mizzou katara has come in at fullback he's blocking for burns a flag is down as burns gets inside the five Aflac was dropped what looks to be behind the line of scrimmage on both of the outside so it could be I would say against Nebraska but the brassicas saying it's against Missouri outside yes it is I'm sorry Missouri or left little mistakes hurt us now penalties are starting to hurt us bad norm Goodwin checks back into the game and Eric Wright goes out so they are trying to get some meat up on the line of scrimmage and in the linebacking situation we got it we got to get ourselves together because we can't let these penalties right now they've gotten 20 25 yards just on penalties this laughing this drive second down in a yard to go the ball is spotted just inside the five at the four Hager rushes and Suffolk scores Kim Hager not too bad first not too bad a play for your backup quarterback comes in and does that does a job he did right there seeing the oranges throw down the field too symbolic because the brass the door to the Orange Bowl there he's watch Hager right there we're about a five or six yard touchdown Eggers only rushed the ball coming into the game 16 times he had not scored a touchdown so he would be obviously the scouting on the guy was you don't expect him to do anything and he did if we can block this extra point he'll put us a field goal away the kick is good and it is a 32 31 to 28 game we've gone past Nebraska whole list of 15 it comes to Louis at the 11 Leo across the 25 to the 26 so Missouri's got 48 seconds left with the wind at their backs on offense 48 seconds and then they're going to be facing the wind and it's almost a position where you would think Bob that they would would like to try and get the lead back before they change well at the 26 first if it's the can't stop I can't quite break the tackle he wanted to break he got two yards so it'll be second down and eight nice play that time by number 38 Kunz for Nebraska there was some beautiful blacks thrown inside luckier I should say Mark Jones came around through a nice block but Gant felt he could get outside and that play downer comes wide to the right side as they pitch it back to Jim Wilder Wilder breaks a tackle boy he is a hard man to bring down and he got seven more so it'll be third down in about a yard to go for the first down in Lincoln Nebraska Bradley hands it off the wilder breaks the tackle Jim Wilder at the 48 yard line first down Missouri you know I think Jeff Hanson was holding on for dear life 13yard pickup that first down gives us a first down all the way down to about 249 year well 48 yard line the Henson was hold on for dear life it's just praying for three or four other Nebraska players to come in and grab Wilder before he broke loose and that will be the last play of the third quarter 31 to 10 Bradley throws the winslow complete and Winslow at the 11 yard line a flag is down but a flag went down after the play was whistled dead I would have to think it's against Nebraska let's check out and find out I'd like to weigh some of the Missouri players gathered around the official it is a clip plus re clip the play will be called back it went for 42 yards and it was just a quick look in by Phil Bradley to his tight end Kellen Winslow but somebody tossed a block down around the knees behind him I'm asking our own asking my coach here let's see it again see if we can pick it up it's a beautiful play just a quick hit to Kellen Winslow let's see what happens right there up on the upper corner you saw the clip by Lewis Leo Lewis close the others we're still got a first and ten or we're not near as close as we were nope the ball went down to the 11 yard line and now it's back out to the 37 as they sent Lewis and Bo Holloway to the left side Bradley wants to throw again into the wind under pressure friendly always nailed he gets it away complete the Lewis Lewis at the 10 and out of bounds at the 4 and Phil Bradley is up and he is alright you believe that place won't believe that play that play Lee Lewis was down there all by himself 33 yard pickup Lee Lewis was off done the down field all by himself but I'm sure they thought Bradley was gonna get sacked well Bradley picked him out and tossed it I'll watch this here's the Bradley do some fancy footwork here could eat almost almost right out Allah he got decked is he through the barn he got it to Lewis what a play what a play by Lewis what a move by Lewis takes him all the way down to the 4 yard line what up play the two fullbacks Gary Ellis and Jim Wilder are behind Bradley Bradley wants to throw looking for Lewis over his head incomplete Lewis was trying to shake Tim Fisher the defender who by the way is the nephew of Pat Fisher who played of course with the st. Louis football Cardinals and then later with the Washington Redskin great little defensive back probably one of the greatest defensive backs per pound that ever played the game of an international football league boy he was a vicious tackler what a ballplayer Lewis comes out of the game Ken Blair 82 is checked in let's give it to our horses this give it to the guys have been so good to us all year who tight ends are in the game so expect a possible run bubble at the line of scrimmage Bradley's got it back but Bradley fumbled the snap from Pete Alex so that brings up third down third down and four now listen Wilder and that timeout is being called by Nebraska Wilder and Gant in the backfield Long Count by Bradley straight up the gut pump oh okay double the football and Nebraska I think has got it there happens we're not gonna say anything till we see the officials hand stand by Nebraska says they have it and they got it they're still try they're still fighting for it they still haven't determined who's guy now there we go you asked me earlier whether the cold would have any effect on anybody I think right there is a perfect example well it was a bad exchange between Bradley and Ghent and nobody ever had any control of the football watch it once again we're gonna look we're gonna take a key under another gander at it he got stuck all right well he never even had the ball the ball hit the ground before the linebacker even hit him a very very decisive defensive series from Missouri they give it straight up to Franklin the big fullback and he stopped at the 21 a gain of two so it'll be second down and eight Steve Hamilton garlic bird making the play this is defense time that's why we gotta keep him here we could have had them down around the three yard line who is that down on the field for Missouri that leaves like finneysmith been eight ball spotted at the 22 yard line Ken Brown in motion pitch back to Rick burns burns cuts the corner gets good yardage out to the 30 but there is a flag down could be I don't know it's wait and see yeah let's just not go hon it's against us again I don't know what well they smash the indication was I think against Bumgarner I'll check that finish this official pointed at Kennebunk garda penalties are hurting us penalties are killing us watch this let's see what happens right here I don't know who they call it on I just don't see a face mask against Rick burns Chris garlic wants to know who is it on he'd like to know who the both who it is I don't think the official can tell him I hope these officials don't let this game get out of hand with all these flags well it's first down for Nebraska we've got 13 and a half minutes left and Nebraska leads it by three Missouri's got to stop him got to get the ball back and must score a touchdown inside handoff to Franklin and we'll make one other note Tom Sorley is back in the game at quarterback record of some sort well he set a record in the first half with the yardage he had then there we go only under Haden Charlie it's gonna be wrapped up and goes down all right it's a way to stay with a win or a steve hamilton both were there and Charlie wouldn't go down finally Hamilton graduated threw him down so I'll third down at fifteen or fourth down now nice one again this brings up to a fourth down watch this go see Charlie drive back nice pressure right here Lendl rape on the Left Hamilton from the right Briony of Hamilton dragged him down seven yard loss on the play Bill Whitaker is back deep Billy Todd check it Tim Smith will punt it away this is only his second run of the day he gets a high one into the wind Whitaker lets it bounce and we'll have to let it go now and Nebraska will kill it inside the 20 yard line at the 19 well that took an odd bounce I got a hit summary sport I did too I really did I guess it didn't yeah I did Bruce bringing it back up okay 41yard punt somebody's around we'll back up in Lucy 41 m82 37 36 yard punt and we've got 11 and a half minutes left and now Missouri is at that position they did their job defensively offensively they have got to totally eliminate 100% eliminate mistakes and move that football down the field let's just eliminate those silly penalties yeah those are the mistakes 76 yards they have got to go a field goal only ties this game they need a victory a lot of time left we got 11 with half minutes to go Lewis and down or left and they're gonna start with Wilder off the right side at the 35 36 first down Missouri runner behind Winslow Richards Lechner Haller Jones and Gunder that time Tim Fisher finally brought him down comes left Bo Holloway goes to the right Bradley spins under heat on the option keeps it and goes down at the 40 give him five yards so it'll be second in five and that was an excellent effort by Bradley though to get yardage out of something that almost dead bruised starting at him but he finally Bruce done he brought him down but not until Bradley picked up like you say for if I watch this nice move right there Bradley could have been had for about a 2yard loss did he turns it into a four yard game yeah down her and Louis both wide to the left Lewis is in the slot Bradley is going to throw he's under pressure fires back across the grain incomplete intended for Winslow and Bradley was decked again Bradley picks he's going to fire we need a short one across the middle to Winslow behind him and complete and that was all fell Bradley as he threw behind Kellen Winslow Calendar slipped right there he couldn't stop and come back for it because the field was where his feet went out from under him it was a little bit behind it was kind of a bad pass so Jeff Brockhouse has got to come in to punt his third punt of the day it will go into the wind so we anticipate that the Nebraska will be having good field position when this play is over with unless they can fumble the ball Jeff Lowe what a nice kick boy he kept that down drives Brown back Brown has no place to go now kite it up and he goes down at the 18 nobody saw the clip I'm gonna tell you no one saw the clip you gotta catch you to write and square in the back in fact it could be the guys down but I swear no one saw the clip you're making obvious reference to the official amenability drop a flag right well you can't throw a flag and I can't throw a flag but no one saw the clip 128 first and 10 for Nebraska the ball spotted at the 18 19 yard line surely gives it off the burns and burns is stacked up at the 21 a gain of two so it'll be second down and eight now garlic making the play for Missouri that was a rather lengthy delay that death could enable a lot of bodies to get kind of chilly out there couldn't it it could a lotta Lotta buy a lot of cramps oh thank you for the coffee laughter knocking off brought us some coffee I wasn't copying off I'm gonna reach my mouth as I scroll all over my body whoo second down and eight now let's see what Nebraska does offensively sorely goes back to his big running back again Rick Barnes and Rick Burns has got the first down his yardage today is unbelievable Billy Whittaker making a play I tell you they got some great blocking there on that play better than anybody I've seen in a long time it's a big first and 10 from the bracket time to stop him pitch it back to burns and that's all they're gonna do is burn turns the corner and Phil Whitaker's got a running back out of bounds at the 36 yard line same play again basically the same play again are just running them outside get them around the corner some great blocking there must be some great blocking cuz I can't believe they'd run the same play as many times as they have and we haven't been able to defensive it is the exact same play they run it left they run it right and it's a matter of a guard pulls and helps out with the blocking on that side and they are clearing the defense out on second down in three is the clock rolls nine 10 remaining in the game so Lee gives to Franklin his first man through his fullback and even Franklin runs the ball for five yards he feels good on the hands I'd like to have someone round my toes I'm thinking Oh silly would be to pour it down my back this is a first down now first and ten for Nebraska Rick burns again good job fellas cuts it back at the 50 yard line so he got seven more so it's second down in three and Rick burns continues to run up heavy weight yardage today he now has 246 yards best I guess so and now hips gonna run the football and he runs it up the gut for good yardage five more first down Nebraska 23 yards rushing but Burns has done such such an exceptional job it hasn't been able to get in the game on first down option nobody knows where the ball sir that is the wing back Ken Brown and brown has got what appears to be another Nebraska first down 11hour replaces and if they want to throw them I throw it at chipper but they're gonna keep it on the ground with hip and hip gets down to the 30 a gain of four more so it's second down and six and Nebraska is at this moment stoppable on office in the running attack pullback as brown goes in motion back I am hip and hip is taken down from behind guard up all right Ken that's the way to play it you see how they had everybody they had everybody strung up that time he had nowhere to go the end of our two yard loss I want you to watch everybody right there now they're all fighting to get outside daughter hardly shook off the block pocket era played off the block and got in the backfield now it's fourth and five and they Hart going to go boys gonna go for it they got confidence in what they've been doing they've done it so well on this Drive why not Burns is back in the game Franklin's back in the game fast play pass out complete the tight end Miller and that will be short of a first down didn't make it did not make it well this is it my friends first on Missouri coach Rowe watch it again they have got 74 yards in front of them and they are trailing by three points a field goal will not do much for them except tired they kept a Wilder and Jim Wilder gets two yards so it's second down and eight carry wine master nose guard making the plane Missouri's got plenty of time showing on the clock they've also got two timeouts left in this half let's just hammer the ball down the field pick up three or four give it to our horses Ellis and Wilder let him pick up three or four at a time hit cowling down across the middle in score Bradley's got Lewis wide to the right side Holloway is lined up left as they gifted Gary Ellis covered up Gary bangs away at the 35 and 40 sorry well I tell ya we got well we got one Nebraska player down that's what happens every time you try and every time you try and tackle Ellis or wild or somebody's might get wounded 13 yard pick off here we go look there's one tackle break two three four five that was carry wine master who is taken off the field so now at the nose guard position we will probably see a Jewess leave number sixtythree arduously oh dear I'm sorry odious leave odious Missouri first down on our Oh thirty eight thirty nine and a half yard line Bill Bradley option pitches out downer comes back and throws a block bumble and it's out of bounds it is Missouri's ball we got a few year we got five yards in that play that's pretty good play coach that's right I'll just got 156 yards rushing it second down in for Mizzou sends two wide receivers to the right side they give it straight into Wilder Wilder it's a 50 still on his feet at Jim Wilder taken down at the 47 yard line first down oh they're moving the football they have got if Missouri can score a touchdown Missouri will win this football game because I don't think Nebraska will have enough time to come back watch this watch what's Wilder we said at once we said it a thousand times the guy is just tremendous he's one of the greatest backs in the big 8 oh he was overlooked for second team or honorable mention I'll never know 163 now yards now for Jim Wilder and he's only a sophomore Bradley's got a pass he's got Winslow across the middle complete at the 2015 14 first down alright kelan there we go again the famous pass Bill Bradley to Kellen Winslow take another look at it great play we just sent Kellen down with the seam a guy sticks right there behind the linebackers in front of the defensive backs a guy that high you've got to give him some room and he means finally brought him down but not before we got to the 15yard marker how many yards we get on in 34 34 yards on that pickup Lewis end all the way to the left side Phil Bradley Jim Wilder covered up Jim at the 10 Wilder fights his way down to the 6 yard line oh I can't stand it what a football game we've got today eight yards four minutes and nine seconds left in it watch it Bob and watch it one all right I just let you look Jim Wilder follows his blockers right there follow zero game goes through let me tell you I'm telling you right now Jim while there listen to me I'm gonna buy you the biggest steak dinner you could eat Louis comes out to the left side think he's a vegetarian isn't he you see you take that man and throw him down you will not believe what wild it did he had a guy wrapped around his waist he just grabbed older and threw him into the ground like you would a piece of turf unbelievable watch this and watch Wilder closely tell you folks watch 32 watch barely handed off the street now watch this get out of my way oh I don't know how he did it too but he did a number on somebody Jim Wilder by the way has scored four touchdowns today that ties Gant's record that was that last week Brockhaus the kick a flag is down the kick is good the Incredible Hulk how's that for a name for Jim Wilder the incredible Hogan inaudible Hall I love it the penalty against Nebraska refused and Missouri 30 for the touchdown Jim Wilders fourth as we show it to you again just just just pay attention to 32 folks lights here hey boom he takes number 40 and then when it Burt Dunning makes him part of the astroturf rock house tore up it's a locket fumble car lock it and he'll kill it right there oh if only he could have kicked it out about five yards 342 left Missouri's defense hopefully prepared for the task ahead of him solely to throw it's under whoa no ray number 90 Wendell ray was there came all the way around he made Kevin Clarke eat a bunch of curl that time throw for an egg our lot Kevin Clarke your six for 275 mr. wonderful and window ray did a job on him let me tell you just some nice speed second down at 18 oh let's hold him down here make him kick fellas so Lee has got to throw the football there's no way around it this make him kick hold him down here they give the punch punch with a block but he is nailed at the 18 he doesn't quite get back to the original line of scrimmage fiveyard gain so it'll be third down and 11 yards Wendell ray again making one of the plays of merit and Ray big third down play big throws this out on top it's only the throw third down you know it's totally deep solely for locket oh wait I want to say it again locket they call inbounds that's all they need is one foot one foot in bound it's always a long pass here I thought he was gonna catch it but he finally caught oh yeah he had a foot in bounds 31 yards on the reception nice playing slowly to lock it first down Nebraska two and a half minutes remaining they still they've got 50 yards in front of them and now they send Tim Smith to the right side along with their wing back Ken Brown safety blitz fake into the line across the middle incomplete nice play intended for Brown Eric ray was going for the ball right there folks nice play by Eric Wright of course it takes away one defensive man when you do that I think it'll work another blitz are you bringing the burn Rick burns slips down at the 38 yard line but that will be in Nebraska first down look looked awful push the linemen downfield it's by Missouri it is first down for Nebraska fake into the line now it's a delay draw and they don't get anywhere Franklin gets it down to the 34 so they did get five yards and it'll be second and five as the clock shows exactly two minutes left in this game the brass time on how about an interception fumble or interception pitch it back to burn Barnes is hit and burns gets about three yards so it will be third down in two Bob we close that one down a little bit better we've been playing that one now come on get up off the field somebody's down here low floor come on window who is that okay third down and three here they go a minute 37 left and now Missouri calls the timeout Frasca Rick burns and Franklin in the backfield Long Count burns is hit his head and they did not make it who hit him first garlic hit him first first guy hit him first in the backfield then the rest of the guys came in Larry Lauderdale was a day of Hamilton's we're going to take another look at it I want you to watch Chris garlic take some meats right in the back look at here what a great play by Chris garlic it's fourth down they're going for it fourth down and four they've got to do it this if they do it defensively here the game will be over they're going to pass deep and complete Missouri takes over no Flags there are no flags on the field Vasari takes over already three seconds left Nebraska has one timeout remaining in the game they cannot stop the clock Missouri can run four plays and this football game will be over well I tell you what we got our guys in there now also gotta do we got like you say a minute three seconds they got one timeout and I would assume they're gonna use it soon well they'll use it as you're right as soon as the play is over they'll call their last timeout and that will allow about 50 seconds maybe 55 seconds left in the game and then all Missouri's got to do it all run their final three plays and the game will be over in fact they could probably do it in two irad Lee down that's one and Nebraska right there we'll call a timeout I'm swelling and older they haven't yet Nebraska has not called a timeout yet now they do I'm smelling peaches proud of us Missouri puts out two wide receivers but Bradley falls again Nebraska cannot call another timeout this football game has got one more play left in it that is it over I need to clear over stay on the clock and you can see 35 seconds left one more play and they've got it third down so Missouri actually has two more plays available to them Steve is the pit game today or not I can't really tell you for sure it's not today okay there's the last play for you the clock is counting down and Missouri has upset the Nebraska Cornhuskers final score was 335 Nebraska 31 we shall return with a final recap right after this message so please don't go away an upset over Notre Dame and then we come up with this thing and we've got an upset over Nebraska what a season it's been it's been a fantastic season for coach powers and the Missouri football team I was reading in this week's big a press release something about Missouri known as the upset team that's right of the of the century every year every year they come along and they upset somebody and today was no different they come out here they everyone thought that I'm sure the corn Husker fans thought they'd be waxed on it when the 80yard run first place got a line of scrimmage yeah but they did not give up it's a character the guys that are on that Club it's a character that the warren powers is instilled in them never to quit never to give up and he didn't and by golly they came back and just like I said at the beginning of the game they were gonna do it and he did it Jim Walter had a super day as did Rick burns but the way they ran the offense the way the defense played when the defense had to play that way is what is important right it was there was ups and downs this was definitely I think you could you could say you know realistically this was definitely when the score is 35 to 31 it's an offensive date but the defense of both defenses rose to certain occasions and played well at times played spotty at time offense the same thing but when it counted they scored and when they had to score this just like this last Drive where they came down and scored and they weren't to be tonight and like you said Jimmy Wilder there's four touchdowns tied zero game for four yeah piece that's the kind of year it's been it has been a it's been a fun season and I'm glad we had the opportunity to work together I've really enjoyed it maybe we'll have one more well I hope so I hope we go to the Peach Bowl and before Tom Maguire shuts me up here I I hope I want to take this opportunity to thank you Steve Bassett and Tom McGuire and mr. Ralph Hansen the general manager of KTVI TV back in st. Louis for giving me the privilege of doing the color commentator I leave for you guys this year I really enjoyed it and I hope that I did a respectable job for you you did a super job and we had a lot of fun by the way I like that I tell you what this is not help I am so cold that it's not the camera jumping up and down it is me again 35 to 31 was the final score and we'd like to also thank mark friend our pilot and Thunderbird aviation for making all of our travel arrangements and getting us to Lincoln Nebraska they have been super all season long and we thank them very much again 35 31 a major upset Missouri beats Nebraska and so",

of excitement temperatures 35 degrees it's clear and it's funny that if they can win today they win the national championship then Notre Dame errs no that if they win they'll have a possibility of winning the national championship in the scramble of the polls that would follow so to find out about Notre Dame let's check in now with Paul Hornung well Lindsey it sure isn't electric this whole cotton ball is just erupted for Notre Dame the whole key to the ball game is try to control the quickness of Texas Texas is a much quicker football team on offense quarterback Joe Montana will undoubtedly go to his allamerican tight in big Ken McAfee there he is from Brockton Massachusetts and Lindsey he even looks a little like rocky marciano dundee six foot five and a half 255 pounds a surefire number one draft choice he will be double covered all day long by the Texas defense and as far as the defense for Notre Dame is concerned another another guy who will receive double coverage his number 89 Ross browner a consensus twotime allamerican and he's got the job at defensive length in to try to stop Earl Campbell and nobody has done it yet finally who knows about the Longhorns is Paul Alexander he is the host of Coach Frederick as week on television show about the longrange bomb well Lindsay a popular song around Austin right now might be what a difference a year makes you know the story last year this ballclub was 5 5 and 1 and also ran in the Southwest Conference and now they're playing for the national championship certainly coach Fred Akers has had a lot to do with it but two guys in particular need to be pointed out to you first of all you know this guy the Heisman Trophy winner number 20 Earl Campbell he's gained 1744 yards this year that six point five every time he touches the ball defensively the Outland Trophy winner number 77 Brad share his coaches say he is the finest defensive lineman Texas has ever produced and when you talk about guys like Scott Appleton and Tommy nobis etc that is high praise indeed this is going to be fun Texas a Notre Dame in the 19 a cotton ball now let's take a look at the field following the custom of the Southwest Conference the Cotton Bowl Classic will be opened by a prayer followed by the national anthem song by the Crusader choir from the Highland Park Presbyterian Church of Dallas Raja McMurran director

them do it with the expertise to which were accustomed because of the very best in the world at what they do today we're going to see the very talented amateurs in football and what might be a truly championship game you're going to hear the difference between yesterday and today in the color the excitement the intensity and the noise is going to be an awful lot of go irish and hook them horns and eyes of Texas are upon you and shake down the thunder from the sky both clubs of course think they can win the Irish have been penned up in a motel in Dallas since the 23rd of December they're mean and laundry and ready to tear everybody apart Texas supporters love to point out the fact that Pope Paul this Christmas was seen giving us Christmas blessing in the following manner at any rate we expect a very exciting and wonderful football game here today at the end of which we could have a true national collegiate champion unless of course Notre Dame wins in which case they'll give the title to Ole Miss all right Jack Whittaker the captains are at the center of the field that's Paulson will be the referee the captains and officials association that worked this cotton ball game classic of 1978 I want to introduce my fellow officials this is the back judge Arnie Paul can't help is your line Judge Phil Leonard who's your empire Bill Blackburn the linesman and John Schroeder who's the field judge ok will allow Notre Dame the visiting team and as I have it here coach or coach has requested it captain browner call the toss is that right want it understood if I drop it off throw it up again this being heads and this being tails sorry call it in the air please I did call tails if you understand that Texas and its heads you might kick the receiver defend either go okay you'll receive okay round this way I'm sorry about that have Notre Dame will kickoff Texas will receive there are the officials they are from the big 8 conference bad scarfs on the referee whom you heard the captain Jews are protectors Rick Campbell James Copeland and Shira one Notre Dame Urich Orsini browner and Frey they've gone back for their final Huddle's fight about a final Longhorn comment Paul Alexander yeah I was talking with Longhorn offensive coordinator Bobby Warmack this morning on the phone and if you think Texas is a grinded out football team three yards in a mouthful of nylon you may be in for a surprise they expect to throw up to 20 times today in fact he indicated that what they would like to do is go deep to Olympic spreader Johnny lamb Jones preferably on the first series if they throw 20 times they left a very athletic director Darrell royal Paul Hornung looking to that key right away as Paul said and they coaches say they're going to try to go to lamb Jones in the first series a place is that very very important of course is the world's fastest football player he can fly and if they stick to that playaction pass lamb Jones will have mantoman coverage in the second area we might see the bomb right the first replay Dave Rieff will kick it off he is from Bloomington Indiana dropping back you see Jenkins number two dropping back along with lamb Jones the manifold fall learning to smoke he recently ran 100 meters at 9:25 was an Olympic sprinter on the relay team of course lamb Jones and he can fly and offensive boards make the most of him he's talking clearly Jackson Alfred Jackson his team made a marriage weave and the Cotton Bowl game will be underway the whistle of Carlton and here we go listen dear ma'am George moves after he has it at the fire man goes to the town hands it off on the river it was Randi Harrison who made the tackle giving off to Johnson he is the safety man the punt returner Johnny Johnson who also can fly the long hands having first intended their on 11 yard line they were trying to surprise the Notre Dame special teams right away Texas ran a lot of reverses on kickoffs last year but to my knowledge that's the first time they've tried it this season the back five the galician oh they're bringing it to him the kitchen then you get off for rural Campbell who else and early gets up to the 14 yard line for three it'll be second and seven Jeff Weston and to make the tackle for Notre Dame there's the Notre Dame defense browner Dyke goalie Calhoun and fries I'm backers Hyneman Becker and the defects Bradley Bergman on the corners Jim browner and rest assured EEP second down flake we both run the beer and the iformation of candy affirmation not mrs. Campbell leader line and that was all Bob Coley was in that America Lindsay Texas may have to open it up there is a little bit of a fiscal mismatch up front Notre Dame much bigger than Texas so maybe pounding away is not going to get it I mentioned at the top of the show fall that is quicker no question about that now the average offensive line for Texas Avenue about 232 in the average defense for the Irish would go about 245 clear down in five yards to go home for Texas Neil Harris play action off severe holds the linebackers with the fake and the teacher was for the number 82 Gil Harris is tight in all the way stop by Joe Cressy old Gil's a sophomore from Longview he's not really renowned as a receiver he's kind of small for a tight end is only caught eight passes this year but he's a good clutch receiver as you see there where he's down in ten yards to go in the vault across the 35 yard line right David Annika I tell you he runs like a truck inside and like a thoroughbred outside he's got it all straight handoff off the left side behind good blocking brick England and George James on the left side and you see Campbell doing what he can do best he slides outside and he's tough to bring down super block by Ingram wasn't it as a matter of fact he had a knee injury all year long Paul and coaches warned him to snap this year's the red shirt but he decided no way I'm missing this second down of the yard gonna throw it and going on the Jackson birthmark robbery income 45:10 Kurt Meyer not as quick as both the flankers here it is playaction he faked it the Earl Campbell now they've got a matchup of Alfred Jackson against Ted Burke pie and McEachern just comes up a little bit short good job with coverage that time by burgmaier the Texas coaches say they have all the respect in the world for that guy to the right side Notre Dame is recovered at 4:31 the football la strada and he calls his advantage watch the quickness of cross browning on the outside now he got the outside position caused the bad pitch by the teacher and he goes in and gets the football halt American Ross browner doing his thing his eloquent look out fancy forced that pitch first down and ten for Notre Dame outside the 31 yard line five receivers left and right only heavens as a running back that's Weimer across in motion Vegas fractions with the 30 picked up a yard it'll be second down and nine years ago the Texas defense stacked them up after 30 as a Texas offensive line of the Notre Dame offensive line poliansky Huffman using McDaniel I'm Tyler Ferguson heavens in the backfield receivers me and McAfee and Weimer at the 30 yard line nine yards to go then complete down the left sideline oh he was there they were trying to cover him oneonone with Derek hatchet Derek's got nine for speed himself but the that step moment the intended receiver that's what I was gonna say let's eat Tom Dolman there's your defensive line for Texas and it's a good been very very quick bones Sheeran but Mike but Michael and Campbell Tim Campbell's the brother of Earl Campbell Copeland Martin Tony and Sun lion are the linebackers hatchet Blackwood Johnson Richland are the deep men Montana driving try to hit me it's on the crossing pattern it doesn't matter Lee Hanson County Johnson bring on the pudding in it now for a Notre Dame no offense notredame is gonna be much bigger that's where they stack up a lot larger they're touching with Texas defense it's much quicker Montana is limping off on the far side you see Montana leaving and he is limping up the quarterback Dave Reeve the field goal man is and it is not depending in it in his day of Reeve is longest with 51 yards during the season this will be a 47 yard attempt and now we're going to get a timeout we're getting a timeout Notre Dame so the Irish is spending a timeout here in the first quarter think they want to talk it over Lindsey whether they want to go for the field goal Dave Reed is out there he said as long as it's been 51 yards he's got the wind at his back and Montana is getting attention there is no score in the first quarter with 11 minutes 41 seconds left to play it was Montana's right knees talking to Joe Eunice who is from Dallas Montana a 47yard field goal attempt for David if I find it 47yard field goal for every Notre Dame is taking a three nothing lead it's 35 seconds left to play in the first quarter looked like was going to be just a little bit short but it just creeped over the crossbar in the 12 mileperhour wind at his back he didn't get back a lot of change on that one did he not a great deal just got it over the crossbar and Dave Reeve goes to the sidelines now comes back to tee the ball up at the 40 yard line Notre Dame again will kick off the Texas that is the Notre Dame bat Jackson is back with lamb goes to receive it once again for Texas Dave Rieff will put it up and it's end over in lamb Joe two yards deep in the end zone will not run it out it's a touch back first and ten at the 20 yard line well like where Super Bowl 12 will be coming up on Sunday January 50 then it's on CBS what a matchup Lindsay the Denver Broncos the Cinderella team a professional football what a job red Miller is done against the very great football team the Dallas Cowboys ken Craig mark and comeback and ponies old teammates and of course the game will be on at 6 p.m. Eastern Time preceded by an R and a half version of the NFL today all on CBS on January 15 Texas has 100 cameras carat three times for 14 yards for Stinson at the 20yard line McEachern is the quarterback John damn just to the 15th am John any mouth quickness of Texas calling super run by Johnny ham Jones he's less publicized at Texas two running backs but this guy is good he's a junior he's been hurt his first two years watch how quick he gets in that hole and out again he's averaged 5.3 yards to carry this year and there you see why he has gotten great great speed once he breaks into the secondary and there he gets a little help from his brother Alfred Jackson downfield blocking for him also got some help right at that safety point from land Jones who sprung him 40 yards first and ten at the 40 yard line accessing notre dame territory they kitchen the quarterback they're running it out of an i formation pick up 2 to the 38 before Jeff Weston made the tackle perhaps you wonder why they call one of the Johnny Jones ham Jones and one lamb judge it is of course to distinguish them but they got that out of the names of their hometowns Johnny Hamish from hammer and Johnny lavish from Lampasas so it's Johnny lamb Jones and Johnny ham Johnson Matty like that second down and 8 yards to go those guys are quite a pair off veal they run around together and they they get a lot of mileage out of that ham brother to the rhythm Jones brothers stuff came in after two quarterbacks were injured in the Oklahoma game the 32 line watch Crowder a third and two after 30 to Texas history Darrell royal told me when this kid was a freshman that he was the best he had at that time he loves contact big how big is he they seized 220 he's bigger he's closer to 30 right now he lost some weight at the beginning of the season as many of you know he missed almost half of last season because of some recurring leg problems team positions determined that it might be that he was overweight and dropped a little weight this year he's still about 230 laying there this time to Johnny ham Jones trying to pick up the first down now it looks as though he did from here they'll get him unstack Ken Dyck made the stop and then they'll take a long look and give us the word it's a first intent for Texas surprise Paul we haven't seen Texas run the counter option yet and that's a just a big part of their offense it's always a big part and I think it'll probably probably be even a bigger part today they think that because Notre Dame pleasant place it's a reaction type deep bench that can get them going one direction and then bring the counter back the other side move it to the 27 for two it'll be second out of eight goats to go Bob goalie can to make the tackle he's an allamerican middle guard 63 244 pounder from Willow Lake Ohio where I ranked third in the nation this year against the rush on defense the only average let the offense average about 19 yards a game Russian so they've been very good against the rush but they're going to have their hands full today you're not about to push that Notre Dame defensive line around though they're just too big and talented second down and eight till the 20 yard line Becca along with Joel rustic endemic Mustafa be third and one endzone shot here and I think Notre Dame's defense is really keying number 20 that might open it up inside for this play right here Johnny ham Jones you see browner out of the picture he went with number 20 and that created the hole inside oh hey it's already got as many Canaries in the first quarter as he normally gets in an entire game first and ten placed in ten for Texas just outside the Notre Dame 16 yard line and I'm kinda made the Notre Dame Texas offensive line beginning to assert itself a little bit now they're not the biggest guys in the world upfront but there's some kind of quick and there is some experience there Texas Longhorns are driving Notre Dame's leading by three points we have eight minutes 22 seconds left in the first quarter Earl Campbell West 4700 44 yards he led the nation in rushing he led the nation in scoring he led the Longhorns run undefeated season he won the Heisman Trophy number 20 got just to the 13yard line picked up about three on the play which would make it second in seven does Becker along with Willie Frye had to stop Texas Longhorns are in the Cotton Bowl for the 16th time under Darrell royal who pushed up for 20 years they won three national championships won the Southwest Conference title 11 times Delroy retired at the end of last season he's here today as the director of athletics at the University of Exeter they are sending Jackson part of the right side number two ascending Jones part of an up side that slam that's to run it and he has got the 14 yard line it was Willie Frye who got to it and Paul look at what they were trying to do just what we were talking about just hang it up to the corner and let lamb Jones run to it but Notre Dame wouldn't buy it in the kitchen I think made a good move right there they had lamb Jones double covered everybody was covered he tried to pick it up on the ground throw down at eight yards to go they lost the yardage back to the 14 yard line this time they are sending my clock in front of the right side here and Ngati Jones Johnny this idea in fact back at the 25 yard line by Jim browner the strong safety Jim browner got claim number 33 he's the brother of Notre Dame's defense would not go for the fake here a passing situation here comes safety Flint that's prouder their strong safety coming up on the outside to sack McEachern but captain behind Livesey they've got what Russell Birk Slayton coming later the man is going to be a 42yard field goal in tempe time the ncdoublea record against 67 is a chip shot it stretch mannan at a whole ricky judgment and the score is time they have traded field goal Notre Dame 3 and Texas 3 7 seconds left in the first quarter when Notre Dame quarterback Jill Montana was hit on that first sequence he suffered a possible hyperextension of his right knee he will come back into quarterback the Irish and this next series of downs but Notre Dame is warming up its backup quarterback rusty ledge now let's go back up to Lindsey all right Don Creek it'll be Russell urks leaving who just kicked a field goal kicking off and Notre Dame has dropped back deep Steve Schmidt's along with Terry Urich to receive it Eric slated a fabulous character he is an extrovert of sorts he says that his quickness and getting the ball off can be attributed to coaching his old and he stopped at the 23yard line it is farmer and I'm failed to make the taco soit is first in 10 Notre Dame at the 23 return of 11 yards for Urich and Joe Montana does come out to quarterback the Irish during the season then forward passing he was 99 for 189 52.4% 11 touchdowns and eight in a section 11 plays on the drive 80 yards and get the ball 5:18 that's good pop but then applying back or mark and Copeland left linebacker for Texas sixfoot 205 pounds and he'll stick you Morgan so my mieze a scholar athlete me some Houston Texas he was recognized with the National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame in December in New York five minutes 40 seconds remaining to be played and the first quarter and we're in a 33 tie they've got heavens it was crossing hands at Gandhi from churchmen was covering McAfee an allamerican candidate who won the wall dekap trophy Pearson Texas and man coverage in the secondary they've got a lot of confidence in the athletic ability of the four guys they got back there so I just turned down an eight yards to go as Texas deploys the defense the wing backs they've got Dave Weimer out know wide left now dropping back Roy complete Chris hands is up at the 45 yard line it's Bedford made the stop in special it was right there but Haines hooked up but deep a hot pattern it's gonna pick up 20 yards of first down for Notre Dame good pass protection only a fourman rush here for Texas Montana set up and he hit teens on the Squarepants Bedford on the stop first down Texas 48 yard line before Johnny Johnson camera from his safety to make the stop Lindsey going into this ballgame Texas was a little bit concerned about their linebacker situation their regular middle line back to Lance stater suffered a separated shoulder in the season finale against Texas A&amp;M so weak side linebacker Mark Martin oniy has moved to the middle and freshman Robinson lines now playing the weak side Weimer is in motion across Montana it is first and ten at the 44yard line of Texas Oregon cokeman from his land back a spot made the tackle watch the guard pull here 65 that's Ernie Hughes another allamerican handoff the Ferguson he cuts back inside the block of the tackle Tim Foley for the first down it is spotted inside the 44 yard line we have four minutes 20 seconds left in the first quarter Texas three Notre Dame three that is his wing back and it was a cheat down field covering defensively dan Devine head coach of the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame second and ten at the 44 yard line it's a good thing coach Devine moved his team out of the hotel don't you think Lindsey there was hundreds of cars Texas fans singing eyes of Texas blowing her on but Dan to buy a new piece team 25 miles outside of Dallas last night for good night he had taken to the monastery the night before so they were not at the hotel where are they had been Vegas in Manatee stopped short at the 41 yard line Morgan Copeland again coming in to assist on the tackle along with Henry Williams for Texas you know Notre Dame's two offensive backs don't get a lot of publicity but Texas has all the respect in the world for them they think they're both excellent athletes and heavens in particular they're very concerned about with his size and speed it's going to be kind of tough to contain him third down and eight yards to go Notre Dame at the Texas 41 yard line complete that was means over there on the sidelines it'll be fourth and eight at the 41 yard line we threw that one away lids everybody went coverage by the second area of Texas he threw it away Joe Resta comes in to do the punting now he is also a free safety his father is the head coach at Harvard and throughout his head his high school career father never saw him play his father is here at the Cotton Bowl this afternoon this is only the third time that his father has ever seen his son play they asked me why he picked Notre Dame over Harvard he didn't go there he said I didn't want to go to football factory let's take an average 38.1 Johnny Johnson one of the great punt returners in the nation is back deep for Texas Arleen kick those out of bars to see where it's going to be lined up it's going to be on up the sidelines at the 8 yard line so Texas it's our first Intendant the Texas a good kick we are in a 33 tie here on a beautiful afternoon in Dallas Texas and we have three minutes 27 seconds left to play in the first water it's a sexist fan and what they're saying is go horns go and the horns have the wallet their own 8yard line down the fare at eight times for 33yard ham going three times with 51 yards McEachern is the quarterback gives it to Earl Campbell is Trophy winning running back who moves it up to the 14 yard line picked up six on the players be second down and four yards to go Ken Dyck from Maryville Indiana made the tackle for Notre Dame oh use a lot of straight hamburger attack with Campbell don't you understand easy to understand when you got a guy this that big and that fast he can just cut off the block and take it to him Alexander is here in my booth today he has the sports director of our CBS affiliate in Austin he does the coach's show with Fred Akers throughout the season now desert camo carrying he moves up to the 20yard line to pick up the first and ten for the Longhorns of Texas you'll notice the Texas will run a lot of the time back to the left side the reason being they have two very experienced offensive linemen on that side tackle George James and guard Rick Ingram both of whom are seniors in Cotton Bowl history the host team is 120 games the visiting team has won 17 games they have been four times Nexus since Jackson to the left side to the right side he got to the 22 fortuity second date we got burned a couple times with that little hand off the ham Jones and the Notre Dame defense on the left side played that a little tighter Notre Dame on the record of 10 and 1 they lost to Ole Miss early in the season Notre Dame cheerleaders when Paul Hornung was in school they didn't have female cheerleaders if they did to him st. Mary's across the road that has still been there they would have double close up just across the 22 yard line but Steve hi I'm Crider was there the MIDI from his linebacker spot oh hype crotte it came a long way well he did and it was no gain so it'll be third and eight Texas uses Campbell just like Chicago Bears use Walter Payton even though maybe Payton would not break a play they just keep giving the ball to him because they know the law of averages he's gonna break one and that's exactly what Texas will do with roll camera I'll keep giving the football he'll run at 2530 times average Earl Campbell one of the eleven children fumble the football and Notre Dame recovered it hit the 27 yard line he got popped Jim browner got it Jim browner another big play was right there and fell on the loose football let's pick it up good execution actually by Texas on the screen you see Campbell take everybody deep and there comes ham Jones now watch the head here he gets hit and sandwiched right there Becker was right there and Crowder has got it back another thing you have to be impressed with the Notre Dame looking all those white shirts around they really read the screen that time first to 10 outside the 27 yard line Joe Montana Scotty was his favorite target during the year when he caught 54 he took that width of the 17 this Ken McAfee he's been doubleteam two or three times is the first pass in his area he slips down but good balance gets up and he's wide over coming across the field he gets knocked down by a block by Ricky Churchill he has great hands the hands of an artist because he's an artist first and ten at the 17 yard line it was Johnny Johnson up to make the stop we are nearing the end of the first quarter we have 30 seconds remaining in this period Whammer and omen you'll see alternating that's Weimer coming into the ballgame now Ford and Divine's Fighting Irish of Notre Dame this goes to a wide helmets at the slot and now we are getting a timeout Notre Dame with 16 seconds remaining and it's a second timeout but it's been taken by Notre Dame that one coming 16 seconds before the end of the first quarter Montana wants to go over to talk to the staff we're in a 33 tie here at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas Texas this is Lindsey Nelson with Paul Hornung Paul Alexander Don Ricky Jack Whittaker at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas Texas were in the 33 tie second down nine yards to go for the Fighting Irish you have him at the Texas 16 yard line on time is 2 for 7 31 yards in the air thanks for the Fighting Irish waivers one voice on the cross Evans whiskey is at the core lives up to the six yard line got in advance of the sticks it'll be a person gold at the 6 yard line churchmen made the stop good blocking on the outside man a motion left watch Ferguson sealing off to the inside and heavens dug the rest he gets outside they needed about eight for the first down he got it easy stopped by Church with Texas middle linebacker Mark Martin Odum really cut off that time and that's something that had been a source of concern to the Longhorns he's not very experienced in the middle he's norming outside linebackers he said earlier now time has run out in the period time has run out in the period and so that is the end of the first quarter here at the 1978 Cotton Bowl game in Dallas and the score is tied Notre Dame 3 makes it it's first down and going to going to your licks in the bargain touchdown Yuri Urich took it in from the six yard line is a cool captain at Notre Dame and it's the first touchdown of the afternoon break walking off the left side they pull the guard it's a crosswalk let me outside they caught like Jefferson on the outside and Gary goes in just barely front three safety Johnny Johnson just wiped out on the play he had no chance now day of ravens in to attempt the conversion they agree from Bloomington Indiana during the year 39 for 44 and the extra point Department Resnick puts it down it's put it up and it's good and so as they come back up the field the score is Notre Dame 10 X is 3 we are early in the second quarter 14 minutes 56 seconds left it'll be a kickoff now from Notre Dame de Texas they have rave will kick off Alfred Jackson has dropped back on with lamb John puts it up Johnny laughs George from El Paso septum and everybody's at the town at the 15 stop short at the 22yard line where they'll start first intent the 1978 CBS Sports spectacular in January the world light heavyweight championship play oh and foil off and then comes the world lightweight championship Roberto Duran against Esteban DeJesus I'll tell you not too many people last with that Roberto Duran and over you the super skates and the Hollywood stuntmen competition and much much more the 1978 cbs4 spectacular ham Jones and ham Jones moves in advance off the 23yard line picked up a couple yards on the play make it second down and eight here are the first quarter stats 132 yards by Texas and they still trail in this ball game by seven points Notre Dame picked up 76 yards on the ground Notre Dame 186 total yards Texas 127 Notre Dame had the ball ten and a half minutes Texas had it four and a half minutes in the first quarter there's the story of the Pats the difference of the ballgame so far lids Jackson Kelly in and out of the hands of Greg Meyer break Meyer 18 for Jackson the intended receiver burgmaier again here they go Paul right after Berg Marv no doubt about it both wide receivers to the same side that time they think that with that kind of speed both of those receivers on the same side they can put a lot of pressure on the defense but Notre Dame would have nothing up at that time she'll be a third and eight Texas and third down conversions is three four five for the afternoon Notre Dame is leading here by a score of ten to three early in the second quarter there's something Lockett to a wide left they're bringing Jackson to a wide right babbles in the left I'm his taxes tax important first contender in Texas Luther Bradley the allamerican cornerback made the tackle for Notre Dame let's take a look at it again Alfred Jackson coming across the middle which is something Texas fans love to see because last year after he suffered some broken ribs Alfred admittedly was a little bit hesitant to come across the middle he didn't like getting hurt but look at him give himself up there he didn't care anything to get the ball and he got hurt I was going to say then see he didn't hear the footsteps era Texas players hurt that is Jackson who is down and getting attention at the 37 yard line where it is the first down for the Texas Longhorns the kitchen is 3 for 5 in the air for 36 yards so far this afternoon so Texas is trailing by 7 as you see Dan Devine along the sideline Alfred Jackson left the field under his own car its first in 10 for Texas long runs out the ball at their own 37 kitchen breaks them up now lock it's in there at the flanker damn Jones aye powers up near the 40yard line Clinton Dyke in the mix attacker lets up about three on the play to make it 2nd down and 7 two of the greatest Cotton Bowl games ever played were played between these two teams in 1970 Lexus making a bid for the national championship came into play Notre Dame Texas wanted in the closing moments and won the national championship the next year they brought a 30 game winning streak into this Cotton Bowl 1971 that day Notre Dame won so they are 1 in 1 in the Cotton Bowl this is the rubber game here this afternoon McEachern has the ball he fumbles the ball and Notre Dame recovers another turnover and it is Willie Frye on the ball it is at the 35 yard line where I got the football but watch 89 Ross browner he makes McEachern step up into the pocket he beats the block a complete mismatch with ham Jones then the teacher loses the football and Willie Frye was right there I think that was 79 ten Duyck who really caused the fumble that's him 79 but his first 210 Notre Dame Montana is under on the attack 30 yard line at the start of the season Notre Dame ran exclusively out of a Wing T later for the army game they went into an i formation use the I for most of the year that was off the wing T very frequently you'll see an orange blur coming out of the Texas secondary what that is it's a Rickey Church move just to bet it's crazy a defensive back you'd ever want to see patterns himself after another guy here in Dallas cliff Farris and it is complete taken by his big allamerican tight end McAfee outside the 21 Rickey churchmen up set it and you'll see why Kim McAfee is going to be a number one draft choice in the pros of great pair of hands playaction to the right they got McAfee isolated over here with number eight Rickey churchmen he just goes up and makes a great catch we have a correction on the stats we gave you a moment ago in the first Court of Texas total yardage 286 odor diamonds at the 22yard omen unfortunate class vegas Ferguson got about a half yard and that's all bad Sharon the Outland Trophy winner as America's outstanding line but made the tackle the year before 76 it was browner wash browner who won the Othman trophy so we have this year's winner in last year's winner on the field this afternoon see the best that ever played at Texas that's what they say but think about the companies that we're talking about Scott out from Tommy nobis John Elliott Vegas the tenon goes out of but if we push down and 10 yards to go at the 10 Johnny Johnson finally pulled him out along with Morgan Copeland I'd say Notre Dame just winning the battle the pits up there running the football it's a good hole on the right side ground level shot if Vegas Ferguson he was finally stopped by Johnny Johnson the free safety in his spot ensure that his first down and goal to go at the 10 yard line right there back in the slide and motion across that's Weimer Oh heaven I rather Urich that is uric your it cook it in uric had come in their throwback and he scores his second touchdown of the day hearing Urich singing their running back in cocaptain Notre Dame fans are going crazy or a lot of them here watch the blocking on the left side the same exact play Lindsey this time here it goes outside he scores his second touchdown of the day he scored on the same play from for four or five yards out for his first touchdown conversion attempt coming now they agreement under attempted they moved 35 yards in five plays after recovering the Texas waffle Joel rustic will hold it's and it's good and for the score if wondered am 17 and Texas 3 we have 11 minutes 37 seconds remaining to be played in the first half Johnny lamb John's back to receive the kickoff he's known as the world's fastest football player because he was on the United States Olympic gold medal relay team and the other three don't play football and as they areif to kicking off a Notre Dame he's at the 15 20 concen gone field the premiere of challenge of the sexist returning to trendy January 8 at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time on CBS that's the exciting man versus woman anything you can do I can do better for Matt and it's Virginia way the reigning Wimbledon champion against Vitas Gerulaitis one of the best tennis players in the world mana wanna ski trick job and a motorcycle jumpoff and don't forget the NBA Sunday 22 Ken Dyck made the tackle for Notre Dame lindseyandpaul we ought to point out at the stage this is certainly not the first time this season Texas has been behind they were behind against a.m. against Houston even against SMU back here in the Cotton Bowl last October so they're not about to panic admittedly they have not been 14 down before but you won't see them deviate from their game plan too much was trying to get it handed off apparently to Campbell Jim browner was in there to make the stop and back here also on to tackle as McEachern kept the football and there is no gain on the play third and seven at the 23 yard line it's the third time this year the Texas had played in this stadium the Texas owe you game is always played here they defeated Oklahoma here first time they've been Oklahoma in six years they played SMU here this is the third time in almost like a home game gonna have to go outside a little bit Lindsey they're gonna have to start using that counter option and try to get Campbell to the outside fifteen Ross browner and Willy fry the bookends met well Ross browner had 18 sacks on the year just a complete domination upfront right here by the Irish defense McEachran doesn't have a shot here here comes prouder and there's fry that'll bring on the fun again putting in it nuts Russell Eric's Levin who averaged forty five point nine and his longest was 71 yards against Oklahoma Lin see he'd have won the national championship but he didn't pun enough times to qualify for his goal line Vincent Bourg Mayer a deep hits across the 15 rows out of bounds on burgmaier side no return at the 40yard line first and ten go now Notre Dame gets the ball in good field position they get it first since in at their own 40 in his Notre Dame 17 section three a 45yard punt we have a report from the Notre Dame sob on the Joel ristic who is the free safety the punter and the holder for placements and the knee injury and may not be back this afternoon Notre Dame has the ball our first antenna breaks him up in an ayah formation pictures taken the quarter trick Saskatchewan where's Benton great turnover for Texas in fact this is Notre Dame's first turnover and they went for the bomb he had a step on the man in patch it just makes a great interception hatchet is so quick that he can give up a step and still recover he's probably Texas his best defender in terms of mantoman coverage they will always put him on the other team's best wide receiver the receiver day of Weimer were shaken up for Notre Dame but left under his own power you're looking at the Texas sideline now as the Longhorns have the football at Texas Texas have had three turnovers and Notre Dame has converted them all into points Randy Harrison's playing rustics free safety now for Notre Dame after John Hamm George moved it up to the 25yard line in the two yards on the plan we get second down on eight yards to go for the Longhorn to the University of Texas you know Lindsey so far we haven't said anything about Texas quarterback Randy McEachern but he's quite a story if you probably know he was actually Longhorns third team quarterback going into the season but after both the Marten Macbeth and later John Arne both went down with leg injuries in the Oklahoma game right here in the Cotton Bowl McEachern was pressing the service and what a job he's done I know what he was last year he was a spotter for the radio announcer it's second down and eight guards gamble is Karen for the 29yard line Bob Dole II in to make the tackle it'll be third down and four yards to go 37 seconds left to play in the first half it's gonna say so far the yards that Earl Campbell is coming by are very very tough yards they are really swarming Notre Dame defense it's been outstanding so far in this first half third and fourth McEachern on his steps Becker has it 20 yard line Lindsay the game planned for Notre Dame is working beautifully they were hoping to get Texas in a flowing situation and just hope that McEachern would try to throw it up for grabs and Doug Becker makes the fourth turnover for Notre Dame here in the first half James made the tackle here it is the keator steps up he's trying to throw a little pattern to he's tight in Gil Harris named persons in at the Pyxis pushing across from the wing back that's Weimer at the 17yard line right honey the middle linebacker made the tackle in three yards on the play at second down and seven getting back to the interception a few seconds ago you'll notice that so far most of the teachers passes instead of the drop back variety that's not normally his game he's really a much better roll out faster they've got Chris Haynes part of the left side they've got going as a wing back right running back to evened up Montana Montana well it was McAfee for whom it was intended just getting rid of it his third and seven at the 17 yard line Joe Montana who came off the bench in the Purdue game to bring Notre Dame from behind and has been quarterbacking them ever since two years ago he came off the bench against North Carolina came off the bench against the air force to lead Notre Dame to victories he missed last year with his shoulder separation Joe Montana Montana says he was most that's the number 12:45 or cobol that's just a story I'm Connor strewing and it's in the ends of tricks now Vegas Vegas Vegas Ferguson clicks pound motor day everything storing light for the Arts Joe Montana he's got the quickrelease he's going to be a fivefold quarterback he's a good drop back watch high stance right there under pool rush now watch the bow just come back right tooth Ferguson a great catch Martin only the middle linebacker covering the halfback deep situation with bus you know you hear it so many times with the quick back isolate both the middle linebacker Marconi just couldn't make the blow conversion of tip coming now it's going to be burgmaier holding instead of rustic there's after the injury and we boots it up and it's good here in the second quarter with 7 minutes 28 seconds left it is Notre Dame 24 and Texas 3 now let's talk a little bit about the national championship the Longhorns the only major undefeated untied team they came out of Lebanon all knowing that if they could win here today they'd win the national championship but what if Notre Dame went well that simply means that we will have a host of once defeated teams there'll be two playing in the Orange Bowl that means it'll only be one when that's over Oklahoma and Arkansas are there Penn State has already finished there once defeated Alabama's the Sugar Bowl there once defeated Notre Dame will be once defeated so it'll be left up to the polls as the AP that the UPI as the Football Foundation Hall of Fame there's a football right here take good joy I'll tell you one thing let's see if Notre Dame continues this is a very surprising story the first death you'll see a lot of index fingers raised on those white jerseys they think they should be number one that they can hold on they every aim is putting it up coming to Jackson side of the field Jackson at the 11 yard line Alfred Jackson to the 20 25 he gets to the 30 yard line Willie Oh strike first and 10 will televise the final Raj at the Grand Prix masters from Madison Square Garden in New York the field of eight headed by here Mobius Jimmy Connors and be on board in the first prize and that would live he's only 100 big ones thought that might get your attention the Grand Prix master sent his championship on CBS 1st down and 10 yards to go for the Longhorns of Texas at the 30 yard line we tend to count 32 for twothree second may 30 to Raj Crowder and Bob go Lake made the time thus far you've really got to hand it to that Notre Dame defense they've given Campbell nothing into the yards that he has gained they've all come tough you know we get too caught up in statistics sometime but one very interesting statistic is that up to 1700 yards that Earl gained this year 1100 of them came after he was hit once second tonight the kitchen brings him up my clock it's mark where's the locket incomplete incomplete pass Jim Brown I was covering its third down an eighth goes to go up to 32 yard line Mike losses concentration that time he's a sophomore out of Fort Worth he runs probably the best patterns on the team he was a starter earlier in the year had some physical injuries was not you know out of the lineup for a while still get to play quite a bit got a good pair of hands but didn't look the ball in that time I was going to say maybe a 21point lead may get Texas out of their game plan I think if they do that Paul they're in trouble they've got to stick with what they do best is trying to run the football then throw and it's complete across the 50yard line they can buy Gil Harris Takeda and Jim browner made the tackle pushed in 10 for Texas super catch by Gil Harrison's time watching this go forward and find the scene in between the corner and the safety great catches we said earlier he's not known as a receiver but you could never tell about watching that one I'm sure you were aware that there was a lot of emotion involved in the crowd reaction to the announcements made Johnny Jones Garrett the hog rider in to make the tackle second down in five yards to go at the 45 yard line that is Johnny lamb Jones coming back onto the field out rocket is coming off we have 5 minutes 54 seconds remaining to be played in the first half Jackson is going to the left side Johnny lamb coach is going to the right side damn Jones and Campbell in the I formation for McEachern Sophie went down to the 27 yard line first in Denver zexal that's low horns President Bush and they need to have Earl Campbell sparked his football team Paul this may help Earl Campbell showing what he can do the best he goes inside or outside Randy you'll notice that was out of the I formation and that's a formation that Texas will go to more and more the more they're in trouble they think they lie to roll up seven yards deep given that much momentum he's kinda hard to stop of all back to the 25yard line picked up about to to make it second denieth there and Mike Calhoun came in to make the tackle for Notre Dame Notre Dame 24 Texas three five minutes remaining to be played in the 1978 Cotton Bowl game in Dallas Texas Texas need to put a touchdown on the board before the second half starts this Drive very very important for Texas momentum I would say Paul they need to put some points on the board in a hurry this is surprising first half if you believe number one ranked team would be behind by 21 laughs now for Texas and this is Campbell again up to the 22 yard line picked up three will be third and five Bob Golic the middle guard made the tackle that's an 18th carry for girl Campbell here in the first half he's got about 80 yards rushing this looks like one of those 30 carry busy afternoon swirl third down and five yards to go here comes lock it back into the ballgame they she's coming out for Texas like it's going to a wide level any backs to split kitchen go lock it little low and incomplete now let's go down to Don quickie let's go to dine quickie well we didn't go down to dog shall we go down to dine cranky later didn't have a nice Cody as on one Paul Hornung yet took care of a man keeping warm down there on his satellite mark slavin is under a company logo keep in mind he's booty one 467 yards it's going to be churchmen holding for him and this will be a 39 yard attempt Jim browner that's it at the 5yard line and it's just stood there for a moment and finally scattered over across not knowing that a block cut can be advanced he's elected to simply try to dive into sort one extra point this bowl just poorly kicked by work slave and as you'll see just a very low trajectory on the ball the protection really pretty good pretty good as you see was just kicked very poorly Russell missed the last two games of the regular season with a leg injury and perhaps is following him now and here's Jim browner going after the football he thinks it's a dead football but Notre Dame has it inside their own tan at six first and ten for the Irish at the six yard line Joe Montana still quarterbacking this is Vegas Ferguson Vegas Ferguson gets it up there just short of the 9 yard line clock is running with three minutes 35 seconds left to play in the first half Notre Dame is leading Texas 24 to 3 it'll be second down at 7 yards to go right Nonie Hamilton and there for Texas at least five number one draft choices in this football game at least 5 and 1 Pro general manager Tony 7 in this game today taken there by heavens and he moved it after the 20yard line this good blocking at the point of attack right there a little cross walking right in the middle and they get the middle linebacker or a standoff in Heaven's cuts for daylight picks up the first down we invite you to stay with us during the halftime intermission will have the Notre Dame band the Texas band the Kilgore Rangerettes in their back line motion across from the wing back that's Weimer heavens but the Texas defense stacked him up when okay let's go down now to Don Ricky Lindsey I just talked with Joe rustic the Notre Dame free safety as you pointed out is out of the lineup right now it's unlikely he'll play again this afternoon he has a contusion of his right thigh and it's tightening up on he has difficulty walking let alone running of course he's a very instrumental part of Notre Dame's attack and that he is a putter and as a physician putter young sophomore Kevin you know we'll probably cannon for him Quincy alright Don so I can in ten at the 20 yard line for Notre Dame Vegas Ferguson got three yards to the 22 where it'll be third down at 8 yards to go Ferguson getting up slowly the lacquer was in to make the tackle for Texas as you know in college football there is no twominute warning but we have two minutes remaining to be played in the first half Lindsey know minute ago we were talking about the trouble Texas was having with their linebackers look who's playing the middle now mark Alton and Martin Tony has been moved back to the each side third I'd play coming Octopussy just across the 30yard line caught him in the weakside blitz this is Glenn Blackwood number 37 he's giving hane so much room Montana right there got off the pass after being rushed good pass by Montana to the circumstances Haynes has got it very close for the first down they gotta bring the chain all the way across and measure at the sideline for the possible first down Vance Carlson the referee and it's a first in ten over they should be able to run the talk out now for the first half Notre Dame has broken its record for the alltime team receptions with 164 in offense during the course of the year was pretty well divided best to body cooler running that's against passing 135 to play in the first half Notre Dame is leading 24 to three is up to the 40 that good speed and he gets to the 46 yard line Ricky churchmen made the tackle first and 10 Notre Dame at their own 46 boy heavens makes a real good move on Glenn Blackwood the right corner back here roll out draw we got to stand off and then Kevin's breaks to the outside right there Glendon Blackwood should have made the tackle but heavens made a good move on him Kevin's now 49 yards and 7 carries when he had 994 during the season miss being a thousand yard rusher by only six had only ones I might honest throwing hay is going to come back and incomplete he trouble it underneath his body incomplete second and 10 at the 46 yard line Glenn Blackwood again Glenn is the brother of lau Blackwood of the Baltimore Colts and Lindsey I think if they're going to go to the air looks as if Glenn Blackwood is giving the Notre Dame receivers a little too much room out there Paulie almost has to he doesn't really have a lot of speed and he's not the biggest guy in the world either what he does have is a lot of finesse and he is a very very tenacious athlete Goldman's going to a wild right chris hayes to a wild love for Notre Dame there knife formation Montano repeats and has the ball Montana strong diploma and it's incomplete a hatchet was the man there number three who was trying for the interception third and ten Notre Dame at their own 46 the information stops the clock 1:11 remaining in the first half artificial turf here at the Cotton Bowl installed after a couple of teams in 1970 tore the field up in the mud a couple of teams named Texas and Notre Dame so artificial turf was installed at the time one set back now or never Evans Jerome heavens to the 43 I think he got the first down enzone shot here of heavens Notre Dame quickly couldn't call timeout here now they're thinking at least three heavens just Pixies whole beautifully and he comes up with the big first down for the Irish super block by the Irish Center uh Dave Huffman on middle linebacker Mark Hamilton I hate to keep harping on this but Texas is getting hurt in the middle of and of course from Dallas Texas dropping back is Montana throwing incomplete you can man you only have to have one foot in in college and Montana was right on the money see if we could pick it up my antennas got all the time in the world to throw the football great pass protection this is Haynes great camera shot here looked like he had his foot in there offer free a judgment call Texas felt very strongly going into the game if they had to put an effective pass rush on Montana to contain him and thus far they haven't gotten near him 46 seconds left to play in the first half Notre Dame three Montana throwing two mcafee in completed passes the ruling turn at the 43yard line incidentally Jerome happens now has 2013 2 year career yards rushing at Notre Dame pretty good stick that time by Johnny Johnson coming up from his free safety position he's a sophomore from Lagrange Texas and he was one of the most highly sought after high school players in the state a year ago Vegas Ferguson just came back into the ball game Tom Dolman all committing in his way low went out this is a big third in my money Mike Martin on he got to him immediately at the 49 yard line yeah marks a little frustrated and he's taking out some of that anxiety as you'll see he's back at his weak side linebacker in position now I started the game in the middle in place of the injured Lance Taylor he kind of got chewed up out there but he's back home now and somebody's got to pay for it they say miss Lance Taylor he was the number one tackler for Texas all year long and a great super athlete he of course has to miss this ballgame because of the separated shoulder that he sustained and the Texas A&amp;M game and now it's gonna be me you know and to do the kicking Kevin you know we'll do the putting with rustic out of the ballgame for Notre Dame you know is from Los Angeles California he's a sophomore well we wanted to find punt return men in America dropping back Johnny Johnson this is gonna be a treat this guy's return 44 punch this year which is an alltime Texas record he's a return iment about 12 yards a clip which ain't too bad and many times when he drops back there the Texas ban will strike up the Tonight Show theme and go here is Johnny took one what 52 yards back against Virginia he's very dangerous Devon you know in deep punt formation with 28 seconds remaining in the first half 24 Texas 3 I try to block it got to they're rushing ten you know puts it up high and short there'll be no return it is out of hours at the 32 yard line it was a 19 yard putts when we first intend out for Texas see what they can do in the remaining 22 seconds in this half and again we invite you to stay with us during the halftime in a mission when we'll be entertained by the Notre Dame band the Texas band the Kilgore College ban and the Kilgore Rangerettes Rockets going to a wired left going to set in the slot left Rambow sure to the 42 and I think he's got the first down when they fry I made the tackle notredame in a prevent defense now three down lineman Texas quickly calls timeout 15 seconds to go 20:43 very surprising here in the first half Notre Dame's defense has kept Texas from the end zone and Texas ranked third in the country in scoring just under 40 points again this is a charge Texas timeout the Cotton Bowl record incidentally four runs from scrimmage is 95 yards it was taquile go for rice against Alabama in the 1954 game and that has stood up through the years you had the Cotton Bowl in Dallas did you see that one from this booth I saw that one this very booth this booth is just like it was there congratulations falling harder for our ball sitting to the left Lindsey Nelson the voice of the cop 18 years this is Lindsay's 18th Cup I'll tell you what just hanging around him this week here in Dallas has been a lot of fun incidentally here's a halftime score that'll interest you at the end of the first half alabama 13 ohio state nothing and the Sugar Bowl what he's not going to like that he's not gonna like that at all Dan Devine they head coach and they're going to try to have a few words with down Devine as his team needs to feel here in just a few seconds first lieutenant the 25/8 second time the clock they called timeout immediately stop it they claim for the Texas Longhorn t1 on that board once again Paul and Lindsay this is exactly what they've been trying to do all day long just the streak pattern the lamb Jones and nobody's gonna streak with him what they're trying to do is get a oneonone situation between lamb and the strong saftey Jim browner because quite frankly they think browner is the weak link in the Texas secondary all right over Notre Dame secondary I might have pulled a hamstring he's being helped off and they need his speed in the second half being down by 21 those sprinters are very very delicate animals and I guess when your hamstrings are strong my kids are uh doesn't take much to throw him out of whack let's see if we can pick it up Paul he goes up and turn back to the ball and that's proud of what caused it right there right there he pulled it after about the first couple of steps he had definitely didn't hold on to his left side no doubt a bad left hamstring 34 yard pickup on the play will identify the pause we're hearing a lot of Paul's hear that Paul Alexander in this Paul Hardy Paul Alexander from Austin of course as the host of coach Fred Akers show he sports director of our CBS morning is from Louisville Kentucky and other points Louisville's my home price Denton at the 25yard line McEachern putting it seems incomplete he headed just for a moment that is Bradley covering Jackson had it just for a second it's an incomplete pass I'll say one thing about Texas they're passing offense it's just go for the home run they don't fool around with little turn ins and turn outs they throw it to their speed men Jackson had the football right in his hands could not hold on difficult catch admittedly but he's the kind of guy that's been making just that kind of catch all year long it's worth the stage right now where Texas really needs it animations come back into the ball game now for Texas in his second down to Tennessee five two seconds on the clock two seconds remain played him the first time for the 1978 Cotton Bowl Makita time has run out incomplete hold it hold it there's a flag it's going to be against Jim browner there is a flag it's going to be against the strong safety on Notre Dame's defense the clock had run out but the game the halftime will not end on a penalty I not end on a defensive foul and so now officials are in conference and that is mass Carlson this year that's an offense Notre Dame pushed down first down for Texas wears down on the pass that is spotted at the 30yard line forget the field behold they're going for their gun is gone for it to try to get a touchdown on the board they're trailing 24 to three they get this play time has run out on the clock but they get this play out in the period on a defensive foul now Notre Dame calls a timeout Notre Dame has called a timeout what's happening Doug Becker the defense of Catherine who calls the play he's on his way over to talk to George Kelly and Dan Devine over there Kelly who handles the defense from up here in the press box and I'm sure they're gonna go over a little strategy right there Joey Ianto there's laughter Nash Fred Akers talking to his quarterback McEachern Fred Akers of course almost everybody's coach of the year in his first year at Texas he played his college football at Arkansas he was a great high school coach and then came to Darrell royal staff he went out to Wyoming coach two years in Wyoming last year that his team as Co champions of Western Athletic Conference in the Fiesta Bowl where they were rolled over by Oklahoma but then he went to Texas he ditched the wishbone but in the veer his I told Earl Campbell to get from 235 down to 220 and he hasn't been here undefeated I think that was the first penalty this fall game yes it was the first penalty the ballgame coming as time runs out giving Texas one more shot to throw it up in the end zone so in Texas has decided on the strategy they will employ this is one play strategy Malcolm Jackson coming wide to the right side and that's where it's going gun like rocket for the touchdown I like that for one play well this this championship and Texas this fight to set requirement half pad locket right over the middle on a post pattern double cover he holds on to the football from McEachern good throw right on the money and Mike raucous and Sid was a very heralding receiver in high school and he's earned his keep right there gets the horns back in the ballgame Andy Harrison was there to make the stop we have a conversion attempt coming out works late down irks Laban boots it up its birth and so that is the end of the first half and the score is Notre Dame 24 and Texas 10 both scream for the title now both teams dreaming for the tunnel as Texas scores on the last play of the first half to cut the lead it is noted in 24 and Texas taking an early lead but Texas having stormed back here and the closing moments of the period psychologically Lindsay I think that's going to be a great boost for the Texas Longhorns I got to go in that locker room let's go down to Don crickey all right here is Dan Devine Dan there was a dramatic comeback by Texas late in that second quarter well they have a team with a lot of pride on and we were afraid that they would do that that's a good play by Texas we had man coverage in the Blitz on and they got the ball off and got a great key score I know coming into the game you and your coaches and your players were very confident about beating Texas did you expect it to be like this had to have well we weren't very confident Don we felt we'd worked hard and we had a good football team we know Texas is number one and a lot of ball to be play get this half I think it's going to be a great football game we've got to kind of regroup ourselves now we have the lead with Texas has a momentum another great college I think everybody's gonna stay tuned good luck thank you Dan Devine the coach of Notre Dame now let's go back up to Lindsey Nelson all right Don Ricky it's halftime here and we're ready for the halftime pageantry and this is the Fighting Irish band Notre Dame the Notre Dame band of the Fighting Irish is under the direction of Robert O'Brien assistant directors of James Phillips and Reverend George wiskirchen Notre Dame band will perform the most famous circus March ever Carla kings Barnum and Bailey's favorite it's halftime here at the Cotton Bowl Notre Dame is leading by a score of 24 to 10 the Notre Dame band is on the field Notre Dame is leading Texas my score of 24 to 10 as the teams start to come back on the field Texas knowing that they've got to come from behind if they are to win and win with it undisputed possession of the national championship they'll lay claim to the national championship we have one more half of great football coming between Notre Dame and Texas but a great halftime show and I think we're going to be in for us another half of great football is I guess a difference in this football game has been the turnovers Texas will have four turnovers in the first half and Notre Dame put 24 points on the board the captains now at middle after middle of the field Texas fight Texas won the title have another name we'll get their choices down I'll restate I turn around this way please okay Notre Dame then chooses resaved shaytan's I think men we're about ready to go alright let's go down nodded on crickey hi Lindsey here of course is the coach of the Longhorns Fred Akers Fred your team twice this season came from behind against highly ranked team to Oklahoma and Arkansas can you do it again in this game well we're getting ready to find out that's exactly what we're gonna try to do we're not a team that quits I know that when you come out of your game plan it all fromor now we're gonna do just what we plan to do when we start all right coach Fred Akers let's go back up Lindsey all right Don as we start the second half Notre Dame 24 Texas ten Dan divine along the sideline better to send the Irish back onto the field Terry Urich is back there was three Schmidt's to receive the second half kickoff Russell Birk Slavin will kick it off for Texas heat up on the 40 he might kick between the sofas from there just in case he does if there's not count as a field goal this is a kick off 24 to 10 Notre Dame is leading as we fight the second half which Raven is waiting for the wisdom of referee bats bouncing start falling on there this down into the endzone Urich will not run it on touch back first and ten at the 20 yard line you know Lindsay if I were going to guess there's a first half statistics you actually Texas out game Notre Dame over 50 yards because we were talking about those four turnovers and spend the difference in this ballgame with Joe Montana at quarterback I think Freddy Akers had to tell his Texas team at halftime Paul this is the most important defensive series for us right now we've got to stop motor named hole good field position consent some other things to charge out to the 22nd to the second and for Ricki churchmen up from his strong safety to make the tackle along with Mark Martin honey Paul and Lindsay this Texas team is a very emotional ballclub they're also an extremely close team you always get the feeling being around and they genuinely like each other and they take the situation very very personally look for them to pull together a yard chart of the first John at the 29 where it will be third and one Steve McMillan to make detect McMichael in to make the tackle for Texas there's a quarterback comparison first half for future six out of 12 107 Montana 6 for 17 56 yards both threw for one touchdown again the turnovers the difference third down and a yard to go and the Texas defenses but it's a first in town as your room heavens picked it up just across the 30foot Notre Dame it was Johnny Johnson up from his free safety can make the tackle because I'll also guess what Dan Devine said at halftime and he said boys we've got 30 more minutes of football you've got a two touchdown lead if you want the national championship go get it Notre Dame 24 Texas 10 early in the third quarter Ron its Vegas Ferguson lunch for a couple yards up there to the 37 yard nine will be second in three Copeland and Martin Loney made the stop and they're controlling the line of scrimmage right here you see Huffman with a great block right took the man the Noles guard and made he good block Ferguson keeps his balance here running Vegas Ferguson the wrong heavens and heavens is up there at the 45yard line the first intent huffman is just controlling hark amateur right now being the center of Notre Dame and Mark Hamilton landing head up right on his nose Hamilton's is senior from New Mexico he hasn't logged a lot of playing time this year as we said earlier he's been pressed into service because Texas is having trouble in the middle it's short in the 45yard line heavens gets up to the 49 yard line we took about five where to be second in five Martin Tony again in to make the tackle will they find a piece of meat they chew on it don't say they're coming back and handles him again and again and again why not a little weakness and that has to mean that they've comfortable junior out of Dallas doing a good job at center always those begun Furguson runs into get to the fix and I think he got it first in ten for Notre Dame they have the ball at the Texas 45 yard line this Brad started on Notre Dame to 20yard line they have kept the ball right on the ground minutes 13 seconds left in the third quarter drawn into a wild ride Chris close to McAfee balls spread it away in completed passes the ball in completion it's a judgment call and instead of reception and fumble the judgment is in completed pass and McAfee is not too happy with it either here's a little roll out by playaction good pickup by a Vegas Ferguson now McAfee right there gets really hit what the ruling was the referee right on top of the play ruled that he did not have possession and again that big hit coming from Johnny Johnson he's a free safety you need doesn't have really good size feel free safety although he's very tall but he was stickier what's that forearm shiver wrong heavens picked up two yards to the 43 as Morgan Copeland made the tackle it will be third down and eight yards to go Notre Dame in Texas territory Dolman coming out and with the next play see if they go to the big tight end Ken McAfee he's only caught two passes there in the first half for 18 yard right into the right side roaming far like presence to the left side running backs of an ayah formation aunt Anna or the screen laughter Ferguson Wow ball got away but Notre Dame retains 28 as they market Notre Dame at the 28 yard line of Texas Vegas Ferguson walking the tightrope still was a big first down play they needed about eight yards on the screen left to Vegas Ferguson he's going to get a break now he goes out in Terry Yorick comes under replacing Fergus Fergus what it did a good job there because if you'll notice Johnny gossamer actually read the play had a chance to make the tackle didn't execute with the 22 yard line except about seven to make it second out of three yards to go but killing them straight up the middle looks like they get four or five there anytime they want to call yeah you know you really hate to get down on somebody because obviously the man's doing the best job he can but in his defense he's not logged a lot of playing time this year but that's where they're going second now play coming promoted let's go men in motion across from a wing lock directors carry stock team up Texas is certainly realized obviously if they are getting killed in the middle so they've gone back now to the alignment that has the start of the ball game Mark Martin Oni is back at middle linebacker and Robinson lines back in the ball game on the weak side so more campuses has been taken out third and three mark SIA is in there now double tight in alignment for Notre Dame or Lindsey they've controlled the ball for almost five minutes on this Drive clear and free at the 22 yard line Montana a toast a magazine completed to go line a fourth and three at the 22 he was open ball just overthrown by Montana well he had a decision to make her he could have run the football picked up the first down but McAfee slipped behind the defensive back there in Montana just overthrew him a little bit defender on the play Lynn Blackwood and he's not much of a physical match for magazine 39 yard field goal attempt coming up now for weave during the season with a 51 yard here burgmaier will hold for him with rustic out with an intern that's the father used the tea of course it is shorted we put in plant the 20yard line first and ten at the 20 under College roof so the score is still Notre Dame 24 Texas ten nine minutes 58 seconds remaining in the third quarter of the Cotton Bowl game in Dallas Texas has the ball first and ten at their own 20yard line they had trailing by 14 points McEachern brings them up running back suspect camel in the left set for three yards for the 23 we have to be second down and seven let's take a look at 55 the middle linebacker Bob Golic only a junior and he'll probably be a number one round draft choice next year he's keying on number 20 is Ross browner got him low and rolling tha's right there Alfred Jackson goes far to the left side now second down and seven yards to go incomplete trying to get his tight end Gil Harris Gil Harris 82 of the man for her lacrosse intended third and second the horns normally do not like to go to their tight end so what that's telling you is that Notre Dame is doing an excellent job covering the wide receivers I think McEachern might have made a bad decision on that play he could have run the football I think it picked up the first down there he could have but he has been admonished by the texting Texas coaching staff not to run the ball unless absolutely necessary he's not a good runner he doesn't pretend to be and given the choice between stopping up and throwing and keeping the ball they'd rather have him throw the thing it is only accepted I'm Friday I am better the linebacker in his first feeling out over of the day Lindsay for notre dame gets the football Notre Dame is leading 24 to 10 9 minutes 9 seconds in the third quarter this is Lindsey Nelson with Paul Hornung Paul Alexander Don Ricky Jack Whittaker at the Cotton Bowl and we had alleged to have Paul Alexander with us this afternoon he is the host of coach Fred Akers weekly show in Austin Texas and from a support structure of our CBS affiliate in Austin Notre Dame has the ball first in ten they have it the biggest Fergus after the 25yard line for a gain of four where it's going to be second I'm in six yards to go oh he got popped by Johnny Johnson there he's gonna get up a little bit slow see if we could pick it up for once you call this hint weed I'm really impressed with Ferguson because looking takes a solid shot from Johnny Johnson and just bounces right off it tries to keep the speed he is a tough man to bring down because how farmers should Johnson a bombilla Chris hands to the left side Tom told me to the right side he's cut off at the pass that's it over on the tackle that's the first time we've seen the true option from Notre Dame in this that's right he won't run it too much Montana of course better throwing the football rolling out coming back they don't like to run that option do too much with him in there we're down and about eight yards to go 27 yard line their documents they are 6 of 10 the bad percentage and rolling miss Montana is going on the run complete the second there by Weimer who stayed in bounds at the 11 yard at the 16 yard line maybe the 15 wide open out of the I Montana will roll out to the left it's just a little sprout pattern over here in Montana executed that's perfect hardest pass for the poly scores to throw a rolling to his left going to his left eight way mark on the reception so nice first and ten for Notre Dame at the Texas 15yard line running back to the knife formation they're on a wing left and that is dome in the wing back across in motion it is Urich carrying Terry York and he is stopped for a loss of about a foot maybe as much as a yard all right nobody made the tackle it'll be second and 11 at the 16 yard line being out wait up front is nothing new for the Texas defense that's normally been the case week after week after week so you'll notice that to offset that physical mismatch Texas will do a lot of looping and stunning in games to try to create some confusion in the offensive line so I cannot eleven yards to go a Notre Dame 24 Texas ten seven and a half minutes remaining in the third quarter Notre Dame's running in a slot left waiver slide back in motion across on Thomas got the ball I need clothes to Urich inside the ten Urich outofbounds at the 5yard line it was just a great pitch at time Lindsey Montana to Terry Urich he's actually covered by Robinson line on the right side watch this now now sent line actually he's got pretty good coverage there it's just a good pitch and a good catch Urich that's going to be shaken up right here on this play a little bit you can't stop that perfect throw actually pretty good job by sin line so Yorick is still down struggling to get to the first down sticks and he is still down in the first half all for Notre Dame's scoring drive started after the turnovers inside 235 it's going to be a first and goal inside the 5yard line when players resume first and goal on the for Dan to buy on the head coach that's Merv Johnson right there to his right the assistant head coach at Notre Dame first and goal at the 4yard line Notre Dame is leading 24 to 10 7 minutes 17 seconds remaining to be played in the third quarter of the 1978 Cotton Bowl game in Dallas Texas Wainwright after the three yard line and that's all second and goal at the three yard line Jefferson and then on the tackle you know I don't think we should go any further Lindsay we should mention the offense of blocking for the re shopfront Dave Huffman the center a junior six five to forty seven he's doing a fine job the guards Ted Horan ski and Ernie Hughes and the tackle Steve McDaniels and Tim Foley have just been outstanding they've been getting a lot of holes especially from tackle tackle for the Notre Dame reading attack our city is in there now SIA is into the double khai dinh Orsini's ended a running back Stan and his bankers Frank isn't hitting in for the touchdown they against Ferguson hit it into the end zone for a touchdown and there must be a little weakness over there because that's the third time this afternoon gone off the left side for three touchdowns this time it's Vegas Ferguson in the first half Terry Urich got two at the same spot while they caught him in the game Texas is in the Blitz that time and did ran to the weak spot now Notre Dame 30 Texas ten will the conversion of Jeff coming from the Fighting Irish burgmaier will hold for Dave Reed butch it up and it's good so as they come back up the field and the 1978 cotton ball game after moving 29 yards in seven plays its Notre Dame 31 flexes kickoff day abri will do the booting Johnny Johnson has dropped back to in place of lamb Jones who hobbled off the field so it's Johnson and Jackson back Dave to receive it for the University of Texas Longhorns Johnny Johnson keep in mind that the big one Super Bowl 12 is coming up on CBS Sunday January 15 oh I can't wait Denver against Dallas that great defense of the Denver Broncos well there Dallas Cowboys with no slouch have said Lala's 804 Tom Jackson and of course this Roger Staubach Tony Dorsett Harvey mark for what a great matchup and the Super Bowl today will be 4:30 to 6:00 an hour and a half pregame show all on CBS to the 33 where to be second down in seven yards to go Lindsay that sprint outdraw played out of the I formation it's been one of the staples of the Texas attack all year long and it's really been very very ineffective today Notre Dame doing a great job on it seven plays 29 yards got the ball 2 minutes 20 seconds did Notre Dame 6 minutes 24 seconds left to play in the third quarter the Longhorns trying to move the football and I keep in mind they scored on a one play situation on the last play I'm Jones I'm Hamlin Texas loaded after the 35 yard line for twoway 3/3 and fires I'm right here made the typo from his left outside linebacker post for Notre Dame Texas offense now operating without the services of wide receiver Johnny lamb Jones the Olympic sprinter he's a out with that pulled hamstring he suffered in the first half in his place Ronnie mish and Michael Lockett are alternating at that position keep in mind that this Texas team on the road defeated Oklahoma and Arkansas on successive weekend third down and five yards to go I am cried or batted it down number 58 please the gentleman just just got the interception he comes up with the big third down play for the Irish so the punting unit comes on now and they're starting to put the number one up already way they're playing right now you can't blame them on formation actually even descended to the punty smitson burgmaier dropped back to field upon for Notre Dame a check threeputt Barakat signal goes up and it's made at the 20yard line so burgmaier go then and they will start priest in ten Justin at basketball up to 21 yard line in front of 45 yards in no return I'll tell you that Erick Slavens a while character who said earlier he missed the last couple of games of the regular season with a pulled quadriceps muscle but he said that if healthy he promised a 70 yard field goal in this game we got the opportunity I liked the idea and he came back to the injury dropped by kick 153 yards and pronounced himself semi healthy twisting in with the 21 motion across from Wimmer 33 yard line and Johnny dancer 13 yard pickup for Vegas Ferguson and the guys up front are really doing the job a good endzone shot of this i watch the blocking right at the point of attack boy that's a nice sized Bowl I'll tell you furgus it cuts to his right picks up 13 for a Notre Dame first down right ready maximum a formation for your laptop Dolman in motion across the Jerome happens he gets two yards to the 35 where they'll be second down at 8 yards to go well I tell you when the Notre Dame coaches go over this film after the ballgame they've got to be impressed with the job that kuransky is doing offensively it had right guard for Notre Dame because he's got a standoff or better with Texas his Outland Trophy winner Brad sure and if I'm speaking to the official what's he so hot about across the 40yard line heavens caring and again I'm going to point out the offense of interior lineman counting the tight end Ken McAfee six of them average 257 pounds now the for defensive down linemen for Texas and near three linebackers averaged 216 I think that has been a big story this football game third and very short here now magus Ferguson curves penalty markers in advance of the sticks but there's a penalty market to beat Chuck Todd Copeland on churchmen made the stop protective procedure against Notre Dame will cost them five yards you know min ago I gave credit to ten four on ski for doing that great job job on Brad Shearer well admittedly her on ski has done a great job today but he's been blocking on Steve McMichael it's Ernie Hughes it's been put it on Brad Shearer I say putting it on him as good a job as you can do with a guy like that I very penalty is marked up they'll see a little procedure Hughes would be a high draft choice you're going the first two rounds also are three transponder probably gonna make a couple of the horses I would think so cheer will be a number one third and seven here now back to 37 yard line glad to draw play didn't go as Texas read it up and see if McMichael was done to make the tackle along with Jefferson punting unit comes out now for Notre Dame Johnny Johnson is driving back to receive the punt for Texas haven't seen a lot of Steve McMichael the guy that made that tackle today but he's known as the most enthusiastic player on the Texas team they say he even likes wind sprints again it's going to be Kevin you know doing the punting impressive rustic rustic went out with an injury in the first half and Kevin you know is during the punting for Notre Dame sent off for fair catch and he makes it at the 32 yard line where Texas will start will televise the final rounds of the Grand Prix masters from Madison Square Garden in New York on CBS next Saturday at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time next Sunday at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time that's Guillermo Vilas Jimmy Connors and Bjorn Borg bought a three the best in the world and the prize for that one Lindsey I wouldn't mind having 100 fingers get your attention doesn't it it's the Grand Prix masters tennis championship on CBS first and 10 at the 32 yard line mr. quarterback got to the 34yard line where it'll be second and eight Ross browner in the make the tackle along with Bob gullet Texas now with three wide receivers in the ball game they said earlier today before the ballgame if they plan to go with it in the first half which we did not see that particular formation but I guess now that's down by 21 points with only a little more than a quarter remaining it's time to start putting it up and three wide receivers the way to do it in 37 seconds room maybe to be played in the third quarter thirtyfive before he's popped back it'll be third and seven Bob Dole Achmed the tackle you know it's amazing here's a guy of course he's gonna be one of the great posers still on the ground there he got pop real hard Earl Campbell the Heisman Trophy winner the country's leading rusher this year the country's leading scorer let's look again see if we can pick up the hit here on the left side here's Campbell coming off the left side a goalie gets him first and I think he just pulled a muscle I don't think the tackle is that vicious Campbell's got 97 yards and 23 carries to see another angle from the end zone out of the eye that's her old Campbell you see goalie setting the eye he gets hit from the inside by Jeff Weston the defensive tackle and go leaks behind it well let's hope that big guy's all right because he's all class you know you read so much about her all about his religious beliefs about his love for his family about for what a tough back background he came from and I'll tell you it's all true it's not hi he's really a class individual looks like he's got some type of leg problem and probably finished with the day Earl Campbell one of the great college football players coming off the field here at the Cotton Bowl Delbert Thompson is coming to the ballgame to replace him he is a freshman from Hamlin Texas number 45 third and seven at the 35 yard line and it's completed did he ever threaten evil with that one taken by Alfred Jackson if the first intend now Texas in Notre Dame territory at the 47 yes sir that something texas has used very effectively all year long Alfred Jackson on the post root McEachran's been having his problems today but this time he puts it there right between two defenders some kind of tough courageous catch by Alfred Jackson and by the way average twenty five point five yards per catch this year Andy Harrison on the tackle for Notre Dame first and ten Texas Jackson is in the slot left almost to the 45 yard line for two where it will be second down and eight yards to go Delbert Thompson carry that's Delbert Thompson filling in now for Earl Campbell Delbert is a freshman from Hammond Texas he from the same hometown as Johnny ham Jones and the Longhorns have high hopes for him in the years to come in fact he's the heir apparent to Campbell we have one minute 20 seconds remaining to be played in the third quarter it's Notre Dame 31 Texas ten this is coming to a while it's on the ride low Jackson on the slot left kitchen going to Jackson back in the endzone Randy Harrison has it for a touchback first and 10 Notre Dame at their 20yard line Harrison with the interception to get into the end zone at the 20 well Texas has no chance here they're trying to go for the home run that's exactly what all the defensive secondary for Notre Dame is looking for they're looking for the bomb you could see him is double covered back here and it would be up in the air Jackson tips it and Randy Harrison plays a little juggling Matt gets it in the end zone it'll be brought out to the 20 the teacher now three interceptions and Texas has also lost three fumbles six turnovers 26 now let's go down to Don Ricky hi Lindsay yeah this is earl campbell of course the great Heisman Trophy winner he has his left foot they're examining it now whether or not it's a fracture or severe sprain they don't know if it does appear to be an injury that he cannot put weight on the foot and whether or not he'll be back is a very moot point right now our oak Campbell is hurt let's go back upstairs all right Don crickey at second down and four yards to go a Texas for the ball another Notre Dame with the ball at their own 26 little dot for the 29 yard line once again there is Johnny Johnson there on the tackle along with Jefferson well you hate to see a great back like that Indy's collegiate career in the third and one Vegas Ferguson carried the clock is winding down out of the end of the third quarter five seconds four seconds three seconds two seconds one second and time has run out in the period so that's the end of the third quarter with the score Notre Dame 31 Texas ten female cause for word from your local station as we start the fourth quarter it is third down in the yard to go for Notre Dame this is Lindsey Nelson following ball landed on Ricky Jack Whitaker in Dallas Texas rotor Davis leading 31 to 10 let's try to wedge him out and pick it up and they did its first and ten let's go down to Don tricky but there's more optimism now over Earl Campbell's condition it appears to be a sprain no fracture they've typed the ankle very tightly they're going to try to put him back in the football game who's mobilities in question but he will go back in oh my god Ricky always at the 31 yard line first and ten for Notre Dame and that is good news Connor is they really need a guy like that he needs to break one to get some momentum back from that Texas offense and nobody wants in worse than Earl does heavens on heavens bow down at the line of scrimmage by Bradshaw of the Outland Trophy winner and allamerican tackle at the University of Texas it's gonna be second down and ten yards to go at the 31 yard line a beautiful day over the Cotton Bowl last night it did not appear that we'd have this kind of weather because there are a few flakes of snow falling on in Dallas last night cause a little bit cool about 20 miss Ferguson glad to stretch his bunny out for a yard and you got about a foot or so it's Henry Williams call it third down and nine yards to go just short of the 32 the low point of the Notre Dame season came of course in their second game when they lost to Ole Miss in Jackson Mississippi Notre Dame and most of the preseason prognostications had been touted as possible national championship winners but then are they lost the early game they had to sort of regroup change the offense came back in the big upset there's over Southern Cal and they rolled off from there again it's the Texas defense and velay Kerr they lacquer in there at the 32 Lindsay if they can hold on there's 21point lead I think it's going to be a little bit more than a possibility it's going to be a strong possibility the Notre Dame players have really felt coming to this ballgame they had an excellent opportunity to beat Texas they were very confident and they felt if they win this football game they should be number one every meal no advice to do the funny blackboard is calling for the ferret coach and he makes it at the 41 yard line when we first in ten Texas the Longhorns will start at their own 45 minutes 53 seconds remaining to be played in the game a 27 yard pot farm you know first antonova texas the long where I tell the ball at the 41 yard line he turns still quarterbacking first the offenses we're old Campbell carried the football across to the 47 yard line Earl Campbell back in the ballgame and he carried it well I like the guts and determination this guy he was carried off looked like he would not reenter the ballgame here he comes right back they reap taped his ankle he is now over 100 yards rushing he's got 103 420 second time in his career he's got over under that six just there and second down and four yards to go bacon by Johnny ham Jones and Ken Dyck made the tackle tough just short of the 49 again if you're speaking to the national championship of course the Texas Longhorns and their followers have felt that even if they lose they have as good a claim with the national championship as anybody else because they would be only once defeated they point out they've had to defend the national championship the number one ranking at least throughout the entire season something nobody else had to do arguments arguments third out in two yards to go bitch and Troy and it's beyond the reach of Alfred Jackson let's go down to Don Ricky Lindsey there is a very marked contrast and the attitude of this Texas team now here in the fourth quarter is the seconds tick away and the possible national championship with it this was a very enthusiastic team even trailing 24 to 10 at the outset of the third quarter it's not anymore the Texas players mumbling about the seven turnovers this has never happened to them before this season and right now it's a very really a depressed or around this team as Notre Dame continues to dominate with the fourth quarter wearing on was he all right Don Ricky a penalty marker and the preliminary signal is ineligible fast receiver downfield for Texas so that is being attended to right now Lindsey it's only normal and natural to take this team should be somewhat responded over what's happening to him right now but it said so many times before this is really a class but they had ineligible man downfield and cover it in on Texas decline carry on follows ended okay as I said they are a marvelously close group of individuals and they are not about to quit they will keep firing and scratching them doing the kind of things that have brought them through that 11 low records they had going into the ball game Texas has taken a timeout now in a 4th and 3 situation with Notre Dame having declined that penalty Texas call the timeout Japan and exactly what they want to do failing in the ball game by score thirty one to ten with eleven minutes 49 seconds on the clock I have to go for it question about that three touchdowns behind and this like Paul said if we're going to scratch they're gonna have to scratch awful digs to get into a 21point lead they continue to try to run inside against this Notre Dame defense well we got a little time I think I'd like to just say hello to maybe Notre Dame's number one fan back in Chicago the hospital Judy coming who has never missed a game in 32 years following the Notre Dame and hold and on the road we wish her a speedy recovery and a happy new year X Laban is back there but at the gamble here but they stopped it short three touchdowns down Lindsey I'd have to go for Doug Becker was right there faked the handoff they gave it the number 27 Johnny dared the ball when the ball goes over on fourth down they snapped it short but it was read up a little fancy right here Alec conformation take a tall okay the snap goes to Ricky churchmen it's on the reverse and then the ball goes back to Johnny Johnson he takes it around the left side Oh as I said before they're coming at him with all guns blazing but Notre Dame's up to it naturally it could have fooled the camera moon but it didn't fool number 43 Doug Becker first and 10 just across the 50 yard line and sister ohm heavens and he is popped right Jefferson came in to make the tackle and it is back there at the 49 yard line you know there's been some bad blood between these two thieves I think a lot of it goes back to the Heisman trophy presentation I know that Kim MacAfee you when he accepted the outstanding receiver award didn't think that what he was saying was so inflammatory but some of the Texas players took offense to it we'll get back to at the moment second down and 12 yards to go has the ball and the catch is made inbounds at the 34 yard line Weimer the wing back Weimer pulled it in here's Montana it's a little squirrel pattern on the right side about 12 yards deep Dave Weimer a sophomore out of Charlotte good move right there the technical corner made have really been given another name the she was a lot too much room 51 34 yard line of Texas first and 10 Notre Dame at the Texas 34 10 minutes 58 seconds left to play vii rome heavensent at the 29yard on here is a final score in the Sugar Bowl game Alabama 35 ohio state 6 alabama 35 ohio straight six so that's another deity laying claim to the national championship already championship it'll all be decided in the postseason poll Vegas Ferguson end of the 26 yard line short of the six led share along with Dwight Jefferson made the tackle Notre Dame now a very content to keep it on the ground I think they picked up three or four yards every carry thirty seconds go off that clock 25 seconds Kevin's is now over a hundred yards 22 carries for Jerome heavens 101 yards he's only a junior and I know Dan Devine gonna be very happy to have him back third him to a 56 yard line double Qaeda and Mark SIA is in there the Ketchum he's gone touchdown Vegas Ferguson touchdown he caught a nineyard pass in the first half from touchdown from Montana watch this cutback their journey in fact he got to confront of the guard and he makes a great big news Ferguson only a sophomore from Richmond Indiana let's put her name on top 37 to 10 with a conversion attempt coming as Vegas Ferguson goes to the sidelines he missed a good part of the season with an injury gave the offense a great boost when he came back to fulltime action late in the season he's carried 21 times but 94 yard here this afternoon Avery will attempt the conversion with burgmaier holding point and it's good so as they come back up the field here at the 1978 cotton ball game in Dallas Texas it is Notre Dame 38 and Texas 10 I play is 50 yards kept the ball 2 minutes from one second and now it's going to be Davey kicking off Johnny ham Jones has dropped back this time Johnny ham Jones is back there without frataxin honey lamb Jones went out with an injury now for Jackson is waiting at the 7yard on he's got it at the 10 to the 15 for the 20 to the 25 and out to the 27 yard line they'll start first and 10 it was hankered downfield to make the tackle for Notre Dame CBS Sports spectacular 1978 will present an exciting calendar of events in January and will feature the WBC world light heavyweight championship between defending champion Miguel Cuellar and ma tape our life and that is next Saturday and then later it's the world

boa Texas Longhorn a violation on the kickoff and so we will bring it back and do it all over again offsides against plexis violation of the kickoff proceeding formation until they kick it from the 45 some years ago fall running I was doing the USC UCLA game and red Sanders was coaching UCLA he said to me I have never had a kickoff run back for a touchdown against a team of mine in prep school college anywhere the next day they kicked to John Arnett he would have run out into the street if it had been at the peristyle in but there was a violation of the kickoff receiving formation nullified our Nets returned they kicked it off again and still nobody had returned one against them Avery putting it up Johnny ham Jones is on his way to the 1520 I crossed the 23 yard line Rexy starts first in ten tell you what man you've really got to be impressed with the job as a Notre Dame coaching staff has done getting this team ready don't you they're so beautifully prepared they really are and they were sky high of course and it's a little bit easier you know a little a lot of pressure was on Texas ranked number one they knew all they had to do was win by one point they would have had the national championship locked up interesting thing happened Notre Dame felt that they were so ready that they canceled yesterday's practice I thought they were ready where's the pitch to Campbell ramaa runs him out of bounds at the 26 yard line we had a three yards on the play will make it second and seven I wish I could have canceled yesterday sometimes these upsets they do come along Paulie you know one guy I really feel particularly sorry for right now is Randy McEachern you know what a storybook performance he's turned in this year he was the third team quarterback was redshirt he to sophomore year misses entire junior with an injury and they would not be in this ballgame were it not for him he's too bad he's hugging such a tough day pitching right there and the option pitch I mean I'm John just pulled out my Scott setting well that option stuffs not going to go right and hail Notre Dame for just ladles ears back and come well the key to it has been the linebackers have stopped everything on the inside and the defensive ends fries etic browner they just have been keying the wide stuff third and 12 now at the 21 yard line Lexus in possession Notre Dame is leading 38 to 10 we have eight minutes 54 seconds left to play in the game rocket Jackson the right side that's Campbell again 23 back here beside himself Becker and Bob Golic on the tackle Earl Campbell the class man he got up patted I think it was 75 Jay case in new he knows he's in for a long afternoon they have really keyed on that young man so it is a fourth down and Kirk Slavin comes in to punt the ball Schmitz and burgmaier drop back to field it for Notre Dame burgmaier cost for the fair catch and makes it at the 45 his own 45 first and 10 Notre Dame so the Fighting Irish start now leading by score at 38 to 10 and we have exactly eight minutes remaining to be played in the Cotton Bowl game the enemy of Texas now is old man time we have eight minutes remaining to be played in this game Notre Dame is leading by four thirty eight to ten rusty Malaysia started warming up his arm behind the Notre Dame been she is the backup quarterback to number two quarterback Montana at quarterback the entire game at is Vegas Ferguson another stone that is the freshman from Seattle ranchera made the tackle gemstone he picked up two yards for the 47 to make it second down and eight yards to go you know as talented as Notre Dame is going into the ball game the Texas coaching staff did not think that the Irish played with a lot of discipline but they sure display some discipline today they are filling those lanes and having those assignments David Mitchell's in the ball game for Notre Dame Mackey was pull back for much of the season Weimer motion across Lake Gaston Montana's got the ball mcafee cat hold it is an incompletion it'll be third down on eight yards to go let's take a look at Kidd McAfee very very seldom drops a pass like this Montana out of the I little fake running around to the left side and you'll see McAfee come into the picture right there he should have had it he did for a minute took his eye off of an incomplete well it tied in dragging across the middle has got to be one of the toughest routes in the world to cover it is third down and eight yards to go for Notre Dame that is rusty leash warming up he was a starting quarterback for Notre Dame at the start of the season Mitchell is the back stone at the tailback dome it's in motion across four miles down it's going long Chris hands and it's incomplete a penalty Marcus throne there was a marker thrown there is an interference call there's gonna be some dispute on this one mister interpretation right here possibly offensive interference all fancy pass 10 affairs down and this is number 82 Christine's is running the flat pattern out of playaction pass Montana pulls up here throws the home run ball coverage by Blackwood good job by him Glenn Blackwood let's see if we could pick up the hands right they could happen to about 5 yards back Chris Haynes did put his hands on Glenn Blackwood offensive pass interference down when Lassa down at his fourth arm punting it is coming on off a Notre Dame Devin you know during the punting with Joe a stick out with an injury 7 minutes 8 seconds remaining to be played Johnny Johnson dropping back to feel the punch all right we haven't seen this guy do his thing yet today let's see when getting fired up speaking of Johnny Johnson they return man for Texas Johnson after 27 he's well covered by the notredame special teams unit and it stopped at the 29 yard line so it'll be first down in 10 yards to go for the Longhorns no the ball at their own 29 we have six minutes 59 seconds left to play in the Cotton Bowl game first and ten Texas Longhorns at their own 29 McEachern is seven for 1821 watch three interceptions Jackson has it at the 35yard line and back to the 30 and now pull out of bounds at the 30 yard line run into Brody I did a gain of a yard on the completion who says this cat's not tough watch this drag patted by Alfred Jackson all the way across the middle McEachern just waits for him to break open really an excellent fastest time and he does take a shot look at this ricochet that's Becker that's Doug Becker he knocks him back and go Lakes right there coming in for the cleanup along with vector Alfred might have been better off taking a doubt look at that nose he's number one right Campbell at the 28 yard line and it's Jay case on the tackle it'll be third down at 11 yards to go we have six minutes 34 seconds remaining to be played in the game Notre Dame 38 in Texas 10 well that's a big part of the story of this ballgame Lindsey nobody has stopped Earl Campbell yet as the Notre Dame fans start chanting goodbye Texas we hate to see you go penalty markers drawn McEachern with a completed bash up for 37 yard line it was taken there by Gil Harris two tight end markers being checked out we have quite upside now they might get a third and six and move it after the 33 yard line that's it along there you know something that for the most part we've neglected to mention today is the incredible job that Fred Akers has done done and this just his first year at Texas as you know he spent nine years and as an assistant coach at Texas between 66 and 74 lopsided the wild name Fred Akers it's been a Cinderella story when he went out to Wyoming to get two years experience as a head coach they asked him if he would be leaving soon and would be used as a stepping stone he said they were only two jobs he'd take if offered Arkansas very close to the sticks he'll take a long look at this one it was Bobby Leopold on the tackle I tell you these linebackers are really putting the leather so if we could pick up the pop here just around to the tight end Gil Harris and watch the hit here coming up Leroy Leopold I sophomore from Port Arthur Texas really puts a good tackle on Harris I've seen tamer train wrecks Leopold had a good season for Notre Dame Rebekah was out with an injury he came in there as a line back he had three interceptions in the course of the season to four touchdowns first and ten that's Kegel warming up now long sideline a freshman who is a heralded allamerican quarterback in Cincinnati during his high school days Paul Brown was quoted as saying he didn't need to go to college he'd go right from high school to the pros undefeated never lost a game in high school McEachern and his two mesh complete at the 43 yard line another first and ten for the Texas Longhorns Mike Whittington made the tackle little Ronnie mich he could senior log very very little playing time although he does have two touchdown catches this year also missed a couple games with a broken hand he's been a squad but never lettered but oh what a root runner he is he's got exceptional moves and he's not afraid of anything at his first down in ten years going up with a long haul future that time it will be second intended 243 Ross browner and his brothers were heavily cruded by Ohio State because of course they live in Warren Ohio and Ross Brown has said he wanted to come to Notre Dame because it was an independent he weren't in a conference and also they had no athletic dormitory but what Hall did you live in I lived in a lot of halls actually never stayed in the same one two consecutive years at their request second Johnny have Josh okay 39 yard line Golic and I can to make the tackle for Notre Dame hey third down and six Johnny ham Jones always loses the goose you think he's not intense he consistently grades out higher than any other Texas office player very very rarely close an assignment allows Christian sits in there now at the strong safety for Notre Dame in place of Jim browner kitchen chased by Rosco gendai Kinross browner last year four minutes look at ham Jones's Jersey just ripped off browner on the sack that time and the last four or five minutes dandelion is starting to give his second unit third unit some playing time we start to substitute quite freely now as McEachern with the tour in Jersey and it's a time out Texas kitchens over to get some new habit a Sheree clock shows four minutes 50 seconds left to play in the game and Notre Dame is leading by a score of 38 to 10 McEachern has rushed seven times today for 38 yards for Texas one thing I could promise you when this is all over tomorrow the newspapers and here in the electronic media these Texas players will give the credit where it deserves and that's to the Notre Dame ballclub they came in here with the job to do and they did it keep in mind now coming up on January 15th it's the big one of the NFL the Super Bowl and it's going to be the Denver Broncos from the Dallas Cowboys at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time from the Superdome in New Orleans right here on CBS this promise to be some kind of magic day football today from 4:30 the Super Bowl today preceding the Super Bowl game January 15th on CBS fourth down and fourteen yards to go McEachern on fourth down throws it and it's complete Lee says it this is a first down it's at the 32 yard line Michigan looks more like a choir boys and a receiver but he's an extremely hard worker always the first guy out to practice and the last one in out route this time again a pretty well thrown ball by McEachern malicious about to run past anybody I wouldn't run at Luther Bradley Irish down and 10 yards to go Lockett going to slide right and TJ didn't have a chance heatran dropped it's gonna be about the 42 yard line Scott said he got done so did Ken Dyke man that ain't no fair fight that's a long day for McEachern he's had his problems and a lot of people were guessing they said if Texas had to throw the ball over 20 times ago they'd be in trouble timeout Texas the Longhorns have taken another timeout and McEachern again is coming to the sidelines well we've talked about it before but everybody will be talking about it after the games are over today who is number one who is the national champion had Texas won the ballgame there's no question they're the only major undefeated untied team in the country they would have been cleared national champions in all the polls but now where they Notre Dame victory seemingly shirred 426 remaining and Notre Dame leading 38 to 10 there will be a host of once defeated team Notre Dame will have lost once they will claim the national championship Alabama they have a good case for having defeated Texas Texas will claim the national championship saying we lost only one game Alabama will claim the only one game and whoever wins the Orange Bowl game between Arkansas and Oklahoma will claim the national championship it'll be decided but the polls the AP the UPI are the football writers Football Foundation Hall of Fame and if you want to your own personal national championship can be awarded because none of them are official how about me my own personal guess what who beat Texas that's all I'm gonna think about second honor 19 yards to go bring them up the kitchen and completing almost intercepted boys Randi Harrison making a move on it it is some kind of tough that's real that kind of pattern this late in the game defensive backs know exactly what's going on they take that real deep drop and that's not a very enviable position at all Paul let me ask you a question how long has it been since you've seen a game where Earl Campbell has not broken at least one run over 20 yards this is obviously the first time this year and I guess it would date back to back last year when he was having the injury problems suffice to say Notre Dame's done a better job on him than anybody else easily lost prouder made the tackle for Notre Dame laughs riders had a great career at Notre Dame and he will go high when the draft choices are announced nobody wants to win worse than Earl does but he'll be his old sweet self after the ballgame your momma called eleven children story Pam was longest run today's been 18 yards 44 seconds left to play 18 here the first plate of Campbell Campbell's got it looking for the sticks but he is going out of bounds at the 32 yard line Steve Heim Crider made the tackle so the ball goes over the Notre Dame on downs but 10 yard short of the first down and even the stuff you drop in the dirt in working today defense is just to shake hands with the Earl Campbell is he passed him you saw it there McAfee and as Paul Alexander pointed out McAfee after the speech at the Heisman Trophy dinner was not exactly a hero in Texas some of his remarks I think we're a little misinterpreted I don't think he meant it no I don't either but you saw the handshake there between McAfee and Campbell Lindsey if you're coaching Notre Dame you wouldn't mind it at all they were number five they need a little support if they did beat Texas muster lace the quarterback on the handoff rush delish in the ball game handing it off to David Mitchell and the tackle Jefferson and Brad Shera see the clock running 315 remaining to be played it's gonna be second down and eight yards to go where's the ball is out at the 35 yard line let's dalish quarterbacking Montana quarterback Notre Dame for most of the day at an early injury but stayed in the ball game Mitchell is the fullback stolen if the tailback smitson motion across had stolen the freshman from Seattle got about a yard at the 36 yard line which would make it third down at 7 yards to go Morgan Copeland came on coming over to make the tackle for Texas be very exciting back for Notre Dame there's only a freshman 6:1 182 pounds can really fly in fact he had the longest run from scrimmage for Notre Dame this year of 58 yards he averaged six point seven yards of carry every time he touched it way where to the right side Texas is out of timeouts that's delish Estill H to the 40 the 45 got the first shot at midfield you think Notre Dame's going back to that monster night tell you I think they might stay right here in Big D 2 minutes 38 seconds left Notre Dame 38 in Texas 10 you know a lot of people were concerned that Notre Dame it had been here in Dallas so long that maybe they lost their edge but so much for that argument they had been here almost as long as Paul Hornets right fourth week here what if they as much fun as Horning I'm sure they did rolling his leash going to McAfee McAfee has got into 35 yard line another first and 10 week Treach right in to make the tackle black if he coming across from the left side faked his stone it roll out to the right all the blocking in the world he could have picked out any receiver there everybody was wide open and here comes Ricky churchmen here who just hangs on and they got a little hugging match going on right here head churchmen had a tough job he's had oneonone coverage with McAfee all day long hold it hold it somebody says clock's not working it stopped at 2:10 the clocks not working somebody says that means a big jump on a watch on the field Campbell did break one Cotton Bowl record Lindsay most carries 29 carries today for 116 yards and a number of those coming on the bad leg Jerell getting straightened out here about the clock not working with two minutes ten seconds time will be kept usually what was that they were booing coach Devine the clock is not operating we're putting it on 205 and it'll be kept on the field by putting it on 205 and then the time will be kept on the field clock shows 210 rock shows 210 pay no attention to the clock it is presently an operative and so they go to the stopwatch on the field Lisa don't booth Santa Claus here I had referee tells rusty licious first down he wants to shut the clock off so it doesn't show anything to kill the clock a lot of fans just come on this football field when this game ends my stylish incomplete heading it'll be second in 10 after 35 Steve McMichael the defensive tackle for Texas just leveled lish public address announcer is informing the crowd now that the official time is being kept on the field dolmen is coming and the clock of course in any case stopped on the incompletion there is no twominute warning in college of adult listen to the right let's delay sir a onehand catch and another first down Notre Dame at the 23 oh great example of the great hands of Ken McAfee here's less rolling out to the right now watch this one hand and left with these left hand what a catch ken McAfee his father played at Alabama and then played tight end with the Giants back if he had 205 scholarship office when he finished high school flamer it's incomplete Blackwood covering defensively like if he's had four catches for 46 yards today second than ten you know I wonder how the Texas defense is gonna react to all these passes late in the game Notre Dame pouring it on sure is they're trying to get another touchdown and of course they've got this game to plenty in hand but they're thinking about that number one ranking who can blame them thirty eight to ten forty five points against Texas would look a lot better than thirty eight I guess still eesh and it's incomplete intended for don not not the intended receiver number 21 it'll be third and ten at the 23 yard line you know Paul looking back on the ball game obviously the turnovers played a big part but don't you think that a lot of it has been the fact that there really has been a physical mismatch up front Notre Dame has control the line of scrimmage both ways well they coming into this fall again we talked about Notre Dame being bigger a little bit stronger up front and Texas had to counter with its quickness and it just wasn't a match today inside the 15yard line market about the 14 and Blackwood on the stop short a first down yardage rusty lish number two quarterback from Notre Dame rolls out to his left he sets up he's got Dave Weimer out to the left side here comes blend Blackwood up just mantoman coverage out there it'll be fourth down and a yard to go that is merv Josh from the assistant head coach George Kelly in the D fish Juliano Jimmy Johnson near the yard Weston lease got it its first 210 Molly's at the 12 yard line I don't know how much time remains because it's being careful to stop watch on the field you don't hear very much about Notre Dame's wide receivers the Dave Wiemers had an excellent day sure has he's only a sophomore fact the whole offensive backfield and the receivers except Kim MacAfee will return make sure they says the ball and he guns it complete inside the 5yard line palace then there and that is Palace with the football number 45 it's going to be put into the in violence marker and spotted now less than a minute remaining the crowd has started to move down to the sidelines and we'll have a race we've been coming on to this field timeout Notre Dame to stopped rather the game is over the game is over the game is over we'll return to the Cotton Bowl after this word from your local station well the cotton ball game is history time ran off Notre Dame had the ball inside the 5yard line at about two three when time had run out but Notre Dame wanted by a score of 38 to 10 and above said Factory as you look at the tunnel leading up to fourth dressing rooms Texas and Notre Dame mingling as they head for the locker robes up the tunnel Notre Dame has defeated Texas the only defeat of the year for the Texas Longhorns Notre Dame of course will lay claim to the national championship so why is that the thing that kill Texas were the turnovers and won the football game Lindsey the first four turnovers in the first half Notre Dame got four turnovers they put three touchdowns on the board and a field goal and that really started the ball rolling for the Irish and they've never looked back to me just convincingly 28point victory here today and I'm showing look at them they're happy going into that locker room and dandelion couldn't be happier either because I'm sure that he feels the Notre Dame should be number one there's Montana fine quarterback did an outstanding job I tell you them you know Paul Alexander brought up I think the point that really made the difference up front Notre Dame we're just too strong both offensively Dave Huff from the Senate Ted over asking early news the two bars Tim Foley and Steve McDaniels and Ken McAfee were just a little bit too strong upfront blocking and then of course the front floor and the linebackers for Notre Dame were just too fantastic I don't even remember Luther Bradley rustic or brown or a burglar I'm making a tackle they didn't have to you know Paul I think the coup de Gras in the ball game came right after halftime made sure we call Texas had close to within 14 points right before the half and Notre Dame just took that second half kickoff and really established control of the line of scrimmage and they did it on the ground which is something was surprised because Texas really did not feel that notre dame would be able to run the ball on them that effectively he only picked up two first downs in the second half unofficially Texas let's go to Don key and coach Dan / Lindsey here is the coach of Notre Dame a man who's been under much fire this year particularly after the team lost to Mississippi now directors T know it might be one of the great victories in the history of this university knows no question about that Dan it must be a great feeling well we have a great group there's old Joe rustics mom right down there she's a coach's wife she knows how I feel it's been a great privilege for me to work with this fine group of young people they're the ones that did the plane down and they've stayed a shape all year they've got themselves ready they've done what the coaches have asked them to do for them the University what about stopping Texas highly potent offense coach Devine really the great back Earl Campbell wasn't a factor in the game defenses a 98 percent emotion and two percent the other ingredients if his lungs are sound and we play a sound defense a team defense and the emotion how about you personally now you've been under a great deal of pressure it's a very difficult job they call Notre Dame a national university and certainly if you don't win every game any coach has ever been there has been under a lot of pressure you probably experience as much as any coach that's been there what is your attitude now towards the job at Notre Dame you haven't committed yourself as to whether you'd come back you said you'd wait till after this game how do you feel about continuing at Notre Dame I've just committed myself I feel great I've never been in better health and I'm great group of kids coming back we lose some good sophomores and I mean we do some good seniors but we have some good freshmen and sophomores and juniors coming back and we're going to be out there in the opening ballgame we're in green shirts I'll be there right along with them great all right Dan Devine the game overall today was one of really marked contrast to what the the forecasters the Wizards that they might not be predicted they thought the Texas would control the football with its good running game that their quickness on defense would shut down a Notre Dame offense but really your team dominated every single aspect do you think you can lay claim now to the national championship I honestly sincerely believe that we deserve it we earned it on the field and we should have it I'd like to I'd like to get into my squad on and I think you can understand that you know former athlete you know I'm anxious to get in here well Dan we're going to come in there and join you in the dressing right now you want to get in there with him congratulations again well thank you very much and congratulations to all the players and all Notre Dame people all over the world who I know today is a very happy one for them coach Dan dove I will be getting back to the coach and some of his players a little bit as they go into the locker room now let's go back up now to Lindsey Nelson all right Don those are Notre Dame fans on the field a Notre Dame ban has been out there they just spelled out an ende and went to the far sideline Notre Dame won at 38 210 you",

  "transcript": "regularly scheduled programming will not be seen at this time so that we may bring you the following ABC Sports exclusive this year's Sugar Bowl has got to be probably the P nothing probably got to be the biggest football game Penn State's ever played in it we not had a chance to win a national championship on the field of play this is our first time how important it is I don't know but we really like to get one and maybe the next one won't be quite as tough for me personally I don't think it means as much as it does to the seniors on this part this is gonna be their last chance to get it done hopefully I'm gonna be around long enough that maybe we can win one down the line but we should like to get this one said I assured the ball would mean a great deal to me I should be that selfish there's an order that mean to be because it's just another big football game as far as I'm concerned but where it would really mean something there's other players because when we recruited Bush those plans of all we asked him come here with the goal of winning a championship and we've been close but haven't won yet and they had they fought off the hard to come back this year here the position they are and to see you glad when it would make me very happy and I'd be proud of rest my life the 1979 Sugar Bowl matching the two teams battling on the field of the game that could mean the national championship number one ranked Penn State Nittany Lions number two ranked Crimson Tide of Alabama and it'll take place right here in one of the pieces of construction that's been called the marvel of the decade the Superdome inside warm and dry outside cold and wet Penn State and Alabama in the Superdome in New Orleans and this ABC Sports exclusive is brought to you by the folks at chevrolet who invites you to come on in to your chevy dealers coasttocoast for a look at an allstar lineup of cars and by dean witter reynolds one investment firm you'll be glad to hear from the Superdome is packed and why would that be look at this Penn State 11 wins and no losses first in all the major polls the only division 1a team to go undefeated tell em Emma lost one time to the USC in Birmingham since that time they rolled of all this is a dream matchup only the fifth time that one and two and the polls have met on the field the past history of this kind of matchup reflected there the Rose Bowl the Cotton Bowl the Rose Bowl and the last time it happened was the 1972 Orange Bowl the band's people flavor the envy on Poland wants you more let's call it for the sake of one word spirit you'll never find a group of people more intensely interested group of people who are gathered here in the Superdome because so many of them to see their favorite Dean's way and it's the first time that Penn State really is a man attention to on the field and win their first national championship hello everybody I'm Keith Jackson and talking about this national championship let's define it this way if the undefeated Nittany Lions win this ballgame today it seems a virtual certainty that they will be accorded the muster as national champions if Alabama should win today it would appear that we'll have to wait until all the voting is done in the polls and they are published because if Alabama wins today you know that USC for one has a rightful claim for some degree of recognition in that area you also know that Oklahoma if they should defeat Nebraska will be in a position to claim some firstplace votes as well so that's pretty much the simplest definition we can give you but I will tell you this that when we have the preseason polls before the first game was played Alabama was picked to be number one and then State was picked to be number three but that was a long time ago now we're going to settle the issue off the field of play and let's begin as Jim Lampley talks with the two quarterbacks the conversation recorded earlier Chuck you've Cena and Jeff Rutledge Chuck from a competitive standpoint this is obviously the most important game Penn State has played as a team in some time as you look at it personally how do you judge the importance of this game for you well without saying it probably is the most important game in Penn State history being because we have the chance to win the national championship on the field there have been other big games in Penn State that's in 72 and 69 they've had big orange school wins but then again after the wins that we didn't get a number one ranking we fill Penn State that if we can win this game there should be no question that we could be number one so therefore I think we're not only going to be playing for ourselves but for those teams have just got edge dot and for all other teams of Penn State who never got the chance to play for a national championship so you're playing for the identity of Penn State as a football program in all the years under Paterno and not just to prove that this team is the best in the country right now I think in a way we are you know we want to win this national championship for our team that's that's our first priority but all those other teams that we felt at Penn State were a little slighted or you know we I think they'll be celebrating this one as much as we will Jeff it's an understatement to say that this is an important game but what does the goal of a national championship and the fact that a national championship may hinge on the outcome of this game mean to you individually well that was the main reason I came to the University of Alabama to begin with was the chance to play for a national championship and my fourth year my senior year and it's finally here and the planned Penn State is certainly a an honor and a privilege you know they ranked number one in the nation and that's what footballs all about to reach the highest possible go you can reach and you know the winner of this game will probably be the national champion and that's what it's all about that's the reason I came to the University of Alabama hopefully the game's over there you know I can say I played on the national Supermarket the quarterback's Chuck Fusina and Jeff Rutledge most very good passers both imaginative quarterbacks and they have plenty of people to call on offensively first let's have a look at the ground troops that Penn State will be showing you today number 48 running at tailback is fuller more he's a sophomore 207 pounder he was second on the team in rushing this year with 602 yards scored six touchdowns for 16 passes and maybe the fastest of the Penn State backs sharing the tailback work with him is Mike cumin number 24 he's a junior 210 pounder one of the more versatile athletes on the field he started last year for Penn State as a defensive back this year moved back over to tailback where he ran for 351 yards the fullback number 32 Matsui and he is the tough runner ran for seven hundred and twenty yards he's also a good receiver with 26 catches he scored seven touchdowns this year and he's a little quicker than the first plants might reveal he does have four or five speed moving to the wide receiver position you have an outstanding athlete number 46 Scott Pitts key he holds the school career record for touchdown catches with 11 he is also the team punter with a 36 yard average and he is very dangerous when he goes deep now there is another young man who wears the number 10 who has to figure heavily in everybody's plans look at the staff 18 out of my team within 40 yards in the field goal holds virtually all of the kicking records Alabama good ground troops there too for example let's look at the left halfback out of the wishbone they call him touchdown Tony Nathan he's homegrown right in Birmingham he is just three yards short of his two thousand mark for his career and he has played a lot through all four years of his career there steady football player with enormous ability and he can break the long run almost anywhere at any time at fullback starting his Steve Whitman he's a big solid fellow at 235 pounds at a very good blocker but he's finally playing on healthy legs for the first time in a long time and he is double trouble counting up the middle there is a youngster on the right side of the wishbone number 42 a sophomore major Ogilvie he has delivered so many big plays for Alabama this season 186 Founder but he runs harder than that he's a very difficult fellow to bring down wide receiver number for Keith Pugh one of the most dramatic people I've ever seen at this position he had 20 catches the season and he will share the work at wide receiver today with senior Bruce Bolton are simply offensive people right there the Nittany Lions of Penn State have entered the Superdome Joe Paterno game against nipple along the way they had some other tough moments but toward the end of the season they were a very solid football team lost one time the USC in the third game of the season 24:14 won all the rest of them had some close calls but the bear praised his young people for their own SAT for the willingness to ignore circumstances and made life difficult for them and they just kept on winning and here they are with a chance they feel to win a national championship working with us as analyst and commentator today mr. Frank Broyles and frankly Brooklyn's considerably now about the offense but you and I both know that Joe Paterno and Bear Bryant build their football teams on defense well Penn State is the best defensive football team in the country reason is if they play hard and aggressive against the one in the back they probably shut it down completely and when they do watch out here comes a big rush and demoralize is most offensive units but I should point out that this is the first time in three years that Ben's late has faced the wishbone at that we have three allamerican defensive tackles out on the field today two of them play together in the Penn State Line Matt Millen and Bruce block Jimmy Bob native of Tennessee Keith used to say that the Lord is on the side of the team with the two best tackles and these two at Penn State are outstanding they could disrupt any offensive running attack and in put extreme pressure on the passer Alabama offers you Marti lions and some ferocious linebackers yet Lloyd Lines leads the team sprains enough as a down linemen in tackles at 112 and back Kraus is also an allamerican and he's big and strong and tough and knows how to play against the road what then can we expect in the way of offensive tactics well Alabama feels that they must use a variety of formations to play against a strong Penn State defense they feel like if they can shift and use man in motion they can keep the defense offbalance and then Keith they have a chance to set up the key play in the wishbone attack that's the fullback handle if they don't do this they cannot have a check they won't have a chance to run why all throw much one of the things that we have here other than the fact that we have two very good football teams about to play each other ranked one two we have two great coaches across the field from each other very definite key Joe Paterno is one of great football coaches this nation has we love and have to let people admire respected his players loving and he's a winner never respect and bam pride in the coach's opinion I think everybody is the greatest motivator of people the game has ever seen here after year Keith he can come up with a great football team his teams can never see complacency they give her very best when the best is needed that's enough conversation let's play the game we'll have the kickoff for you right after this I can tell by the happy mood you're in by that ever why dean witter smile a while away and the more you know about all our investment services the bigger your smile is gonna get me here's the new Pennzoil that saves gasoline and Kenny Stabler quarterback of the Oakland Raiders new Pennzoil PCL the Pennzoil that saves gasoline that's right you know the Pens all in this can it really does help you go farther on a gallon of gasoline and it saves you all changes they call it Pennzoil PCL I call it a winner every morning waiting for my rollon antiperspirant to dry look Roland's go on wet later they still stick to your shirt so I got on the stick men and speed stick speed stick is solid deodorant and even effective layer of deodorant protection that goes on dry so dry that speed stick never sticks to your shirt so don't get held up get on the stick men in speech Giuseppe Harris as he reached the 20yard line here is the offensive back field for the Crimson Tide of Alabama these pictures were taken at the court of two sisters the quarterback is the senior Jeff Rutledge Pony Nathan opens in half back major Ogilvie is the other halfback and Steve Whitman is the fullback in they're all from Birmingham and Bruce Bolton will open that wide receiver he's a senior from Memphis Whitman and motioned the pitch to the they bring him down 24 the offensive front the big guys for Alabama soffits they break down this way buddy at Alette number 78 is a tackle Mike Rock 235 watch Stevenson one of the best centers in the country and that's booth Jim buckshot a Mechanicsville Virginia and Rick Neal is the tight end it is second down we have a big eight officiating crew here working this ballgame the defensive setup for Penn State those are the officials bill Jennings the chief the referee cliff Squires Frank Ellis John the clinic man ups and an edge tenant and we have Tony Nathan shaken up on the play he's coming slowly off the field dragging a leg so on his second carry in the ballgame Nathan he takes a whack and Lou Eichner number 30 will go in the tailback to replace him Tony coming off under his own power but he appears to be hurting considerably but we will watch that development Tim Lampley is with us on the sidelines and we will have the information from the 27 it is third down and three Rutledge gives inside away to reach the 30 and it appears that he may well have gotten this first down the Penn State defensive people up front it's Larry poopin moose Clark corner Petruchio Macmillan and Joe Lally the linebackers to Penn State also a land snail and rich mulatto and the defensive secondary in Mike Gilson on power McCoy and he buries Pete Harris top interceptor in the country had a great season the ball is just beyond the 30 where it is first down now for Alabama and Frank Broyles they were able to get movement that time up the middle from their fullback Tony Nathan is out of the lineup dragging his leg whitman carries over the left side and Jeff Rutledge the Alabama quarterback took a pretty good lick after he had handed the ball away the gain is 1 yard they're icing down the hip for Tony Nathan as you see there for we're checking they have a bruise he could have a hip corner whatever he unloads it and there's the big guy we were talking about at the 31yard line as you see the big guy just roaring through and it's a virtual impossibility and we've got a little trouble with Frank Rawls microphone here right now but it's virtually impossible to block him one on one Bolton comes out of the lineup for Alabama a wide receiver now is Keith Pugh number four it is third down and nine from the 31 shut down they're unable to reach the firstdown marker at the 40yard line so good defensive flow by Penn State and now Alabama will come up for the first time leave that Rutley it's got a good taste of what the pass rush is Penn State has had all year long it's devastating like cumin and Matsui doubledeep to receive the punt of woody Humphrey Reuven overflows fair catch hump it knocks it out of bounds or ignore it kick back in he'll to the crowd of yard line he was looking for the coffin corner he didn't get it but he got it deep enough that the 12 here's Jim to tell us about Tony Nathan you take a look at Tony Nathan along the sidelines he's still being worked on by Alabama trainer Jim goose tree they say it's a bruise in the top part of the hip he doesn't seem to be hurt on the outside part of the hip in the hip pointer area they're putting ice on him they hope he'll be ready to go back in and play shortly but they're not certain how long it will take came over and took Keith's Penn State came out an unbalanced line the first plate of all game did find it upset Alabama's defense the play was successful but holding by the offense told you this is a neutral group of officials they're all from the big 8 conference the Penn State offensive backfield let's take a look at them while Alabama discusses the penalty call against the Nittany Lions Chuck Fusina is the quarterback Booker more will share tailback with Mike cumin Matsui the fullback and Bob Bassett Lakers scotf it's key the wide receiver will split in and the funner back to the 6 yard line where it will be first down and 15 for the Nittany Lions where he is grabbed and dragged down by Ricky Gilliland 92 defensive linebacker the Penn State offense in front her pinkie is a Tynan converted from taco Keith Dorne is the big guy up front Eric Cunningham Chuck Corral is the Center for Penn State Jim Romano a very good support guard Jim Brown a very good sophomore taco 13 the ball goes to Matsui to the sideline to hold him right at the 15yard line comin across Marty Lyons and Wayne Hamilton to make the tackle and welcome Anthony row are the ends they're both weighing less than coal Marty Lyons and Byron drags the tackles and the Warren Lyle to question is the middle guard the linebackers of Eric Claussen Rickey Gilliland the defensive secondary for Alabama McNeill Tremlett leg and Harris Jim Bob Harris is a freshman and replacing Rickey Tucker who without put into me Alabama's defensive flow Pierce Penn State does retain possession a photo passing down Alabama with the double coverage here's the rollout page that will receive a beat one shot both tuffet casino had to turn up the field run the football ball was knocked loose but they did recover McGriff knocked it loose Nobin recovered and over this back see in the front from Scott Witzke gets it away and major calls fair catch for Alabama up at the 44 yard line so the Vincent ID will have good field position for their second offense in possession of the ball game when more foreign car prices go up more it pays to put your money in a Chevy Chevette it's like money in the bank here's what makes it such a value this should that fourdoor hatchback has standard white stripe tires body side mouldings AM radio sports steering wheel console reclining front bucket seats and more yet Chevette is hundreds of dollars less than Toyota Datsun or VW Rabbit Chevy Chevette it's like money in the bank from Berkeley to Boston they know the best car on Eddie definitely my beer makes eleven million times a day of Regus freshly Tony nathan has been wrapped a little more and he's been jogging around now you see him running loosening up well back up the bench to see how the hip feels it's in the hip area and if Jim laughs they told us a bruise not appointed we expect we'll see Tony again before this ball game is done first down Alabama from the 44 yard line no schools first quarter number 84 there was good pressure from the inside Frank and here comes the Penn State defensive end we saw these two fellas against Maryland have big ballgames new banana until the turn o Keith has always believed in forcing the office he formerly doubts he's going to play aggressive and put all the pressure Ken brownie came flying across on the OP to play in collision of all care for Lawson outstanding play on his part Tony nathan is back in the lineup for Alabama at left half backed out of the wishbone with Whitman the fullback and oboe be on the right side back across the field States into the field remember locking buy at Alette and Brock watch them 1787 they did this is the mr. X screen the key to it is the acting of Rutledge going all the way over the right throwing fair Daisley across the field but the defense had reacted as they would expect and weather makes an outstanding run Louis's shoulder gets the extra yardage and his post go first and just a little bit short as the referee Phil Jennings will bring it back into the hash mark Tony Nathan back in the lineup having suffered a bruised hip but he ran on the field and this is the kind of a football game well you're not gonna let a little hurt stop you from playing in it absolutely not you're gonna be out there if you possibly get double tied in alignment now with Neil and Tim Travis in there Nathan oftentimes is the money man in this call Rutland pitches it back he's inside the 40 move a 39 yard line the Alabama backfield the yardage total may not be that impressive per man but look at the average for carry the reason it's not depressed in total eyes keepers they have four running backs mostly I formation teams and tailback will carry the ball 30 35 times but then the wishbone is even out across the backfield if they have success then they are good this Alabama football team so often here a mistake Rutledge salvage is it and Nathan gets the first down at the Penn State 13 handle to clean this time turns it up inside and he'll do that he'll stick his head in there and especially if those big defensive linemen of Penn State are coming so hard they overrun him Keith it appears that the defensive strategy is bring Milliman Clark through the gap misses what he did against Texas in the Cotton Bowl a few years ago and they disrupt anything down the line of scrimmage if you don't double D them and those numbers you just saw tell you how stingy to pay partner on the ground it is second down at about 7 yards to go and major Ogilvie 33 yard line where Bruce Clark makes the tackle Penn State's defense has five men lined up to play the run on both sides of the football his Clark you can see the quickness and agility of this man he wasn't he was away from the plate no one blocked if he goes right down the line and makes the tackle number 54 he was a linebacker as a freshman Keith and started 16 that shows his quickness third down and four for Alabama Penn State 33 which would half the ball in his hands he had Rick Neil there to block for him he might very well have scored he looked the other way didn't look the ball into his hands and Alabama misses the first guy that was a golden opportunity to make a big play even hospice for it was they what wonderful fake by Rutledge through the defense and Neil was going across the field and was wide open he threw a little bit on behind him and Wiggins right there the dropdown we've got the field goal try now for Alabama and doing the kicking will be Allen McElroy he will hit it out of Kevin Jones hold it is a 51yard field goal that's the first time this season that McIlroy has tried appeal go 50 yards or more and he missed it 7:44 to go first quarter no floor no I honestly do I honestly like Sears I wouldn't be here right now would I and I do like the junior Bazaar they have some really nice clothes you do keep current styles as far as the clothes and since I just got a new apartment I came here today to shop for and everything from curtains to lingerie here's this fantastic International Falls Minnesota a car sits on a frozen lake so January February and March it started thanks to up diehard the diehard sold only at Sears watch world news tonight weeknights on ABC inside the Superdome 72 degrees outside it's about 50 degrees and raining and kind of damp and cold but all across the country there is some real tough weather Dallas for example chill factor of minus 10 snow ice just about everything you can walk that's uncomfortable over there today the upper middle west we're told as being battered by a winter storm we feel very fortunate to be inside the dome for the 79 Sugar Bowl game penn state gets the bowl at the 33 the line of scrimmage since they missed the kick under the rules they get it back up where the stem from and Fusina goes over the middle Ricky Gilliland 18yard game tipet was an outstanding troll Bob Fusina he drops back fakes to the tailback to try to freeze the linebacker massive 81 breaking in front of the safe demand Riedel target took hers back catches hit it makes a big reception first down just over midfield for Penn State the first time they've had the ball in Alabama territory Alabama's linebackers back in behind their defensive guards and tackles well opposite blockers cannot get to them and when you run straight ahead they are likely to hit you on many pages nose guard for Alabama now second down and nine you see here comes Mary cross Frank putting a lot of heat on a few seen I think Chuck might have had to throw it before he wanted he ran right through and forced in the move just a little bit to the left as you seen it was offbalance he would've been dead ahead he's not throwing the ball it was way off target but look at the inception that leg Lakes right they's all Southeastern Conference issue at his first down Alabama the football is just outside the 33 yard line Rick Neal wide to the right but that stands up and throws out anything he tried the onehanded Carl McCoy defending for Penn State here again mayor says he's going to have to throw playaction passes overly bad after try to keep Miller than Clark from Jeff's running back and disrupted his hoppin Neal was all foggy but he missed six minutes and 40 seconds and you can see that Penn State has been a relatively careful football team turnovers this season they don't make that mistake molding his wife to the right Nathan on the left he crosses the 42 the 43 white Stevenson the Center for Alabama number 57 is on prey level football player he's a big guy 63 230 pound junior out of Hampton Virginia and he's about as good as you'll see in that position the Alabama coaches say could be the best plugged in the history of their school and Ojeda mitsuna is an added bonus for this wishbone attack third down they need a little bit less than a yard and Rutledge writes to us I told you at the very beginning that Steve is playing on to sound legs with jeans and the 235 pounds reps don't fight stop let's look at it give this the first place the triple option he's bridled his scene pantheon hit the line of scrimmage but he is a determined football player 235 found gets in the secondary and makes a big play very key for them to have that success early the ball game inside that's the key to the wishbone 44 yard line of Penn State Rutledge second man goes down that on the sidelines through the flag Penn State players say it's against Alabama they're pointing backwards so that's a tough break for Alabama talking there to the defensive captain that is Paul Shuey the brother of Matsui beam yarder coming up against the Crimson Tide that gets very moving around a little because they seemingly had some momentum going just cut through there on his own effort made the play watch Stephenson number 57 he's one of the outstanding blocker did you see he comes in on the nose man he keeps his feet we call that lucky goal maintaining position and not falling on your face Stephenson there's a great one 49 yard line now where it's first down and 15 in state defensive front lats male made the tackle but Ogilvy had a lot of convoy to get him through there he was from the I formation again which means you turn in picks the ball he's closer to the Enron he has great speed and termination the he and run wasn't fair but he turned up he turned up with a burst of speed and determine the run through blocked us and he did 10 yard game Billy Jackson replacing Steve Whitman for a play but Whitman is now back so you have Nathan go to the iformation and said Nathan why the left side Toby he wanted to work a little flea flicker I think he wanted to get that ball back to his quarterback but the Penn State defensive people didn't give him time Lance Mel the linebacker number 56 is an outstanding football player the leading tackler he played no scarred last year so in the line he has a good knack of going through and he tackled oval day before he could laddle of all back teeth to exactly right it was a flea flip to play with Neal down deep in the hit behind the safety man it is third down now for Alabama have played 42 yard line Neal goes out as a flicker hands it off inside to the fullback reaches the 38 there and he goes down in a heap again male is involved on the tackle along with Bruce Clark number 54 if they feel that they were running on third down thinking that they would get a big blitz and maybe have a chance to surprise Penn State and pop up the middle but at least they didn't drop back for a pass and get thrown for a big loss like a lot of teams did all season long against this great Penn State defense but Stevenson has come out now that means it is putting time and Don Jacobs who is a specialist at killing the ball Pete even hit the knuckleball so here was a gadget play and they used too much time he had to get it on a quick snap to get it away but if they're gonna punt the ball anyhow now I'm sure it's relatively academic they were going to run a plate keep what they were doing they've gotten Penn State to substitute there plenty return team and taken their regularly face out and so they were gonna make a pub run up run a play and hopefully make a first down there's one of the best at gadget plays in the history of this game nobody has caused the rules to be rewritten more than Paul Brian tell me about it I've been on the committee I'm free hiphop beauty instead of ricocheting toward the corner if out straight in a 43yard punt we have three minutes and 13 seconds to play in the first quarter no score I'm Howard Morgan the TV weatherman in Albuquerque New Mexico we have a lot of Sun out here and a good year tiempo is the all season tire that runs whisper quiet on sunny days and on rainy days goodyear tiempo is the rain tire that keeps us moving in the nearby mountains it's also a snow tire goodyear tiempo is the rain tires snow tire Sun tire one tire that does it all tiempo is the original all season tire only from goodyear i've played out of some monsters before but this one's something else it's the Terrax titan the world's largest truck it's the Big Daddy and the Tareq's line of off highway equipment equipment used worldwide for mining logging and heavy construction whether it's playing golf or moving mountains you need the right iron baby that's a lot of iron Penn State's Chuck Fusina UCLA spiel des sprout Charles Alexander of LSU postseason action on the hula ball Saturday on ABC Joe Paterno the head football coach at Penn State University fine man Bryan almost well he's a legend a hit man at Alabama Penn State's ball first now after 20 made a mistake left side of the lion jumped Jim Brown number 75 jumped before the ball was snapped illegal procedure against the Lions and that gets a grimace from the head coach worth pointing out I think that Alabama against the Penn State defense is 1 for 67 yards already and if you remember penn state allowed only a little more than 54 per game during the season in fact one team Keith rushed for over 100 yards syracuse got 113 but the reason is I think is that Penn State has not seen the wishbone at home and they take the LOB get a customer in just a tooth the speed with which bone possesses first down and 15 from the 15foot Penn State same motion you see gives to the up man out of the eye Sooey bangs in there for a couple of yards up to maybe the 18 call it second down and seven and three minutes to go in the first quarter and it's a tight tense defensive football game right now both teams however have shown us that they have brought some funny looking babies they both have Penn State's been handicapped with two penalties on two of their three possessions deep in their territory tough to make a first now have to get a penalty in danger zone and it is incomplete defending his Helen from way at number 17 he ran all the way with it they got a little tangled up going down the sidelines but the official was right with him you we can see this key going on the deep pattern he's going to try test crumbly who is noted to be kind of slower put you might say and you see a little pushing and shoving there if this accidental most of the time the officials will ignore it unless the ball is white there was way overthrown and officials thought it was not interference and so for Penn State it is third down and 12 from their own 18 yard line with two and a half minutes to go in the first quarter we'll get a new football that young men there is Ricky Tucker but he was injured in an easy workout the other day a freak accident and he is the free safety for this ball club and a very important figure and they're going to miss him I bet you before the day is done to the pudding so they'll have to kick it away from the 19yard line as byron brags a big sophomore ran down the Penn State quarterback I think the Penn State coaches felt that vecina was gonna have to have a great day hitting the third down passes the critical situations but he has not so far in the game it's good to punt he'll hit it from about his 13 major Obama is beaten Alabama's going to get good field position here oh they'll be receiving it at the 42 knocked down back at the 41 good downfield coverage by the Nittany Lion 92 Rick Donaldson down there and this Saturday on ABC stride World Sports live from Honolulu our hula bowl at 4:00 Eastern 3 central in 1 Pacific and they have a tremendous gathering of athletes to participate in this year's hula bowl just look at those names that's a who's who in Dallas football of 78 just beyond the 41 Alabama first down for the tide go back one foot is in motion that is Nathan Alabama is running against Penn State that play goes all the way to the 42 good for 16 yards he that was the quick flip the quick picks Nathan watch it right here but you'll see the key is Whitman's block and the key also being Nathan's faking inside setting up his block right there by Whitman breeze him into the secondary and watch him low that shoulder like a good back sure that's outstanding football player Colton a through have at 6.9 balls his career at Alabama Rick Neal taking on the play he will come off the field but you can see he's walking easily and his first to be alright Tim Travis replaces him 212 pound junior from Bessemer our best winners right in the Birmingham area Nathan now has gained 31 yards on four carries it is Alabama's ball first down Penn State 42 with a minute 34 to go in the first quarter no score maybe and check off an inaudible here is Rutledge took a long time makes it to the 38 yard line of Penn State most of the football game has been played on Penn State's into the field the reason is at Penn State cannot make the first down while they're people they're in a feeling when you punt the football then Alabama has very good field position Penn State jumped into a 5 3 on that occasion right now and that was the first time they've used it it here's Notre Dame leading Houston six to nothing in the first quarter Frederico Chi number 83 defensive in Keith what happened on that play is most intimate I like to point out they went to Bob freeze and complain before they hit the handoff this time they showed him the Bob free move over into a nova ship and that villain came flying through him disrupted everything in the backfield good defense it called Wallace back at day 42 third down stumbling coming off the snap right there is number 16 Matt Millen to pounce on him lost his back to the 45 again almost wash today he almost he's lucky to fall back on the ball in a situation like that and so the first quarter is history in this 1979 super bowl game and there is no score between Alabama and Penn State we begin the second quarter of play in the game here in the Sugar Bowl between topranked Penn State numbertwo ranked Alabama woody Humphrey is in to kick for Alabama on fourth down shoot it for the corner inside the poor one yard and here are the numbers on the first quarter and look at the yards rushing from Alabama 81 yards which is to several more than the team made last year that skew to the average last year 55 yards time of possession 10 minutes for Alabama and 36 seconds only four for Penn State they've got to make some first downs and they down backed up for absolutely necessary very careful down here Bob Tori the bull is the tailback five maybe the six yard line he is the quickest of the Penn Stater running backs Notre Dame now has moved out to a 12 nothing lead in the frigid Cotton Bowl and Dallas says Buchanan has run it in from a yard for the Irish bitter cold day in Dallas at the six yard line it is second down double wide to the right side you see that gives it get him inside the five years an allamerican at work number 93 Marty Lyon Marty lines is an allamerican football player you can see him just charged through trying to get penetration guys and leaps and the great effort to stop for a loss always back at the three yard line between the three and the four but the end zone it is Tory and more gonna be close to the first down Warren wild the freshman nose guard for Alabama had fought his way through the traffic and was pursuit of you Cena in the end zone and Chuck calm poised senior quarterback wanted to go deep his death kicked off his fullback and let's see where the ball is he that shows the poise in the confidence call Fusina behind his own goldmine a game like this he didn't get rattled he found this alternate receiver as Satan Pao got the ball out to them and nearly made a first man obviously pens staple but I'm going to fiddle around and get some better the ball down there at this point of the ball game for 1302 to go an inch interesting think Penn State's kick formation Falls to Alabama coaches one solid week of preparation to know what they did they afraid of a pass rate of the run from this formation is not used by it but then some phobias feet for Alabama once again viscous putt Ogilvie fair catch first down Alabama after own heavy yes you really have much field position in the ball game not giving them the opportunity to unwind their offense the Penn State undefeated four times never named National Champion and right now we see for the first time at the ball game number 10 Tech Minh City and quarterback for Alabama good runner Villa Jackson before back lectures after lover bitches it outside behind the line of scrimmage Matt Miller pouring in Schiele was actually hip he faked to his fullback and then was hit but still was able to deliver the pitch well I think most of time the coaches would ask ceiling when he's hit before he comes out clearly to attack the defensive end keep them all and take the laws don't take a chance on pitching but Bear Bryant has come first in this young man to put him in a game like this in this situation three second down thirteen feeling with it too big chuckles never gave him a chance to exercise the option watts Park number 54 just shoot the gap inside the tackle number 63 bunch is trying to block him to Boyd fail he has the quickness then when he sees that ball snap he can penetration and he makes an outstanding play and I'm serious demoralizing the Alabama offense at this point of the game 60 mil enjoy Z so Stedman Schiele peppered and salted that comes out Rutledge's back in the footballers at the forty where it is third down and 18 and Rutland shins pok\u00e9vision motion and it'll bring up fourth down and a gifting down for Alabama with 11 minutes and 10 seconds to play in the second quarter no score deep in space defense have had their backs to the wall a little bit field position those toothache tackles are just as we said they are sensational they're also probably getting a little more feel of that wishbone yes it takes time you cannot practice with a beat team or simulating a great game like Alabama Chris kick another beauty he almost hit the screen hanging in the roof Sooey but no way because Humphrey what do you hung it up there five full seconds do you know me I was the first to fly in the highest mountain in the world but down here people don't always recognize me so I got an American Express card because people do recognize this as a sign of success and accomplishment around the world sure it's tougher to get that doesn't mean you have to climb Mount Everest to get one to apply for a card look for this display wherever the card is welcomed the American Express card totally fine without it new Chevrolet a new generation car bought and embraced by more than a million people in its first two years Caprice an Impala for 1979 for the 18th consecutive year it's the best in professional bowling premiering January 6th on AVC the Pro Bowlers tour big Bruce Clark there on the sidelines when his teammates allamerican in 1978 and the thermal a Defensive Player of the Year only a junior so is milind only a junior all the coaches on the schedule of Penn State for next year trying to figure out right now how to handle it yeah in the Cotton Bowl in Houston Houston's on the board in Dallas I should say as the Davis is thrown to Adam 15 yards for a touchdown in the second quarter that's a 127 ballgame 942 to go here he's got that open but he's running for his life now he dumps it made a diving try you Cena running for his life pursued by Curtis McGriff and watching casinos trying to throw the look in pass they double covered receiver they guess correctly old defense Alabama forced him out of the pocket you see the old throws and if all bounces like fruit off with his hands up in and watch leg dive bucks hip and right here on the right of your screen he came close with in a sensational play if he coulda grabbed Penn State has not run more than any in any possession more than three plays so it's been one two three kick beyond the 15 by Matsui 211 pounds junior from State College and this trial his team has had the best office so far they were ready to play they've got good field position they've been able with their defense and kicking the main play field position and keep Penn State backed up that's the mark of a good football team Joe Paterno has sent Bob Torre in at fullback replacing sewer here that's the tendon now Booker more of the tailback and for a the fullback from the 17 I expected back into a deep position defensively the pressure is on 96 the linebacker crowd blitz and forced him to his wife and he ran right at Hamelin the strategy key laws that they showed the safety blitz you seen a horrible a pass they changed and went back in double cover and put on the Blitz they go 14 yard loss and standing right at the very back of the endzone his fits give the fun motivate to receive Alabama once again the five figures to get courage with fear position pressure on gets it away both of a field at the Penn State 41 with 909 to go in the second quarter and Alabama continued will play on ten states into the football field this program is special exclusive ABC sports that's cause five separate to allow our local stations to identify themselves in Birmingham this is td6 that comes up now with the first down at the 41 Lu Eichner and Billy Jackson along with nature Ovaltine teichner flexing out over this phone over the right side of the big center Stevenson moves it down close to the 37 for 4 yards most people tried to release their weak side blockers on the plate to the left for instance but you better not do that on ploy he's right over there you better leave somebody old to block you key however go back to the very beginning where we talked about establishing the run out of the wishbone and the key to that is the center's play against the nose guard and Stevenson's doing the job so far here's the pitch opening with it to the 34 we're last male linebacker it makes the stop there we explain a lance mail their linebacker number 56 takes on the block nearly gets knocked down but then he scrapes off makes the tackle alone plea over after a nice game that time Frank Penn State had gone to a fourman front let's see how they line it up this time Penn State almost nothing on the ground so far this first half but it was Clark who made the first contact what do you do with a number 54 it weighs 268 pounds he's quick enough to play linebacker she can't hold his way through there and makes the play on the draw play on Jackson sensational continued play by Bruce Clark the football is sitting at the Penn State 38 yard line it is fourth down and six the job he goes for the other corner this time but he won't get there touched in the end zone rick neil was down there but he lost his footing a little bit was wobbling around and hit the ball in the end zone 7eleven to go no school in first half settling the national championship on the field of play topranked Penn State which has been held to only eight yards rushing so far in the ballgame by the Alabama defense no score however in the game of seven eleven to go in the first half Penn State's ball first down it is surion boomin lined up behind casino cumin close to the 25yard line running over the left side running behind Keith Dorney and Eric Cunningham we got some movement that time he's on the left side of the line they moved Alabama defense back enough but ghulam to see those they like do that and cut right through like suey a little bit quicker than you really think at first but you can see how much sided it's been so far but there is no school gives him a first down and suddenly they're out close to the 35 yard line with the first guy losing out a little bit where they can set up the fashion and maybe take advantage of what the scouting report says Alabama is vulnerable to pass defense they doubled up that time on the middle guard and wrote him out of there and soui cut right through the hole and it's near the 35 he would flip sling and heat referee bill Jennings out of the big 8 walking off the penalty against Penn State the illegal procedure 31 yard gain wiped out beautiful execution Bob Dafina on the Flitz hitting the back gunman watches white white it'll be first down in 15 as you see the replay screens are set up by the acting of the quarterback and you Cena did an outstanding job right there is Romano the left guard number 53 was out in front of you make the block my Clements in at quarterback replacing Ellen from River Alabama but faster than motion for Penn State and maps up to the 35 yard line that's just beyond the original line of scrimmage so it's going to bring up second down and about ten Penn State averaged 25 passes again for 11 during the season Alabama coaches thought they might see as many as 40 or 45 because of the vulnerability of their secondary there's the time remaining on the school board in the Superdome Torrey is in at fullback now boomin stays at tailback is a 226 round soon a little bit bigger they wanted turnover Penn State did recover the football and maintain possession as lamanno a guard in fast walking formation Saurus quarterback in trouble and came back to get the ball watch Lucina they had two safety blitz number 90 is back in their horses and out of the pocket rags come aboard his seven slips them all loose and number 53 Romano the left guard recovers for Penn State very outstanding effort on his part and the ball is all the way back at the 14th for the Lions they still own it got a go to the 48 almost the 45 for a first town though they Krag again involved on the play with Crouch 77 hustling over there along with number 90 Boyd and it's fourth down and once again Penn State's Fitz P will have to punt but near his own goal line and once again Alabama is going to get the ball in very good field position he found a little bit surprised and overly has made a fair catch on every one of the putts 50 and he has had some Running Room they peel back for return this time and it's Fitz his best punt hanging it high and forcing him to call their cat she hung it up there five seconds it was a 38 yard front Alabama's ball first down at their own 47 I want something to drink fiddle with beers get away necklace something special oh boo the Schlitz malt liquor pool it's a special premium brew that's in a class by itself magnificent tastes nebulous you may have either of my daughter's hands in marriage I can tell by the happy mood urine by that everwidening nor investment program is designed around you and no one else so you can't help smiling when you do for much so my offensive talk on the football right now first down and it's close to the 47 yard line nathan is on the field but they're not using him to return punts after you hurt that hip early in the going Logan has it first down at the Penn State 38 yard line here we see both in number 32 going down as if he's going deep Gillis lenders covered him and close to making a great play it was underthrown but golden came back and wrestled of all three in a house standing play here's again a vacant option play fake the fullback and then throw the pegs native 16 yards just inside the bench 38 on the option wants to throw the screen there the Alabama fool back in at the big play to the 22 in one thing it was the storage a big rush is a screen pass and have subsist on it and a screen back away from the flow is very difficult depend again outstanding execution by one Rutledge Jamil throw the first block done at Alette and then Brock and its first down at the Penn State 22 yard line no score 320 to go first half play both in the middle the Brooklyn the fullback carries and he's inside the 24 the 18 yard line he's got just about four yards on that tear up call it three and you see now time I was getting closer and closer most of this first half has been played on the Penn State end of the field second down Penn State is deep in Alabama territory more here now they've got two men on Clark they've got bucket but here's Clark forces the fool and I know that here's Clark making him move to the left and throw off ballast Whitman deflected the ball and the lot makes an outstanding run back 55yard return for the interception first down Penn State at the Alabama 37 yard line and don't forget that bar you see hit headon by linebacker barrack the interception 37 yard line second down and 10 no gain on the carry by Sooey so far what if all the way was gone McNeil number 28 never say 50 running the flower pattern but Don McNeil number 28 gives in plenty of cushion runs right with it plays the bowl but you want to eat this is back to do is wait to the last instant and be sure you jump while the bowl that his height and that's exactly what he does and he knocked it away it is third down in ten Penn State from the Alabama 37 blank fifteen and so Penn State is jerked right out of field goal range that ears the punch went into a quick formation kicked the ball before Alabama had lined up to a retreat trying to knuckleball it down there but it took it bounce on the carpet and what end it'll be Alabama first down at the 20 the big news for 79 is from Chevrolet the new shitty Mons a 2+2 hatchback is more car for less money and a lot more kicks now standard equipment includes tinted glass AM radio shift console sports steering wheel white stripe tires body side molding bucket seats carpeting the hatchback and more all standard

has been much more advantageous from those at Penn State in this ball game Alabama gained in 84 yards on the ground Penn State is minus seven on the ground chuck Racine has been sacked RUP that's burns and hands the ball off that keep it inside to the 2122 major Ogilvie carrying the clock now show in just about a minute to play in the first half here was Penn State sitting down on the 37 yard line with a vehicle opportunity as you see time call for the Lions to kill the clock and suddenly the big sack them Fusina by Bragg's took them right out of field goal opportunity this Saturday on ABC the season premiere of the Pro Bowlers tour and on ABC's Wide World of Sports the hula bowl from Honolulu the Pro Bowlers tour just goes on year after year after year as one of the most watched of all of our sports program up in the coal country that's about all you can do got do something indoors 2:30 Eastern Time any thoughts of the Superdog being reflected they're going back to that loss stone of the past attempt by a casino I know that he wishes you've gone and thrown the ball away receivers recovered brethren prata scramble it makes something big because he was in field goal range in the hadith prophet the greatest kicker in america said ahead of three points banished one thing about those life will look and have two friends under trunks it's certain positions on that field it's hard to see it's second down and 70 Rutledge Springs it out there Nathan coming across number sixtyfour big 256 founder from hook and aqua pennsylvania and another timeout by Penn State with 49 seconds to play in the first half move Nathan out to Franco back for that particular play of the screen he was lined up this student wide receiver and his green to him hoping that he could make a run after he called the football it'll be third down they need two yards for the first down as Penn State kills the clock and you can see the story now on Penn State's points of possession they have not been particularly good teeth in the season long statistics Penn State is not marched for a touchdown over 60 yards but 11 times so you can see they play conservative play defense and kick the ball and their type of offense which is power inside no option play not a scramble quarterback it's hard to have a consistent drive of seven or 80 yards the scoreboard shows two timeouts remaining to Penn State but I don't believe they have one remaining no score 49 seconds to play as he arrives it over the right side to the 33 and the clock stopped one more time at 44 seconds to go in the first half now let's see a fence state spends her last timeout Box Tops while the chains are moved in college football I think why end up the clock it is rolling and here's Jim Lampley Keith I just talked to Stedman Sheila the reserved Alabama quarterback a couple minutes ago they're having a big problem with Bruce Clark and they're going to start to doubleteam him all the time I'm the buck that broken loose came from one glance Stevenson to its booth that was elected by let's see it no false fake they're in the backfield but seeing this run you'll watch that Nathan is wise enough to break out and pick up the block of number 32 Bruce Bolton is wide receiver has a chance to go all the way with that clock right there but he gets caught from behind by number 92 Britt Donald yeah Rick Collison Nathan now 30 yards on that run for carries 53 yards 21 ticks remaining on the first half clock and suddenly it is Alabama now that's down in position for hammers to get three points that Penn State wishes they had induced those timeouts and let the clock run out Alabama had a little resourcefulness to run that type of play on that situation when they were expecting a pass and playing salt Alabama calling the time here they have two remaining and MacElroy on the sidelines is moving around he tried one from 51 yards and it was short he has no history that districts they've got to move him down a little bit closer for him to really be in range but on a day like this and a game like this under these circumstances you never know how much he's jacked up how much more he can get last night in the blue bonnet ball giorgia 2522 here's the pitch to Nathan with 15 seconds to play in the first half Alabama has one timeout remaining Penn State has one timeout remaining Rutledge comes to the sidelines to talk to the offensive the most offensive thing on that Alabama sideline is a man named Paul William Bryant he is a master of this particular situation he's been here many times he has the feel in the sense of a football game and he's talking right now trying to decide is what's the best way to make seven or eight yards if and put the ball in the middle of field getting in the range of their field goal kicker McElroy McElroy has tried one time between forty and forty nine his longest being 41 yards and he made it if they attempt to pass from here Keith and it's incomplete they would have to kick a field goal from the 36 that would be four to six yards a little bit out of his range coming up at halftime will have a fireman's fund flashback featuring highlights at that 1973 Sugar Bowl game but and Notre Dame football is sitting just inside the Penn State 31 waking up diving a bullet from his quarterback Jeff Rutledge Kevin Jones tuhoe McIlroy for the extra point try score of the game comes with 8 seconds to play in the first half so it is the senior split in Memphis Tennessee Bruce Colton with the first pick big play of the game Alabama had done their homework because Harris the safety man came up to pick up the pine tea and crossing and polka goals in bhai situation again right here what an epic cradles the ball right in this one's building right here goes down deep and breaks across the middle it's not saying they've done their homework because these hairs had come up number 21 McCoy was trying to cover him right there manful man with harris supporting on the tidy in he could not boot he's open the ball gets there just on top called a big touchdown it's centered nothing Alabama with 8 seconds to play in the first half Rutledge now 6 out of 10 for 86 yards in the touchdown they lay the ball down what is it an onside ER or will those just hope there gets to alignment where they cannot return it gets the chalk on the sidelines we'll bring it back marked off five and kick it again mean I think we ought to go back ignition of Penn State use their timeouts back deep for the Alabama territory to try to force a kick but Alabama made the first down gave them and consequently a big run by Nathan gave them an opportunity to score Nathan was the play that ignited Alabama put him down in position but it was a picture play as Matt Millen had the pressure on Rutledge just took one half step up and milind just miss grabbing him were lawful to play a game of football simply put is a acquisition of real estate I've heard it so many times but it's also a game of inches like so many other sports contests and that was the result Grill to the fullback Tori they kick receiving formation for Penn State and Bob comes back to the 45 yard line and is four seconds to play gets the ball first down at the 45 with Alabama on top by a score of 7 to nothing they've officially credited Rutledge and Bolton on a 30 yard or the touchdown two senators back here but Jesus made a very big decision that produced the 30yard touchdown pass what was your reasoning on second down of 15 seconds left in the half go to classes and then go for the field goal we still have two times two out of time how that would always stop the clock what he was gonna throw the ball away with his man was coverage attorney I would be wide open even say it in that played you think it'd work only what was before he got trapped back there but we have flemish never any right yeah we got to do something about that idea that's doing great okay good luck thanks for visiting with us coach Bear fry you just made the big decision that produced the touchdown the 30yard pass from Rutledge to Bolton we'll be back with halftime festivities from the Sugar Bowl right after this the halftime show here at the Sugar Bowl has run a little bit long on the field and both coaches have brought their teams onto the field a good four or five minutes ago consequently the players have been standing around and as I stand here with you thank you very much Richard Todd is among those down on the sidelines and we may very well have an opportunity to talk to him the last time Alabama and Penn State played here in the Sugar Bowl Richard Todd was the big man as he led Alabama to a 132 64 victory so here we go with the second half of play and one of the questions Frank Broyles I have for you do you think that Alabama may gamble a little bit and try to go oneonone with millon and double up on Bruce Clark absolutely I think they're going to have to I talked to Bo Ryan North Carolina State about Clark and Dillon he said if you don't doubleteam Clark you'll give you Fitz all day long and that's what's happened I believe Alabama will make that path will change and till Colonel has got the dislodge from his players minds and disappointments and the frustration to the offense whether he can have some enthusiasm in this hand McIlroy will kickoff for Alabama and Penn State's Donovan Surrey and Cole's are deep Donovan drifts back to the goal line to ticket he's in the end zone bring it out to the 20 we're Penn State will have the ball first and ten the offensive back wheel will go with Fusina boom ensuing bassett at the flanker spot and it'll be Fitz Cadorna Cunningham Corral Romano brown and panky upfront Penn State wearing the white shirts trailing by a score of 7 to nothing there were 7 rushing in the first half and the passing wasn't anything to write home about it the reason was the safety blitz and the linebacker blitz just infused him and Doc Pitino out of his past patterns all right let's see what Chuck comes up with here he fetches diptych cumin cumin cumin to the right side getting some milk about the 24 yard line it'll be second down in six is Ricky Gilliland number 92 knocked him out of bounds Alabama's defensive front pictured here and their horses as Wayne Hamilton who plays a defensive end Marty Lyons the allamerican tackle Warren Lyle's the young nose guard Byron Bragg's who had a tremendous first half Gary de niro defensive end and I'll say one more time doesn't anybody ever say hello dad and six from the 24 off the block and nails Duman hit him salat brought him right down at the 25 the linebackers for Alabama along with the defensive backs the backers of Barry Kraus and other allamerican number 77 and Ricky Gilliland 92 Don McNeal is a quarterback Alan crumbly in and out of the game Murray leg is the safety and a very good one and Jim Bob Harris the young freshman playing the free safety spot in place that injured Ricky Tucker it is third down and five Kushina trying to set up a screen gets it off the soil diagnosed to play and was in exactly the right place at the right time you Cena had drifted back and the Penn State people had left Alabama's charge come on through but leg was right there that was a double screen deeply faked at the one side through back to the other but Murray leg was right there johnnyonthespot new sugarbowl appendix all reflected there it's his part is very very high but not all that long and he doesn't get it all it takes an Alabama but they near the 44 yard line and so the time once again gets very good field position for fun actually travel only 29 it'll be Rutledge Nathan Ogilvie and Whitman this those are the people we extract Bolton at Alette Brock Stevenson booth bunch Neal comes to the sidelines now and Tim Clark number 80 is in there so let's see what bears gonna open with here oh my goodness he's got three people way out they go to Clark the wide receiver screen there's a penalty flag it's kind of fun but it didn't gain anything and probably going to cost him because somebody was out of position those are the kind of plays you used on the practice field to keep him interested on Thursday keys or maybe on Friday before the ball games Alabama had motion I think because they didn't have seven men on the line of scrimmage and the three men the right and three men the left one of them failed get up on the line scrimmage fail Jennings who heads the big eight officiating team will define it for us as soon as he has placed the ball he's joined by cliff Squires Frank Ellis John la cl\u00ednica Shannon Van Eps and and Larry : here is announcement procedure on the line on the read down one didn't have enough folks up on the line of scrimmage right Frank yes la gunshot again first and 15 Calma coin I mean it right the number that was the break that Penn State needed to fire their team up get him aroused that's that first half what Rutledge throw the ball right to McCoy number 21 right holding the numbers boy is he disappointed and is the team disappoint there he's shaking his head it'll be second down and 15 was back inside the 39 early in the ballgame he's just grinding his teeth and forgetting it and he turned in a hard run right there the defensive front for Penn State now and we'll give you a close look at these big horses Joe Lally who's had a big play in the ballgame at N there's big Matt Millen at Toni Petruchio that has the chore of Gordon gets Stephenson Bruce Clark that big Bruce and Larry kuben sophomore out of New Jersey football is just short of midfield where it is third down and four watch the flow does pass both the ball could have been caught but he went right through his hands the linebackers for Penn State and Alabama gets ready to punt all these gentlemen Paul Suey the brother of Matt defensive captain Lance male who's played very well for the lives rich mulatto at that big interception in return Mike Gilson and the defensive secondary along with Carl McCoy who just dropped that interception a moment ago Pete Harris the safety what a kick by um prick well that's a cannon shot it's owned through the inzone 50yard punt by woody unfree 1243 to go in the third quarter Alabama leads Penn State by a score of seven to nothing four days you fought the mountains for a 90ton slap of granite and now you hold your breath why'd you bring it out until it swings free now comes Miller time time to head for the best tasting beer you can find Miller High Life when it's time to relax time to relax one deer stands Chevrolet invites you to think of yourself in a new Monte Carlo think of yourself surrounded by crisp sculptured lines think of yourself enjoying the very real pleasures of honing a Monte Carlo think of yourself surrounded with personal luxury quiet comfort and a surprising amount of room but when you thought about it come drive one and put a little distance between yourself and the crowd over and bridgett Dallas in the Cotton Bowl Houston's Swift Cougars have jumped out to a 28 to 12 halftime state trailing seven nothing with the ball first down at their the penalty flag on the field may be against Alabama personal foul flipping Alabama so instead of having the ball they've been state 14 they'll be back up around the 19 a 22 yard return by Jim Bob Harris know that interception you see no bake to the tailback and this key is open in the middle but casino has to have lost some of his confidence he ordinarily would hit him right there Mulder throws it Harris right on the numbers and the young freshman from Athens Georgia and the quarterback who led his team to the state championship in Georgia 14 old season makes a fine run but the clip moves them back let's see if we can see the clip Yeah right back there behind it well whatever it's all he was open Chuck just miss Cooper to me just missed and that's what happens when you lose a little bit of companies call us back at the 34yard line from the part of the bow still in good field position as they give it to me I sort of wondered if the Alabama decided to double up on Clark and go one on one with melon if I might not make Matt a little matter and he might play with a little more intensity at that time he certainly did he just whipped the blocker and was right there at the line of scrimmage the ball Cara got they released from the blocker and made the time momentum got him to second bound eight double wide left double got three people over on the right side that same formation and they've got Nathan over here and Clark over the other side the same thing not having enough people up on the line of scrimmage okay what's happening is two of the men on each side are in the backfield and only one up on the line of scrimmage in three and two is five well I don't call it that way this time Frank they go offside against Penn State oh yeah he sort of get the feeling bears been looking at that plane kind of likes it and said we're gonna keep running if you guys get it right and he's going to throw it out one of these times and throw a labral to it and make the halfback throw a pass down the field he's done that before I've seen it it was off this formation both at Rutledge threw the interception while ago that was dropped and I say interception that was dropped because he hit at Austin 5 moving the ball just inside the 28 11:55 to go in the third quarter and Alabama's sitting on a seven nothing lead well the number one 25yard line he's got to go just inside the 24 for the first down so he'll have third and very short again Bruce Clark was in the backfield and redirected Nathan outside he would like to run over the tackle but he had to change his course and lost his momentum you can see that nathan has gained 84 yards more than the Penn State running game that's incredible keith is just nearly unbelievable New York both Jim Munsch and white Stevenson for the first down he's like a fallen tree when he gets going they moved in unbalanced line which Luke Locke a man wide of prey they could run the handle for the ball back over the tackle the Clark was way out over the end because the unbalanced line wellprepared football team Nathan limping some comes off the field and Eichner goes in at they halfback position for Alabama pushed down just beyond the 21 yard line of Penn State Whitman the fullback up over the left side this time and he reaches the 19 at 11 o'clock that time or at Alette in particular if Nathan absorbing wicked blow on the hip very early in the ballgame he had ice massage and so forth has played very very well running for 82 yards if he produced the big 30yard run and really set up Alabama's touchdown late in the first half that was the key run its second down from the 19 yard line he gets planted by a blitzing rich the lot from the linebacker position and a lot just nailed it here he comes watch number 28 the whole opus up beautifully for him and he is able to hit college in the back field right there 28 11 and that was a key play it made a third and 10 third down in 10 then let's see what the bear has suggested to his quarterback actually lost on the play back to around the 24 yard line the great pursuit at that time by penn state long yardage situation penn state had loosened up their defense and were ready for a screen of some kind and it played it beautifully McIlroy comes onto the field with his kicking tee and puts it down at the 30 yard line so it'll be a 40yard field goal try by McElroy trying to make it a 10 nothing ballgame he's 1 for 1 at this distance longest this year was a 41yard oh by drone blegh six to go third quarter and it's still a seven nothing ballgame an assortment of signs hanging from the rafters here at the Superdome one of the more artistic ones there and here's Penn State for the ball first down the football is at the 23 yard line you have to go going deep he's got good ski going down complete depending on the play Allen firmly and Fusina not really able to get enough owner I think Pitts keen might have been able to outrun Crumley on that play but the boss kind of hung up in the air and mighty Lions in the meantime laid the Penn State quarterback home on the road Penn State is going into two tight ends on this particular play they have time to throw the ball and you see that disc is in behind from the right here and the ball had been thrown properly would have been a touchdown but it was underthrown from there was able to collision to receive us and the time the ball got there incomplete second down runs it up across 25 to right about the 30 they may put him at the 29 that'll bring up third down Penn State's got to go to the 33 they need just about four yards we have a tactical change in Penn State's offense they're using two tight ends in case you wonder how yo that's illegal procedure there whistling here well like Jim Brown moved in the line huh okay got to be get from the Penn State people are going to be getting a little frustrated on that offensive team they've lost their momentum they've lost their confidence and if this disturbs their fate then their silo said leaders when you have this much difficult that's amazing to me he held on to it but he's a very resourceful football flare and it's a first bound for the lines at that time Hugh Cena put something on that pillar he rifled it in let's watch it again you're gonna see a spectacular catch by number 81 Bob Bassett right on the boundary pushing off as if he's going to run DPS to turn back he juggled the ball he's going to get hit right there by crumbly number 17 but he keeps possession and clearly had little room is Corral and Romano were able to open the door forth and he's up close to the 40 don't carry a little bit it's the first time they've really had incomes yardage on first down which is destroyed their continuity their offense here's the screen setup and it goes to guman and goomahs got a penn state first down and a penalty flag on the field if the play stands it'll be good for a first down and stay moving back procedure ken that's a lack of concentration most of the time black the concentration Keith and then this stage of the game that I really feel that they are stunned a little bit because I haven't had any success and talking to their coaches at halftime it seemed that Alabama is disguising or hiding their defense and causing the problems backfield in motion second down and 11 for Penn State here the 34 you seen it will flow rose at short passes complete the pinky the tied in and herb is up to the 39 and then driven beckons well that's well short of the first down and down in the 40 at Sunday throw and have Randy Scott with blitzing and he got there they have three people coming it was fifty that made the contact and so Penn State will have to kick it away coaches understand if you don't have an option play running mostly power you can blitz almost any occasion and that on that occasion Penn State did not pick it up those are astounding statistics hangs it up Mike there watches if it goes out so Alabama will get the football okay 28 yard line on Saturday January 13 the Pro Bowlers tour and them will have for you the world Gymnastics Championships five Eastern and Pacific and the Americans of course I'm sure you are aware that our gymnastics group looking very well an international competition right now pointing toward the Olympic Games but you'll enjoy on ABC Saturday January 13 following the faux bowler school I Billy Jackson is in there and they fallback position along with Nathan and Jackson carries 196 pounds sophomore from Phoenix City got a yard it'll be second down and nine after 34 Alabama a better yarder than with 6:17 to go into third quarter Alabama 7:00 Rutledge outside Oh penalty flag is down as Joe Lally came across to make the defensive play from his defensive in position let's raise the flag here that's false ooh a defensive captain number 65 talking to the referee bill Jennings so obviously the penalty call is against Alabama and he's giving him the option of it because there was a loss on that play I am motion on the red Club decline the indents interesting call here keep this throw there put the ball in the air I'll try to run a safe play like a draw on option the way UMP has been hunting he's becoming bigger weapon all the time in interceptions this year his second is what defensive coaches say is this a tional play because the park is open momentarily but while the ball is in the air watch hares come right in front look at the ground he covers while the ball is in the air that's why you intercepted ten passes this year to lead the nation here's another out of it it's out Patton Clark number 80 he's open momentarily sensational play right in his hands Bob Torre a pullback carries the ball right up the middle it was first down Penn State at the Alabama 48 yard line five yards goal at second down and Donovan is wide to the left side and he is really quickly I don't know who put the defensive plan together for Alabama but whoever did it borders on pure genius I agree with you I talked to their defensive coaches Keith they said they took the last game that pitch plate plate shorted it and went back each play until the peach game until the first game and by then they knew exactly what they wanted cause it does help to have people like Marty Lyons from a 93 just an allamerican 112 tackle core defensive line in that sensation ball is up for 44 third down and six in big plays for Penn State makes the world inside the 20 or 24 yards real breath of the ballgame by the line formation and guman was lined up that the Goodman's lined up at the wing back he's wide open because the defensive end was no one there to make the play uncle McNeil Donna 28 and Harris finally get to Goodman just inside the 20th first down line they'll give it to about the 17 better part of three second down in seven coming up interception passed by Harris setting up this golden opportunity by Penn State learns a little bit around the deal with one of those things that coaches love to talk about is that old bottom line thing called character on the 17th you've seen it occur for the edge of the point to tie the game here's Mitch he was lined up wide receiver so that he'd have the speed to get into the middle on a twoweek deep it was a sensational get watch the foot come down right they said a tional play by Scott risky but also a great co D pop you Cena and lay it up and let it drop down in the open airy amazing all of the field left foot hits inside from the top man right down to the bottom man it is faces right down the line everybody pushes for quality Willie Rawls utility man this is who we are and what we do at General Motors my job is to replace any absent ease oh yeah they're all over the plane yeah you know you're not tied down to one job all the time you around different jobs no finishing well soldering but suddenly I think I enjoy soldering one in a young age I like that because there's a lot of skill in that fellas keep something going all the time then it's never dull around there y'all get along very good yeah you is you is good yeah the people on the line they have a while interesting the car go out the back horseback you looking for Jill's car because I'm right at great data plate now see how they're built you know see the closet that goes into them General Motors people building transportation to serve people drive over the into the end first down at the 20 and here's a different angle look at the touchdown you see us dropping back looking outside but this had land up it tied in his looking to the left through the safety man Harris OVA he was called out of position but watch this sensational catch his left foot comes in the end zone legal touchdown in college one foot in all that requires that point is welldocumented last without the recipe as Alabama running from the 20 yard line Whitman carrying and here's him one more look at a spectacular touchdown play by the line Jim Joe Paterno rented with a strategy of lining up biscuit tidy and where he gets a little bit lost going down the middle is you cannot see a safe the men we're ready to go praise the same two men he was fooled on the play as you can see right there Ricky Tucker the starting say black new engine looked to me like because he was lined up and tried in a linebacker happy assignment a cover and suddenly here if I say the Lord will decide from seniors doofus tackles look at the ice it's inside comes back up the field squares up the shoulders and makes the play on run great piece of camera work on director ng Sedaris guys have worked with us all through the season always back up and number 16 or as he fouled up as the penalty gave but I believe that Alabama was not legally set one second but in any event villain shows what we talked about he can get pranked up dude it is now up to Alabama having committed a mistake there and illegal motion to regain their poise absolutely they've become a little bit rattled here that touchdown shook them up they had everything going their way running time for um pray with soui and groove indeed there's the time remaining third quarter a lot of time left 7 7 ballgame one Penn State number two Alabama the 45th Sugar Bowl game another beauty Oh is he holiday party suey it backs up after 30 thirtytwo there is a 51yard foot same time five seconds this Saturday ABC's Wide World of Sports will feature the hula bowl from Honolulu for Eastern three central and one Pacific with it from men's collection athletes from across the country so many schools represented and everywhere you look on the roster absolute quality look the more and Bob Torre are the setbacks now behind check you Cena rolls out gets in the clear and then mrs. Fitz key on that role play now this frankly is the play that I'm surprised we haven't seen more of because it is on that side of the defensive alignment where Alabama has been hurt by injuries with EJ jr. John Moore oh and the Ricky Tucker all would be claimed that's the first time Keith they put two receivers to that side as you mentioned and had one of them open my clements number 43 has had the move in there and worked there so I am sure that you seen identify and Bob Tory just disappears underneath niggle Curtis McGriff Curtis is 257 pounds on the final little town of Cottonwood Alabama deep Alabama defense has been sensational this all game all the game more than seven yards to keep possession of the ball Morse code at seven you see though it is that kind of a play where your quarterback can really get clobbered but leg didn't really get a solid hit that's the fourth sack and Alabama's defense now is male defense State quarterback 460 yards of losses bad leg number 19 coming from the right side of your screen on safety blitz unblocked and let's get it back his block right here peg back inside picking up walkins Alabama Richards makes another ban missing finally Bradley Adama heat number 63 brings him down 62 yard return of the punt Byron Bragg's that big tackle was downfield and really made a big block so LULAC nerve excavator big way balls of that was Rutledge changing the play at the line bunch got little anxious number 63 I don't blame and that takes you right out of your game plan first in ten first and 15 is a big difference postal goal line Tony Nathan getting definition of the penalty from the referee bill Jennings and the ball is back at the 16 yard line first down and 15 let's peeping right into a stack at the 15yard line kind of an interesting little piece of side action going over there on the sidelines where Neal the Thai Dan have come down Gilson on the defensive back and it could well be that if Jeff had gone that way to add some room market back outside the 15 under 60 right he's inside the 10 about the nine running behind solid blocking his major Ogilvie and Steve Whitman a couple of cutdown blocks for it I'm winding down now of less than a minute to play in the third quarter that was a good call right there keep that had no luck with a wishbone where they get in penetration that you turn to fix the ball get outside of those crashing linemen and make the big play all is very near the eight yard line third down and seven I think it's fair to say Alabama's poise has been restored keep it at six to two yard punt return by Lu Eichner and here's Allen McElroy for the X to the board try go in the third quarter and Alabama regains the lead 14 to 7 here's the touchdown watch the little left is created City nearly comes close to tackling Rutledge before he gets started but the key block is made by Neal number eight down the field wipe here he'll save in the coming the calling his screen right up here make the block and keep Gilson back in the secondary alive Oh give it to go in for the touchdown or he is a hard running sophomore he is determined to get into that end zone one so McIlroy will now kick it off in fence State Wilson Donovan in the center as the deepest in man Joel cold a freshman out of Pittsburgh who's very Swift is also back there along with Matsui the short man is pull back I don't think he'll come no he fenced a first down at the 20yard line as Whistlestop the players on the field and the Penn State offensive unit comes in 21 seconds remaining there's the Alabama scoring drive and again let's remember that this touchdown was set up by Lou Weichmann marvelous return and he made the long run simply because his path was so well worked he had a beautiful wall to get over and get to and then when he got there he made two beautiful cuts to take a deeper end of the court to go alive that's Troy and what Massena as ej Junior he's not going to play a whole lot I don't think because he's really banged up bears so going forward but he made that play alright and time winding down after three quarters of play in the Sugar Bowl Alabama 1410 state seven paying your monthly bills can be a monthly has this game it is now Alabama that is the happy side as Penn State is looking at second down and 11 from their 19 yard line on the first play of the final four leading by score and Byron brags of they're too greedy let's go back to that beautiful blocked run by Lu Eichner a 62yard front returned have set up the go ahead touchdown over time when you get over to the boundary and picked up your block those that was rags number 47 50 is Scott good fine linebacker he cuts back inside you get the defense trying to cut you off and when you cut back you have a chance to get free finally the tackle is broke made by Bradley on 3rd and 11th you seen it will grow half hold offensive in does doesn't feel king right now sack is all the way back to near the 10yard line and with fourteen minutes to play in the football game Alabama is going to get the ball back and they're going to get very good field position out of it like Neriah standing beep to receive the punt from Scott Witzke makes it at the 47 36yard punt by fitzy and that's just right on his average not here are the third quarter numbers of course we can see that Alabama is where head offensive delayed 245 yards total 295 repents made an amazing thing you've 162 yards rushing they've had excellent field position most of the football game two turnovers apiece eight yards rushing 95 yards in three quarters total owned by the referee in the Alabama back fear that almost always means one of two things motion procedure or offensive moving Penn State it has their backs to the wall right they must stop up he's going I would expect him to get in the blitzes blissing defense is something to try to give Alabama a bad play and get the ball back they're going to walk off fire from the 43 back to near the 48 49 let's see right in between early stage there this time it'll be first down and 15 68 yards have been lost now on five sacks by the Penn State quarterback five yard line ken Donahue is the man who normally would have the chore of putting the defensive game plan together I'm sure that he led the thinking and planning on it but I would also think that everybody anticipated it it is what it is marvelously conceived by the Alabama staff kept Penn State offbalance and Power Ball get Nathan closing in on 100 yards now at 12 I think Jim bunch might have moved on the right side see Matt Millen number 60 and there his armor Jeff Rutledge his neck but won't it get a jump old Clark he was he was blocking Clark man from an old pass protection it looked like people wanted to get him before Clark got started and he jumped the counter little early all there's madness you wonder why bears not wearing his hat well he's in dopers and his mother told him never to wear his hat in the house a little procedure 63 on a red so I was bunch who did move gets the illegal procedure flag the ball is now backed up to the 50yard line it is second down and seventeen and the ball is handed in the middle to Villa Jimmy bangs off the stack goes down about the 49 yard line that stack was led by Lance male linebacker here comes a play in from the sideline with a fullback Whitman coming in and Jackson comes out nearly lost his shoe that's probably why I was coming out Keith Q is out as well and both in his in at a wide receiver spot now on third down and about 16 those instead fairyland short of the first down and over there to make the play is number 28 rich millat who's already made one big big defensive play for Penn State though the Lions were unable to convert it into any points Alabama's in the I formation to fake gulf tackle the tight end goes down and out the linebacker the lot the strong safety 28 has him and for man he's a little bit behind in completion but not enough for first and right here the 40 yard line now I'm pretty punt you've gotten two men peoples it up there gets it out of Bounce you didn't get much on it really way up here they'll mark it for you and we'll be right back for 12 21 to play in the game Chevy trucks massive girder beam suspension system built tough to ride allowing wheels to step up and down independently over bumps and ruts to help smooth the ride chevy trucks suspension don't need me anymore well we've got some games that do make the best of your recreation time with AMF we make Roadmaster bicycles and mopeds sunfish sailboats tennis racket skis in sports where we make weekend weekend's were made for comebacks for the 18th consecutive year it's the best and professional bowling premiering January 6 on ABC the Pro Bowlers tour in the Cotton Bowl Houston has run off to a 15point lead over Notre Dame in the third quarter Davis making it 27 12 on a two in state there look like Don McNeil got a hold of it number 28 and she was getting up there you sewer he is 211 pounds and he's a tough dive or he runs hard and he just stopped that time as the static snaps again pinch day only five yards rushing free clinic caught us roll over second down the 42 the 41 were rich Wingo and rich is a wellknown linebacker for Alabama but he got kneed in the back and he's had spasms and nerve troubles with it for the half a season he's in their right hand Barry frost comes out and no Mandy Scott comes out and Barry cross goes in at linebacker now brows is the emotional leader feet paws up the defense 41 yard line first down line in the middle of the Alabama defense says he comes up near the 46 yard line best way to help pass protection Keith it's establish the running game and that's what Penn State seems to be doing right here running up the middle as much as possible on the swirl that ruff Lions came in with a 19game winning have been many memorable winning streaks stopped in postseason play one of the longer ones Oklahoma's 31 game streak by Kentucky in the Sugar Bowl of 1951 people should play by EJ junior number 39 Wow he's on his money and he reached up knocked him down more that was a great play by junior but lor should have seen that he had the ball deep in the backfield and she cut away from it go back up inside he chose go outside and junior made a sensational play let's watch it again number 32 on the widest green suid throwing the block on junior has in block but more gold tricycle outside when he had some sole daylight inside it's third down at eight he's beyond the marker for a first down so the Lions stay alive with a first down at the Alabama 47 yard line that was the same Paspalum they're doing over on the corner to set up their touchdown fake right there Goodman goes right in behind the trailing spit in he's open momentarily you've seen his right all talking Jim Bob Harris making the tackle if he had overrun him just a little bit he'd had quite a bit of room down that sideline the pass is cut by Brad Scoville number 80 grants gobo who made a couple of big plays in Penn State's victory over to Ohio State early in the season deep I've been wondering when they were going to their tight ends firing the linebackers rushing them the tight end is usually open in the middle that time he was for a pick play they all move right now 29yard line of Alabama first down Penn State the defensive end had put himself in exactly the right place and he was just waiting he accepted hooker more with DJ gingers had a full hamstring had been able to practice the two or three days mystery in hidden played too much in his ballgame before in two sensational play warned lousy Alabama no starter started also has a little hamstring trouble incomplete and here it is again you can see fasted going on the block pattern but I hope the camera will show how wide open Michie is now in the middle but here is my deal number 28 and Harris the safety pull over old the play first Harris has his hands on it but did my deal comes down put that is the third interception of Chuck view Cena in the ballgame 9 18 to play in the ballgame in Alabama leading 14 to 7 they have the ball first down at the 20 I can tell by the happy butcherin by that ever they said it comes it takes a lot to make an investor happy today but a dean witter with our investment services our research and above all our people we think we can make you happy too the Alabama bench now as McNeal sits on there with his defensive teammates exulting and a moment of grip Flay and its first man Bama at the 20 those are they're coming out to the right leaving Alabama in our formation and give the ball to Akane and make them play on the views out of wide receiver Bolton comes in down yards of the game reflected there

Goodwrench Penn State's Chuck Fusina UCLA is the oldest prom Charles Alexander of LSU postseason action on the hoola ball Saturday on ABC I'm becoming a big factor in this ball game a lot of NATO but Chuck casino third and five once again on this play is a formation Hopkins tripleoption watch grunting City pizza bowl existed before he got to the defensive in and both Lally is right there eighty bull sir number 65 recover big boy rushed down at the LMF 19 yard line Matsui runs it up inside that 10 to the 8 yard line what up turnaround in the ball game alabama lady 14 to 7 turned the ball over to penn state and sewer on the first play over the right side behind inside the pen and looks like he's got a person go get the block is a looks at play right there doubleteam into those man so he had a nicely he questioned go to go from the six yard line as the Alabama defense was moving quickly to the play and Marty Lyons 93 in Ricky Gilliland 92 to replace him number 36 rich window I'm there what I turn over and that was Alabama's had only one first down in this half very very well the outfit started to come alive second down six and I want to tell you something folks there was one whale of a defensive play by Alabama's Don McNeil because bitch he has momentum and McNeil just won't let him come in number 46 bitch is playing drive out watch Neal who has planned the deep man come up and make the plate he's not even covering this deep of a 28 makes a sensational play to prevent the touchdown so it is third and goal to go at the oneyard line every male jennings doesn't even wait a few Sina to step away he can hear the crowd and he just dumps it right there because he's entitled to that his team hear him call the count six five seven to go in the ballgame and Penn State trying to tie the score right here we get down Frank into the late moments the Penn State has any kind of field position at all that bar becomes such an important vector and then they just kick it guide up right here Julian building deliberate about the circumstances they may not have another opportunity quite like this six minutes and 44 seconds to play in this big big big ballgame a good quarterback does its homework on and off the field that's probably one of the three of us are all drinking lot beer from milk he lights got 1/3 less calories than the regular beer and it's less filling plus it tastes great and you know it's important to have a command of facts like that it's mental discipline really you're darn right cuz if you know every position every option and every formation you'll never get your signals crossed that's my beer turn everything you always wanted in a beer unless you sure are getting behind Chevy's new midsized Malibu American and why not it's got the right mileage estimates the right size the right field the right look and the right room and for a lot of folks it's got the right name Chevy Malibu the 79 Chevy Malibu could be just right for you the yard in the Sugar Bowl a half a yard to go for the touchdown and the possibility of tying or going ahead before Penn State 19 game win streak only undefeated team in the country to everything to be hanging on it looks like it might be married Krauss I think he just kind of got caught in the crush underneath who came over the cot to freeze the lunge Mike was trying to go over the top window and Kraus and Hamilton and Lyons all sort of stood up and they stopped in short so it is very Kraus we've taken him down on the field right now deep Paterno went the iformation on that last call took the ball deep in the backfield as you said to allow human to jump but what happens on the goal line deep it's alive in a carefree across the goalline sensational plan may be prevented men's day from winning the national championship cross ran off he went headon with cumin and took a solid shot but he got the job done that's what he'll remembers the years go by before the running back Tony Nathan is brought down and they're very cross now who's collecting his wits after that a little key that although that I can remember boy dramatic situation he had two downs to make a foot the national championship six misstatements trying to pin Alabama beep down here so that they can force the Bama to punt and get the ball in good field position as we go inside six minutes to play didn't you show the film to half of our policy to throwing a pass right here the same the same situation hitting the key pass and winning the ball game with ordainment upsetting down get the first down so the Penn State defense does the job and Alabama will have to punt it from the endzone and the Lions shouldn't be any worse than midfield they'll 20th time clock running at 5:20 to go in the game Penn State defense stopped them again as they have most of this football game offense has not made in a yardage has not been able to make any consistent drives they've been playing most of the ballgame pumpers had a pretty good day punting had one bad one for nine yards way back upfield by the back door would you believe there 12 men on the field who buy Penn State that is 15 yards if that is what I think it is they were counting 92 did not know whether he was to get off the field Ahmad he's showing his hand so he's the walk the law of averages finally catches up I guess I don't know what it is they call it what you want indecision confusion but it will give Alabama a first down 15yard penalty when you play with 12 men if one is trying to get off the field it's only a fiveyard penalty that state would have had the ball in Alabama territory but they really let's see if the defense to come back and stop them one more time they still got time if they can make the dangle up it's three kinds of fun marking off the penalty which brings the ball we appeal all the way up to the 22 yard line where's spoon as toothpick breaks in the kicking game one on the punt return by Eichner that set up the forehead touchdown and as we said early breaks in the kicking game stun your football team it gives them the spirit it makes us this therapy while we're waiting for the punt let's pause five seconds to allow our local stations to identify themselves in Birmingham this is TV six shouldn't say if we're going to punt they're going to run the ball just run it and run it and run Alabama turns it over Penn State gets it a half a yard away from the goal line two plays to take it in can't do it then Alabama's punting penn state figures to get the ball no worse than midfield penn state gets caught with 12 men on the field 15yard penalty gives alabama the first down the score is 14 to 7 and the clock is running at 4 to half minutes to play in the game Alabama bag progresses up the field this great huge Wars with this record crowd of more than 76,000 what made you whole if it made a he cuddle net play he was going outside he saw a little daylight and when he turns up field deep he looked like a truck going down seventy six thousand eight hundred and twenty four which is a new super doll record first down Alabama as the ball is advanced to the 34yard solid docking to turn that corner and Pete Harris the safety made to stop for Penn State instinct could not have played to play in a better but they set up his broth bacon inside vital Nathan now 18 carries running for the MVP exactly four minutes to play in the game four minutes it is second down at the 39 yard line and five to go penalty flag that may be a flag against the time procedure Alabama and look at the bear growl oh my goodness Alabama tried to run with a quick count and all 11 players were not set for one second he sends that left back in the ball game while this move back five yards to the 34 where second down and ten kuben defensive in Larry kuben got him next Chuck that's all he can do right now is hope you see the time winding away definitely the friend of Alabama watch Rutledge on this particular play lag hoobin number set pitch it because last time he it was a bumble and also on the left was right in the line of fire whistle and it stopped again it's a procedure call against Alabama that's the second one in this possession Ravin it's in 20 seconds to play in the football game bill Jennings takes the ball back to the 29 it is now and 15 Alabama's been hit with 10 flags for 70 yards just run some safe play maybe giving the ball to Nathan and has a chance to pop it in the big way then cut it and see what Penn State to do with it about the 34 pullback Whitley they send all the punting team and I'll bet you one thing they count all the white shirts just done well they got a big decision when they will look like they're moving back for the return sue and cumin are the beat men no pressure woman across the field and very alertly Randy Scott I believe it was it come down to protect that side of the field woody upgrade with a beautiful 45yard high hanging kick his ninth of the ballgame and Penn State is back at the 21 ticking has been a key factor for Alabama's field position which mate has made Penn State play a more conservative offense and most of the ball game 2:42 to play in the game Penn State does have the ball and still were the opportunity I'll see what they can do it at Lake Boston fiveyard not judge throws his flag and when he does that hit little buzzer goes off on that timer and it's too much time five yards against Penn State oh hi Joe Fields very frustrating afternoon things have not gone right for him 2:42 its first round number 16 yard line you say no look on the sidelines rock is frozen at 2:36 once again you see no zip the ball biscuit number 46 pushes as if he's going deep turns right back to the sideline the ball is right on target has few seen even if you've seen it rifle that ball right there 92 gentlemen come Gilliam comes in makes the place Chuck is head umber much better second half nine out of 14 for a hundred and eight yard the 32 you seen it up put it up again throws it short this time to Mike doubled up by EJ jr. and Wayne Hamilton the defensive ends who had peeled off to cover that short zone gain is up to about the 37 and there's the time the National Championship riding right here if Penn State could pull it out almost surely they would get it it would be the first one ever for Penn State if Alabama wins its football game suddenly USC complete fairy Crouch linebacker but drop back and he slept it away there was sensational effort by Kraus what's the scene he's trying to throw back over the middle and Kraus gets a good break on the ball watch how far he can go number seven is 7 right in front of the receiver and gets his hand up knocks it incomplete the ball is still sitting near the 37 yard line where it is third down to play could be it's a screen the good he's going to be short of the first down they've got to go with 152 Flay they will have to go on for up and short Keith they gave him a pretty good spotted look yeah they did didn't it there's an Alabama man down on the field they advanced it a little farther than I thought perhaps they might on that play it may be a first down and it's Don McNeil who has made two big plays in this football game including an interception in the end zone he's demand down on the field for Alabama Bryant looking out terribly concerned because he's had to go in this ball game without his regular free safety Ricky Tucker that were further week than this secondary puts more inexperience back there it is a first down for a Penn State so they gave him a good spot on the ball as guman is a big lanky fellow and very strong and at the point of impact he apparently just lunged ahead through the crowd and he got just enough for the first down McNeal coming off the field rather gingerly for the passing likely seen it you always have a tent we've seen it this year Southern Cal Notre Dame what can happen when you have a pass all right let's check the Alabama secondary that's where the pressure points are going to be Murray leg Jim Bob Harris Allen from me and you know that the two linebackers Kraus and Wayne Gore going to be dropping to protect the shorter zones it would be that we'll see that same play with Fitz be lining up that's how they got their touchdown 150 to play at the ballgame in state to have any hope close to the sideline thirtyeight to play stakes in a hurry that gained 14 yards that's all there's left one in 38 110 state clearly number two Alabama law school 14:07 dinner rolls and rolls the pass is caught by Brad Scoville tumbles out of bound saves time at the Alabama 41 wonder if Alabama will change their defenses trousers they have defended with three men rushing on each of these plays will they change up and put the big rush so that they had so much success with all throughout this ball game well they're there they're playing center field now the tide will take time as fast called it and we'll go talk to his coach and I'm sure that that's what they're going to talk about is how to play their defense Alabama with one timeout remaining in the game one minute 32 seconds those are the numbers on chap Fusina in the ball game in this half he's 13 out of 19 for 135 yards it's second down and seven thirty to play now as he dumped it 1:28 to play in the game Marty Lyons and Byron Bragg's were hunting and great they were absolutely fair call timeout says hey man quit going after him and they did the Fusina had to get rid of all to repent a big loss in this kind of a defensive play though they do stretch out the so called short zone area because the neat people are playing way back most people that's watching that this one's gonna save you if I fix dinner there the 19th leg right there it is fourth down penn state seven yards to go 122 to play in the game Alabama leads 14 to 7 beef a swimmer legged hallways johnnyonthespot 116 to play time outs Penn State to making choices to win they're going to call the timeout for seven yards and now in Penn State's last offensive play of the season that's it number 81 going curling back to the inside let's see leg number 19 the break on the ball my leg is just sensation he was behind him so when the ball got to the receiver he was in front you can break it up jagged allamerican boys matter there not so much the receiver trying to catch it but prevent flag from intercepting and running it back up beat we'll handle own commercial in state benefited from the growth men on the bill but here in this memorable sugar bowl game beginning to settle in a little bit now on the penn state side of the field 102 to play in the ball game alabama just trying to sit on it they've got a second down and two just short of midfield so there will be a yard short of first down and we're inside a minute to play and the Memorial Trophy awarded to the outstanding player the MVP award in effect has been chosen very Kraus of Alabama made the sensational tackle fourth down and a foot as Gilman tried to bleep go airborne for the touchdown he hit him head up with his helmet pried open and pushed it back he's played sensational all day long reticular rushing the passer the yard for the first down first down it'll be four up in one Penn State with no more timeouts remaining now's the time they'll have to go for the block I would think if Alabama's going to punt the ball the only chance would be to block it and pick it up they store with block his running 40 seconds to play they'll take a fiveyard penalty here father anybody to my fly so crushers all you tell your kid to here is jet you watch it in and mix with us face the footwork as you possibly can year ago in the Cotton Bowl Notre Dame came from positions in the regular season oh there's your flag that'll stop the clock of 19 seconds today one Texas season we'll figure it Roma's playing the rest scooters back to what he um pray they make the run up the block it's a poor kick with 12 seconds to play so Penn State's going to get at least one playoff 82 merit Krauss's first lineman to get the MVP award at the Sugar Bowl since 1956 I think that Penn State has been averaging close to 400 yards in offense and could not move the ball against an Alabama team the some of the opponents this year it had much success you give the defensive coaches and staff tremendous credit while designing that defense way back before the first game was played in the preseason poll major polls at Alabama pick close if not there that is the interception there are people all over the field take a while either run off the clock and forget it the stands and out onto the field necessarily get the national championship because you finish the season undefeated to a Paterno's the net for time for me to get it 1966 in the 767 fold for example of Nebraska 34 to 7 in the Superbowl game finished the year 1100 but and we lost the master championship Alabama beat Nebraska one year after me if they need the season 10 states 19 game win streak longest among the division 1a teams about to come to it in and once again penn state is denial is played by some kid i would say they played like national offense big defense boys they got a tough break when Vince made tied the game up but they came right back with a outstanding comfort her and went in and scored and they have been able great deep bench the rest of the game defense at Alabama has shown us today frankly just then sensational fill all of the defensive note said they could not cover man's fate in a soul they can all have to rush and put a lot of pressure perfection Joe is gonna be turned to salad one more time as he hunts elusive number one does your last well this news will reign with clarity through at least two locker rooms themes on the west coast and of course Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl I don't mean to suggest in that that Michigan would be in a position to do some arguing about a national championship and they handle the Trojan seven gal in the Rose 1a in 1978 in 1977 when it was all done only Texas went into a postseason bowl game beat them men snake comes in undefeated Alabama meets them we will have the

  "transcript": "let me look at this and snake the lemon wins and no losses first if all the major polls the only division 1a team to go undefeated Alabama lost one time to USC in Birmingham since that time they've over the wall this is a dream matchup only the fifth time that one and two and the polls of that on the field the pass history of this kind of matchup reflected there the Rose Bowl the console the Rose and the last time it happened was the 1972 Orange Bowl the band people the flavor the MBR Paulette what you want let's call it for the sake of one word spirit you'll never find a group of people for intensely interested than a group of who are gathered here in the Superdome because so many of them come from so far away to see their favorite bean play the first time that Penn State really is a mad at is to go on the field and win their first national championship hello everybody I'm Keith Jackson and talking about this national championship let's define it this way if the undefeated Nittany Lions win this ballgame today it seems a virtual certainty as they will be afforded the muster as national champion if Alabama should win today it would appear that we'll have to wait until all the voting is done in the polls and they are published because if Alabama wins today you know that USC for one has a rightful claim for some degree of recognition in that area you also know that Oklahoma if they should defeat Nebraska will be in a position to claims of firstplace votes as well so that's pretty much the simplest definition we can give you but I will tell you this that when we had the preseason polls before the first game is played Alabama was picked to be number one and Penn State was picked to be number three but that was a long time ago now we're going to settle the issue off the field of play and let's begin as Jim Lampley talks with the two quarterbacks the conversation recorded earlier Chuck Lucina and Jeff Rutledge Chuck from a competitive standpoint this is obviously the most important game Penn State has played as a team in some time as you look at it personally how do you judge the importance of this game for you well without saying it probably is the most important game in Penn State history um being because we have the chance to win the national championship on the field there have been other big games in Penn State as in 72 and 69 they've had big orange four wins but then again after the wins that we didn't get a number one ranking we fill Penn State that if we can win this game there should be no question that we could be number one so therefore I think we're not only going to be playing for ourselves but for those teams that just got edged out and for all other teams of Penn State who never got the chance to play for a national championship so you're playing for the identity of Penn State as a football program in all the years under Paterno and not just to prove that this team is the best in the country right now I think in a way we are you know we want to win this national championship for our team that's that's our first priority but all those other teams that we felt at Penn State were a little slighted or you know we I think they'll be celebrating this one as much as we will Jeff it's an understatement to say that this is an important game but what was the goal of a national championship and the fact that a national championship make hinge on the outcome of this game mean to you individually well that was the main reason I came in University of Alabama to begin with was the chance to play for a national championship it is my fourth year in my senior year and it's finally here the planned Penn State is certainly a an honor and a privilege to you know they've ranked number one in the nation and that's what footballs all about to reach the highest possible go you can reach and the other winner of this game will probably be the national champion that's what it's all about that's the reason I came to the University Alabama's hopefully the game's over you know I can say I played on the national championship football team the quarterbacks Chuck Fusina and Jeff Rutledge both very good passers both imaginative quarterbacks and they have plenty of people that fall on offensively first let's have a look at the ground truth that Penn State will be showing you today number 48 running at tailback is fuller more he's a sophomore 207 pounder he was second on the team in rushing this year with 602 yards for six touchdowns 416 passes and maybe the fastest of the Penn State backs sharing the tailback work with him is Mike cumin number 24 he's a junior 210 pounder one of the more versatile athletes on the field he started last year for Penn State as a defensive back this year moved back over the tailback where he ran to 351 yards the fullback number 32 Matsui and he is the tough runner ran for seven hundred and twenty yards he's also a good receiver with 26 catches he scored seven touchdowns this year and he's a little quicker than the first glance who might reveal he does have four or five speed moving to the wide receiver position you have an outstanding athlete number 46 scotf it's key he holds the school career record for touchdown catches with 11 he is also the team hunter with a 36 yard average and he is very dangerous when he goes deep now there is another young man who wears the number 10 who has to figure heavily in everybody's class look at 18 out of 19 within 40 yards in the fieldgoal olds virtually all of the kicking records Alabama good ground troops there too for example let's look at the left half back out of the wishbone they call him touchdown Tony Nathan he's homegrown right in Birmingham he is just three yards chart of his 2000 mark for his career and he has played a lot through all four years of his career very steady football player with enormous ability and he can break the long run almost anywhere at any time at fullback starting his Steve Whitman he's a big solid fellow at 235 pounds and a very good blocker but he's finally playing on healthy legs for the first time in a long time and he is double trouble pounding up the middle there is a youngster on the right side of the wishbone number 42 a sophomore major Ogilvie he has delivered so many big plays for Alabama this season 186 Founder but he runs harder than that he's a very difficult fellow to bring down wide receiver number for Keith few one of the most acrobatic people I've ever seen at this position he had 20 catches this season and he will share the work at wide receiver today with senior Bruce Bolton those are some of the offensive people right now the Nittany Lions of Penn State now either it's the Superdome their coach Joe Paterno can you can see the way they had some other tough moments but toward the end of the season they were very solid eating good football team lost one time the USC at the third game of the season 24:14 blonde Hall the rest of them had some close calls but the bear raised his young people for their own SAT for the willingness to ignore circumstances it made life difficult for them and they just kept on winning and here they are with a chance they feel to win a national championship working with us as analyst and commentator today mr. Frank Broyles and frankly puffles considerably now about the offense but you and I both know that Joe Paterno and Bear Bryant build their football games on be better well Penn State is the best defensive football team in the country reason is deep they play hard and aggressive against the one in the back they probably shut it down completely and when they do watch out here comes a big rush to demoralize it most offensive units but I should point out that this is the first time in three years that Penn State has faced the wishbone attack we have three allamerican defensive tackles out on the field today two of them we're together in the Penn State line Matt Millen and Bruce Clark you know Bob native of Tennessee he used to say that the law is on the side of the team that a to DES tackle and these two at Penn State are outstanding they could disrupt any offensive running attack and in put extreme pressure on the past Alabama offers you Marty lions and some ferocious wine better yet lloyd lines leads the team strains enough as a down linemen in tackles at 112 and Barry Kraus is also in allamerica and he's big and strong and tough and knows how to play against the world what then can we expect in the way of offensive tactics well Alabama fields that they must use a variety of formations to play against his strong Penn State defense they feel like if they can shift and use man in motion they can keep the defense offbalance and then Keith they have a chance to set up the key play in the wishbone attack that's the fullback handle if they don't do this they cannot have a kick they won't have a chance to run Y all throw much one of the things that we have here other than the fact that we have two very good football teams about to play each other ranked one two we have two great coaches across the field from each other very definitely Keith Joe Paterno has run a great football coaches this nation is people admire respected his players love him and he's a one on every respect and bam Bryant and the coach's opinion on AG everybody is the greatest motivator of people the games ever seen year after year he if he can come up with a great football team these teams never Steve complacency they when the best is needed that's enough conversation let's play the game we'll have the kickoff for you right after this Giuseppe Harris as he reached the 20yard line here is the offensive back field for the Crimson Tide of Alabama these pictures were taken at the court of two sisters the quarterback is the senior Jeff Rutledge Pony Nathan opens at halfback major Ogilvie is the other halfback and Steve Whitman is the fullback and they're all from Birmingham and Bruce Bolton will open at wide receiver he's a senior from Memphis Whitman in motion the pitch 20 they bring him down up around the 24 the offensive front the big guys for Alabama's offense they break down this way buddy at Alette number 78 is a tackle Mike Rock 235 why Stephenson one of the centers in the country invents booth Jim bunch out of Mechanicsville Virginia and a Rick Neal is the tight end it is second down for the 47 we have a big eight officiating crew here working this ballgame the defensive setup for Penn State those are the officials bill Jennings the chief the referee Clips choirs Frank Ellis John the clinic Dan ups in an edge Shannon and we have Tony Nathan shaken up on the play he's coming slowly off the field dragging a leg so on his second carry in the ballgame Nathan he takes a whack and Lou white there number 30 will go into tailback to replace him Tony coming off under his own power but he appears to be hurting considerably but we will watch that development Jim Lampley is with us on the sidelines and we will have the information from the 27 it is third down and three Rutledge gives inside they whisper back banging away trying to reach the 30 and it appears that he may well have gotten his first down the Penn State defensive people up front it's Larry Cuban Bruce Clark pointed Petruchio meant the linebackers defense they close to a lance fail and rich Murat and the defensive secondary Michaelson Karl McCoy and Pete Harris V Paris top interceptor in the country had a great season the ball of just beyond the 30 where it is first down now for Alabama and Frank Broyles they were able to get movement that coming up the middle from their fullback Tony Nathan is out of the lineup dragging his leg Whitman carries over the left side and Jeff Rutledge the Alabama quarterback took a pretty good look after he had handed the ball away the gain is 1 yard they're icing down the hip for Tony Nathan as you see there for real second they have a bruise he could have a hip corners whatever he's part Rosen down and roof it unloads it and there's the big guy we were talking about at the 31yard line as you see the big guy just roaring through and it's a virtual impossibility and we've got a little trouble with frank brawls microphone here right now but it's virtually impossible to block him one on one Bolton comes out of the lineup for Alabama a wide receiver now is Keith phew number four it is third down and nine from the 31 bashing down gets good protection they're unable to reach the firstdown marker at the 40yard line so good defensive flow by Penn State and now Alabama will come up for the first time that Rutledge got a good taste of what the pass rush that Penn State has had all year long it's devastating Mike cumin and naturally double deep where we saved the punt of woody Humphrey coming over calls fair catch I'm pretty knocks it out of bounds Nora kick back in bounds filled with a pair of yard line he was looking for the coffin corner he didn't get it but he got it deep enough that's the 12 here's Jim to tell us about Tony Nathan you take a look at Tony Nathan along the sidelines he's still being worked on by Alabama trainer Jim goose tree they say it's a bruise in the top part of the hip he doesn't seem to be hurt on the outside part of the hip in the hip pointer area they're putting ice on him they hope he'll be ready to go back in and play shortly but they're not certain how long it'll take Bear Bryant came over and took a look Thank You Jimmy first down from Penn State there the French state back fearless woman cuts it up to the 20yard line Keith Penn State came out an unbalanced line the first play of the ball game the crowd is upset Alabama's defense play were successful but holding by the offense we told you this is a neutral group of officials they're all from the big 8 conference the Penn State offensive backfield let's take a look at them while Alabama discusses the penalty call against the Nittany Lions Chuck Fusina is the quarterback hooker more will share tailback with Mike Newman Matsui the fullback and Bob Bassett flankers Scott fit ski the wide receiver will split in and the putter marching off half the distance putting the ball back very close to the six yard line where it will be first down at 15 for the Nittany Lion where he is grabbed and dragged down by Ricky Gilliland 92 defensive linebacker the Penn State offensive front her Venky is a tide in reverted from tackle Keith Dorney is the big guy up front Eric Cunningham Chuck Corral is the center for Penn State Jim Romano a very good sophomore guard Jim Brown a very good sophomore taco second down and about 13 of all those the Matsui the 15yard line comin across party lines and Queen Hamilton to make the tackle Hamilton had been hero are the end they're both weighing less than ol Marty Lyons and Byron Bragg's the tackles and the Warren Wilder freshman is the middle guard the linebackers of Eric Clapton Ricky Gilliland the defensive secondary for Alabama McNeill from Lee leg in Paris Jim Bob Harris is a freshman replacing Ricky Tucker his outfit into the casino Alabama's defensive flow here Penn State does retain possession he thought of passing down Alabama went to double coverage here's the roll out paved that one receiveth EEP one shot both covered casino had to turn up the field run the football ball was knocked loose but they did recover McGriff knocked it loose Govan recovered him and opened his back to receive the punt from Scott Witzke gets it away and major calls fair catch for Alabama up at the 44 yard line so the Princeton pride will have good field position for their second offensive possession of the ball game Tony nathan has been wrapped a little more and he's been jogging around now you see him running loosening up well back up the bench to see how the hip field it's in the hip area and as Jim Lampley told us approved not appointed you see Tony again before this ball game is done first down Alabama from the 44 yard line no school first quarter by Jove alley number 84 there was good pressure from the inside Frank and here comes the Penn State defensive end we saw these two fellows against Maryland have big fall game Lubin and well until the turn Oh Keith has always believed in forcing the office he overly downs he's gonna play aggressive and put all the pressure ken Lambie came flying across on the option play and collision of all care for Lawson outstanding play on his floor Tony nathan is back in the lineup for Alabama at left halfback out of the wishbone with Whitman the fullback and Ogilvy on the right side Queen over there with the ferry Penn State's into the field tremendous blocking by adalat and brach watch them 17 18 17 did this is a misdirect screen the key to it is the acting of blood lanes going all the way old the right throwing ferret Ainslie across the field but the defense had reacted as they would expect and weapon makes an outstanding run lowers his shoulder gets the extra yardage and his post go first and just a little bit short as the referee Phil Jennings will bring it back into the hash mark Tony Nathan back in the lineup having suffered a bruised hip but he ran on the field and this is the kind of a football game well you're not gonna let a little hurt stop you from playing it absolutely not you're gonna be out there if you possibly get double tied in a line but now with Neil and Tim Travis in there Nathan oftentimes is the money man in this call Rutley pitches it back he's inside the 40 to the 39 yard line the Alabama backfield the yardage total may not be that impressive per man but look at the average four carry the reason it's not depressed in total eyes deep is they have four running backs close the eye formation teams the tailback will carry the ball 30 35 pounds but then the wishbone if evened out across the backfield if they have success and they are good this is Alabama football team so often ear mistake Rutledge salvages it and Nathan gets the first down as the Penn State Jeff handles between this time turns it up inside and he'll do that he'll stick his head in there and especially if those big defensive linemen of Penn State are coming so hard by over running Keith it appears that the defensive strategy is bring millon and Clark through the gap this is what he did against Texas in the Cotton Bowl and a few years ago and they disrupt anything down the line of scrimmage if you don't double D them and those numbers you just saw tell you how stingy to pay for on the ground it is second down at about seven yards to go and major Ogilvie down to the 33 yard line where Bruce part makes the tackle hence fakes defense has 5min lined up to play the run on both sides of the football his Clark you can see the quickness and agility of this plan he was he was away from the play no one blocked him he goes right down the line and makes the tackle number 54 he was a linebacker as a freshman even started six game Josie's quickness third down and four for Alabama Penn State 33 let's go which would half the ball in his hands he had Rick Neil there to block for him he might very well have scored he looked the other way didn't let the ball into his hands and Alabama misses the first day was a golden opportunity to make a big flake even auspice thought it was a wonderful fake run late fool the defense and Neil was going across the field and was wide open he threw a little bit on behind him and Whitman which I favor the dropdown we've got the field goal try now for Alabama and doing the kicking will be Ellen McElroy he will hit it out of Kevin Jones hold it is a 51yard field goal that's the first time this season that McIlroy has tried if he'll go 50 yards or more he mystic 744 to go first water in no score no I hunt inside the Superdome 72 degrees outside it's about 50 degrees and raining and kind of damp and cold but all across the country there is some real tough weather Dallas for example chill factor of minus 10 snow ice just about everything you can walk that's uncomfortable over there today upper middle west we're told is being battered by a winter storm we feel very fortunate to be inside the dome for this 79 Sugar Bowl game Penn State gets the ball at the 33 the line of scrimmage since they missed the kick under the rules they get it back out where it was that from and Fusina goes over the middle east eighteen yard gain beep that was an outstanding trolled by Fusina he drops back fakes to the tailback to try to freeze the linebacker pass it over 81 breaking in front of the safe demands riedel target took hers back catches it and makes a big reception first down just over midfield for Penn State the first time they pass the ball in Alabama territory they own him right on the letters Alabama's linebackers stack in behind their defensive guards in tackles well offensive blockers cannot get to it and when you run straight ahead they are likely to hit you on many occasions just like those guards for Alabama now second down and nine back Alabama in fact you see no Christine an Alabama from before right off the carpet here comes Mary cross Frank putting a lot of heat on you see now Chuck my Amanda throw it before he wanted he ran right through it forced him to move just a little bit to the left and you seen it was all palace he would Bend fella head he's not throwing the ball it was way off target but look at the inception that leg makes right phase all Southeastern Conference issue at his first an Alabama the football is just outside the 33 yard line Rick Neal wired to the right Rutledge stands up and throws at it he tried the onehanded Karl McCoy defending for Penn State here again mayor says he's gonna have to throw playaction passes on early bound to try to keep Millard and Clark from Jeson went back and disrupted his hopping via was open key but he missed six minutes and 40 seconds and you can see that Penn State has been a relatively careful football team the 21 turnovers this season I don't make that mistake Boldin is wide to the right they sit on the left and he crushes the 42 the 43 quite Stevenson the Center for Alabama number 57 is our trail of a football player he's a big guy 63 230 pounds junior at a Hampton Virginia and he's about as good as you'll see at that position the Alabama coaches they could be the best clock in the history of their school and the impediment Cernan is an added bonus for this wishbone attack third down they need a little bit less than a yard and Rutledge writes to us fall back the Penn State 40 I told you at the very beginning that Steve is playing on to sound legs for genes and the 235 pounds and stone type II stuff let's look at it give this the first phase the triple option he's bridled his scene plan he can hit the line of scrimmage but he is a determine football player 235 pound gets in the secondary and makes a big play very key for them to have that success early the ball game inside that's the key to the wishbone 44 yards of Penn State frontage second and on the sidelines through the flag in state players say it's against Alabama the appointing package so that's a tough break for Alabama talking there to the defensive captain that is Paul Shuey the brother of Matsui our clip beam yarder coming up against the Crimson Tide that gets fair moving around a little because they seemingly had some momentum going to outstanding run by Ogilvy life from the hospital Macon in fact just cut through the his own effort made the play watch Stephenson number 57 he's one of outstanding blocker you can see comes him high over those Manning keeps his feet we call that blocking old maintaining position and not falling on your face Stephenson is a great one a 49yard line now for its first down and 15 the left side of that Penn State defensive front Lance Mayo made the tackle but Ogilvy had a lot of convoy to get him through there he was from a poor nation again which means he turned and picks the ball he's closer to the Enron he has great speed and termination the Ian run wasn't fair when he turned up he turned up with the first two speed and determined to run through placas and he did ten yard game Billy Jackson replacing Steve Whitman for a play but Whitman is now back so you have Nathan go to the iformation and said Nathan why the left side Oh Toby looks at me like he wanted to work a little flea flicker I think he wanted to get that ball back to his quarterback but the Penn State defensive people didn't get him time Lance Mel the linebacker number 56 is an outstanding football player the leading tackler he played no starred last year so in the line he has a good knack of going through and he tackled oval day before he could laddle the ball back Keith exactly right it was a fleaflicker play with Neal down deep in the hit behind the safety man it is third down now for Alabama played 42 yard line Neal goes out of the flicker reaches the 38 there he goes down in a heap again mail is involved on the tackle along with Bruce Clark number 54 if they feel that they were running on third down thinking that they would get a big blitz and maybe have a chance to surprise Penn State and hop up the middle but at least they didn't drop it back for a pass to get the roll for a big loss like a lot of teams did all season long against this great Penn State defense art Stevenson has come out now that means it is putting time and Don Jacobs who is a specialist at killing the ball deep he could hit the knuckleball now he comes running up so here was a gadget play and they used too much time he had to get it on a quick snap to get it away but if they're going to bunt the ball anyhow now I'm sure it's relatively academic they were going to run a plate keep what they would do and they've gotten Penn State to substitute there plenty return team and taking their regularly face out and so they were going to fake a pub run up run a play and hopefully make a first time bears one of the best at gadget plays in the history of this game nobody has caused the rule to be rewritten more than Paul O'Brien tell me about it I've been on the committee I'm free hiphop beauty hanger and it things into the instead of ricocheting toward the corner it bounced straight in a 43yard punt we have three minutes and 13 seconds to play in the first quarter no score Joe Paterno the head football coach at Penn State University fine man all there Brian almost well he's a legend the hit man at Alabama Penn State's goal first found after 20 goes in motion made a mistake left side of a lion jump Jim Brown number 75 jumped before the ball was snapped illegal procedure against the Lions and that gets the grimace from the head coach worth pointing out I think that Alabama against the Penn State defense is 1 for 67 yards already and if you remember penn state allowed only a little more than 54 per game during the season in fact one team Keith rushed over 100 yards Syracuse got 113 but the reason is I think is the Penn State has not seen the wishbone at home and they taste a little Bob get a custom adjusted to the speed with which bone possesses first down at 15 from the 15th of Penn State same motion it bangs in there for a couple of yards up to maybe the 18 call it second down and seven and three minutes to go in the first quarter and it's a tight tense defensive football game right now both teams however have shown us that they have rocks funnylooking libecki's they built their Penn State's been handicapped with two penalties on two of their three possessions deep in their territory tough to make a first down and to get and in danger zone going to go deep with it going 450 and it is incomplete defending is number 17 he ran all the way with it they got a little tangled up going down the sidelines but the official was right with him we can see this get going on the deep pattern he's going to try test Crumlin who is noted to be at a slower foot you might saying you see a little pushing and shoving there if it's accidental most of the time the officials will ignore it unless the ball is white there was way overthrown officials thought it was not interference and so for Penn State it is third down and 12 from their own 18 yard line with two and a half minutes to go in the first quarter we get a new football that young man there is Rickey Tucker but he was injured in an easy workout the other day a freak accident and he is the free safety for this ball club and a very important figure and they're going to miss him I bet you before the day is done so they'll have to kick it away from the 19 yard line as Byron brags the big sophomore ran down the Penn State quarterback I think the Penn State coaches felt that Hasina would only have to have a great day hitting the third down pass is the critical situation but he has not so far in the game it's good to funny he'll hit it from about his 13 major MobileMe his feet Alabama's gonna get good field position here over there receiving it at the 42 down back at the 41 good downfield coverage by the Nittany Lion 92 Rick Donaldson down there and this Saturday on ABC's Wide World of Sports live from Honolulu our hula bowl at 4:00 Eastern 3 central in 1 Pacific and they have a tremendous gathering of athletes to participate in this year's hula bowl just look at those names that's our who's who in ballets football of 78 just beyond the 41 Alabama first down for the time roll back whooping is in motion that is Nathan for the outside he breaks it Alabama is running against Penn State that play goes all the way to the 42 good for 16 yards if that was the quick flip the quick pitch to Nathan watch it right here but you'll see the key is witless block and the key also being Nathan's thinking inside setting up his block right there by Whitman frees him into the secondary and watched him blow that shoulder like a good back sure that's outstanding football player built in a theater average 649 all his career in Alabama brick Neal taken on the play he would come off the field but you can see he is walking easily and his first to be all right Tim Travis replaces him 212 pound junior from Bessemer our best winners right in the Birmingham area Nathan now has gained 31 yards on four carries it is Alabama's ball first down at the Penn State 42 in the first quarter no score maybe a check off inaudible here is what they took a long time they shift at the 38yard line of 10 estate most of the football game has been played on 10 states in defeat the reason is at Penn State cannot make a first down while their people there in the field and when you punt the football in Alabama has very good field position Penn State jumped into a 5 3 on that occasion right now and that was the first time they've used it it here's Notre Dame leading Houston 6 to nothing in the first quarter thirtyeight and here's thrown down by Fredrik og number 83 defensive in Keith what happened on that play is most interesting I like to point out they would have ivory that complained before they hit the handoff this time they showed them the 5/3 moved over into an older ship and that village came flying through and disrupted everything in the backfield good defensive call all this backup day 42 third down tumbling coming off the snap and right there is number 16 Matt Millen the pounce on him losses back to the 45 and Alabama off out again yeah he almost he's lucky to fall back on the ball in situations like that and so the first quarter is history in this 1979 river bowl game and there is no score between Alabama and Penn State we begin the second quarter of play in the game here in the Sugar Bowl between top ranked Penn State numbertwo ranked Alabama woody Humphrey is in to kick for Alabama on fourth down Sujit for the corner okay inside the 441 yards but here are the numbers of the first quarter and looked at the yards rushing for Alabama 81 yards which is the civil more than the 80 made last year that due to the average last year 55 yards I'm a possession 10 minutes for Alabama and 36 seconds only for for Penn State they've got the mix of first downs in their town backed up where absolutely necessary very careful down here Bob Corey the fullback Booker Moore is the tailback maybe the six yard line he is the quickest of the Penn Stater running backs Notre Dame now has moved out to a 12 nothing lead in the frigid Cotton Bowl and Dallas says Buchanan has run it in from a yard for the Irish bitter cold day in Dallas at the six yard line it is second down double wide to the right side you see now get him inside the five ears an allamerican at work number 93 Marty Lyon Marty Lyons is an allamerican football player you can see him just charge through trying to get penetration guys and bleep and the green effort is pop for for long I was back at the free yard line where it is third down and 11 when the three and the four out of the endzone it is Tori and more to be close to the first down Warren Lau's the freshman nose guard for Alabama had fought his way through the traffic and was in for pursuit of Fusina in the endzone and chuck calm poised senior quarterback wanted to go deep instead Nick Thomas go back and let's see where the ball is they want to bring the team if that shows the poison cacophonous all Fusina behind his own goal line a game like this he didn't get rattled he found an alternate receiver his sake pal got the ball out to him and nearly made a first man short and obviously pens faithful but I'm going to fiddle around and give some better the ball down there at this point of the ballgame the 1302 to go on the first half an interesting thing Penn State's pit formation calls to Alabama coaches one solid week of preparation to know what they did they afraid of the pain sprayed of a run from this formation it's not used by any Penn State in the country oh go VSP for Alabama once again Allen it's just but overly fair catch first an Alabama after only 48 yard line convinced rate yet to really have much field position in the ball game not giving them the opportunity to unwind they're often Penn State undefeated four times never named national champion right now we see for the first time in a bowl game number 10 Stedman Schiele and quarterback for Alabama good runner Billy Jackson the fullback rabbit flexes out from the left outside locally is trapped behind the line of scrimmage Matt Miller pouring in Schiele was actually hip he faked through his fullback and then was hit but still was able to deliver the finish well I think most of time the coaches would ask uni when he's hit before he comes out clearly to attack the defense it in keep the ball and take the walls don't think of Angela but their brawn has conference this young man put him in a game like this in this situation three second down 13 mark Kim Miller too big chuckles never gave him a chance to exercise the office deep watch part number 54 just shoot the gap inside the tackle number 63 punch is trying to block him to no avail he has the quickness and when he sees that falls theft he can penetration and he makes an outstanding play and I'm serious demoralizing the Alabama offense at this point of the game and 16 mil enjoy to Stedman chili pepper and it's all good that comes out Rutledge's back in the football this half a 14 where it is third down and eight since local bacon motion and it'll bring up fourth down and a kicking down for Alabama with 11 minutes and 10 seconds to play in the second quarter no score deep in space defense advantage involve open field position nothing those two think tackles are Justin police say they are sensational they're also probably getting a little more feel of that wishbone yes it takes time you cannot practice with a BT Nintendo they a great team like Alabama I'm Chris cake another beauty he almost hit the screen hanging in the roof Chewie and he could bring it back but no way because Humphrey what do you hung it up there five full second big Bruce Clark there on the sidelines when his teammates allamerican in 1978 and the thermal a Defensive Player of the Year only a junior so is milind only a junior all the coaches on the schedule of Penn State the next year and trying to figure out right now how to handle it now in the Cotton Bowl in Houston Houston's on the board in Dallas I should say as the Davis is thrown to Adams 15 yards for a touchdown in the second quarter that's a 127 ballgame and then 42 to go here in state yardline well he's just pass it open but he's running for his life calorie Johnson it is made a diving try for it Hugh Cena running for his life pursued by Curtis McRib and watch it you've seen those trying to throw the look in pass a double cove receiver they guessed correctly on defense Alabama forced him out of the pocket you see no throws and if all bounces like fruit off with his hands up in the air watch leg da fuxx temple right here on the right of your screen you can both live in a sensational play at the photograph Penn State has not run more than any in any possession more than three plays so it's been one two three kick what and the game is beyond the 15 by Matsui 211 pounds junior from State College and this trial his team has had the best of it so far they were ready to play they've got good field position enabled with the defensive kicking to maintain feel decision and keep Penn State back so that's the mark of a good football team Joe Paterno has sent Bob Torre in at fullback replacing sewer here that's the pendent now fuller more of the tailback and for the on third down and five from the 17 Bama expecting fast leg drop to a beach position defensively the pressure is on profit 96 the linebacker trout flipped and forced into his wife and he ran right at Hamelin the strategy key flaws that they showed the safety blitz you see normals to a plan they chained it went back in Dublin and put all the Flitz they'd go through the ball then put on the Blitz not in for a big loss 14 yard loss and standing right at the very back of the end zone is Fitch get some fun mobility receives or Alabama once again the pressure on gets it away although he feels it into the first down at the Penn State 41 with 909 to go in the second quarter an Alabama continue will play on Penn State's into the football field the program is special exclusive maybe see sports that's caused five thumbs up now with the first down at 41 Lu er and Billy Jackson sitting in the I along with major Ogilvie teichner flexing out of the wishbone run it over the right side of the big center Stevenson and moves it down close to the 37 for 4 yards deep most people tried to release their weak side blockers on the plate to the limb for instance but you better not do that applause he's right over there you cuddly somebody hold the block key however go back to the very beginning where we talked about establishing the run out of the wishbone and the key to that is the center's play against the nose guard and Stevenson's doing the job so far here's the pitch oh they'll be with it 35 to the 34 we're at Lance male linebacker it makes the stuff here we isolate a Lance male 2 linebacker on the 56 take a little block nearly gets knocked down but then he scraped off makes the tackle only over 3 after a nice game that time Frank Penn State had gone to a fourman front let's see how they line it up this time Penn State almost nothing on the ground so far the first half it was Mark who made the first contact what do you do with a number 54 he weighs 268 pounds he's quick enough to play linebacker he boldly played through there and makes the play on the draw play on Jackson said play still continue play by Bruce Clark the football is sitting after the Penn State 38 yard line it is fourth down and six I'm pretty fun it was touched in the end zone bring it out to the 20 Rick Neil was down there but he lost his footing a little bit was walking around and hit the ball in the endzone 711th ago most former staff the 1979 Sugar Bowl settling the national championship on the field of play top ranked Penn State which has been held who only eight yards rushing so far in the ballgame by the Alabama defense no score however in the game of 7eleven to go on the birthday Penn State's ball first down at the 20 the history and gubin lined up behind Poochyena and it's cumin close to the 25yard line running over the left side running behind Keith's door knee and Eric Cunningham that's a movement that time he's on the left side of in line they moved Alabama deep head back enough Abdullah the seals they like do that he cuts right through humanlike Suey a little bit quicker than you really think that first one didn't seem excited it's been so far but there is no school penetrates deep on the wheel just give them a first down and suddenly they're out close to the 35 yard line with the first guy a little bit's where they can set up their fashion and maybe take advantage of what miss John report says Alabama is fallible entice defense they doubled up that time on the middle guard and wrote him out of there and soui cut right through the hole and it's near the 35 penalty flag laughter 31yard Jim Murray leg the strong safety work lipstick referee village innings out of the big eight walking off the penalty against Penn State illegal procedure 31 yard gain wiped out beautiful execution past Athena on the Flitz hitting the back Gilman watches my kitchen white down one it'll be first down at 15 as you see the replay screens are set up by the acting of the quarterback and Fusina did an outstanding job right there is Romano the left guard number 53 was out in front of him make the block Mike limits in at quarterback replacing Ellen from differ a low Bama about faster than motion for Penn State to give their honor and that's up to the 35 yard line that's just beyond the original line of scrimmage so it's going to bring up second down and about 10 Penn State average 25 past is a game for 11 during the season Alabama coaches thought they might see as many as 40 of modifier because of the vulnerability of their secondary there's the time remaining on the school board in the Superdome Torrey is in at fullback now boomin stays at tailback is a 226 pounds soon a little bit bigger if they wanted trip a turnover in state did recover the football at maintain possession as Romano a guard in fast walking formation sorest quarterback in trouble and came back to get the ball watch Lucia they had two safety blitz number 90 is back in their horses it out of the pocket rags come aboard seven Smith's them all loose and number 53 Romano the left guard recovers for Penn State very outstanding effort on his part and the ball is all the way back after 14 but fortunately faysville owning gotta go to the 48 almost 245 for a first down so they need 31yard human drag again involved on the play with prop 77 hustling over there along with number 90 Boyd and it's fourth down and once again Penn State's fits people have to fun but near his own goal line and once again Alabama is going to get the ball in very good field position he found it a little bit surprised and overly has made a fair catch on every one of the punt 50 and he has had some Running Room they feel back for return this time and it's Fitz his best punch hanging it high and forcing him to fall fair catch he hung it up there five seconds it was a 38 yard spot Alabama's ball first down some offensive talk on the sideline Penn State bench they've been unable to get on track the football right now first down and it's close to the 47 yard line nathan is on the field but they're not using him to return punts after he hurts that hip early in the going as one hundred what gun has it first down at the Penn State 38 yard line here we see both in number 32 going down as if he's going T Gilman is covering it close to making a break play it was underthrown but golden came back in the rustle of all three and a half standing play here's again a fake adoption play fake the fullback and then throw the fangs 8 of 16 yards just inside the pencil 38 Rutledge on the option wants to throw the screen Jeff was just rented over there by and bloody Adalind out in front of the Alabama bull back in at the big plays and if one thing it was the storage a big rush is a screen pass and have subsist on it and a screen back away from the flow is very difficult if it again outstanding execution by one Rutledge he'll throw to first clocked in at Aleph and then Brock and its first down at the Penn State 22 yard line no score 320 to go first half played those in the middle the Whitman the fullback carries and he's inside the 24 the 18 yard line he's got just about four yards on that pair up call it three and you see now time getting closer and closer most of this first half has been played on the Penn State end of the pier sucking down Penn State is deep in Obama territory 150 more here now they've got two men on Clark they've got bucket but here forces abroad here's Clark thanking him food to the left and throw all phallus quitman deflected the ball and the lot makes an outstanding run back in 55 yard return for the interception first down Penn State at the Alabama 37 yard line and don't forget you see now naturally is hit hit on becquer Barry the interception 37 yard line second down and 10 no gain on the Garrett fire suey",

  "transcript": "with John Brodie we're delighted you can be with us because when the Steelers and the Browns hook up it is usually a very good one these two teams are about as emotionally high as two football teams can be and the fans are right up there with him John when you look at the Steelers you have to admire their hit coach Chuck Noll he's a quiet guy he doesn't get a lot of press but what a motivator what a leader done I think he's the best kept secret in the National Football League he's been the best coach over the past eight or ten years he's got him ready every week he's not only a technician he's also an administrator it's a rare quality he is right now the premier coach in the game well injuries are going to be a factor in this football game both teams are hurt you won't believe this crowd is unbelievable they really happen the Steelers have good backup people they've lost starters and yet their backup people look men and played like all pros I think the Steelers that's the name of the game we talked about key injuries a key injury is an injury that you can't replace so there are there is no such thing in Pittsburgh a kid like Crombie's that comes on as a down lineman starts playing great football Gary Dunn plays great football when he's asked to play better Zacks having the best year of the whole defense we already know about Lambert already know about dream but when you ask a guy like Jared Winston not only to play the middle but today move outside and play and their their level of play doesn't go down you're talking about a world champion well Sam Rutigliano knows Cleveland Browns have the same problem they've got people hurt they have to rely on backup players today I think in order for them to get into the league that pittsburgh has now attained they've got to play some of their first draft choices you're going to see a kid like today you might see a Willis Adam he's a fourfour 40yard runner a guy like Cody Rison Cody is a guard he's got to be doing some play and their offensive line is good for it to get over the hump a kid like this has to come along and play well for him and John Smith will be in there also you need everybody you got it gets to be a game of attrition after a while who do you have less well these teams have two good ones coming in like Willis Adams at wide receiver well William Willis Adams has played very well but he hasn't been given a chance to play in the games he's the kind of guy everybody expects a lot from we'll see today they need somebody to expand the defense and we've got to find quarterbacks is you know Terry Bradshaw quarterbacks the Steelers and Brian Sipe does a big job for the Cleveland Browns and they're ready and so are we and we're glad you're gonna be with us stay tuned now is we're almost set to tee it up that Brown versus the Steelers this is not tricky with John Brodie Cleveland Stadium as the Browns and the Steelers have a teed up and ready to go and that's how it stands right now in the AFC Central at the moment Houston is beating st. Louis 14 to 7 so the winner of this game will have at least a share of first place in the AFC Central bar kicks off it carries deep in newly acquired dino halls docks back up field for the Cleveland Browns get some room he's right the brilliant young punt returner kick returner for the Browns is out for this season autumn after undergoing knee surgery earlier this week the Dino heartless command that's how the offensive backfield looks all right Calvin Hills the man that's in place of Greg through it Brian sacks been having a great year he's carried him actually and if Cleveland's going to really be in the same league with Pittsburgh throughout the afternoon the rest of his club's got to come up to his level flat well I got the field position the Browns come out of the huddle they had an off game last Sunday at Houston were beaten for the first time this season the Steelers had their 12 game win streak broken last Sunday in Philadelphia teams are way up for this game here's a hand the Steelers have given up very little to the run this season the straight a hit carriers out across the 35 yard line to about the 37 I'm talking to Jim sharpener and Sam Rutigliano before the ballgame he said we're we know we can go to these fellas these are our big play people Rucker Logan Newsome but what we've got to do and it's an old cliche is established that we can run he said previously in the last couple games we've established we could not and that's not the way we wanted to go well if you can establish again run against this outfit this dealers you get some offense elephant Hill Alliance now behind through it I formation two wide receivers to the left and Calvin Hill drives the bot on a second and six carry out across the 41 yard line the Cleveland Browns in the Pittsburgh Steelers have been meeting since 1950 this is the 59th beating in the series and these are the fellas that have to move people around George Baylor has moved his spots from right guard the left guard he feels like he's playing better Tom de Lyonne is the real spearhead in the middle Henry Shepherds moved from guard to tackle they're pretty solid offensive line for the Cleveland Browns is Ricky feature it is third down and about three for the Cleveland Brown surely they'll mark you down yet we jumped in jump back in time so the first break of the game goes to the Pittsburgh Steelers and they don't get breaks they make them I think Don what you're going to see is a lot of times fumbles happen because people get to the ball carrier before he's ready to have them do so it wasn't the case this time dirt Winston just got a good piece of the ball play tackle through it caused a fumble the first big turnovers Fitchburg Chuck Noll now congratulates his defense as they come up with a big play again they've allowed only 71 points this season has the Pittsburgh defense and a lot of those are resulting in turnovers giving the other team good field position he does a turn the ball over 16 times this year it's 1st in 10 Pittsburgh no score 75 to read fiction inside and certain the fit back is not done yet if he brings the ball all the way down inside the 20yard line done Joe Gordon the PR man for Pittsburgh estate of so he says he can't understand it we all know about Rocky Bleier Franco Harris he said Sidney Thorton is carrying this club offensively right now you can see he turns a fouryard gain into it about a 25 yard and he's the been the big play man for Pittsburgh it's Bradshaw Thorton and Harris in the backfield and so the Steelers capitalizing at an early turnover after Cleveland towards first in 10 at the 17yard line of flavor to the 10 yard line charlie ha Cleveland's leading tackler coming to the game at the left linebacker 59 was on the hits for the Browns so right away the Steelers come out they want to run the football they'd like to keep their offense on the field they're btf defense give it as much rust as they can ok it's a pretty windy day Bradshaw would like to throw sparingly he's got an outstanding receiver in John Stallworth we know swans hurt Jim Smith's a pretty good fillin then Randy Grossman is playing divine football John Starwood the right flank in a second and for for the Steelers and he takes the ball down to the 12 yard line Cleveland's regular middle linebacker dick Ambrose will only be used for spot duty today he's got a back problem in there in his stead is 56 Robert Jackson a former number one draft choice out of Texas A&amp;M and he just went against an allpro center in Webster and Webster won well that lineup right there if you're playing defense you know these fellows are going to trap you the problem is you don't know when and you don't know who but when you talk with these fellows offensively think trap with anybody in the game the left tackle is a great football player for the Steelers John Cole now in the backfield Sydney Carton for the Steelers no score first quarter relativity they signal it touch to anyone having ham had it long enough you had possession when he crossed the plane of the goal line the hands went up it is a touchdown Steelers John I think he was going for a little spike action as he crossed the goal line it's a good thing he did it before he after he got there I've seen several guys go through their act before they got there and then it would have been a sixpoint mistake does you watch cunningham pick up the ball a little bit low throw he just got there I'll tell you he hit her with his knee yeah yeah I think he's gonna go into one of those damn this is just a little delay block done he tries to let the linebackers get into there drop it comes across the middle of six though now it's seven Matt Barr hits the extra point and so the Steelers capitalized early on a brown fumble Pittsburgh Steelers this is Don quickie with John Brodie Steelers capitalized early there in the end zone right away they knew they had to get started fast they did it alright we're ready now for the Steelers second kickoff of this football game Dennis Winston recovering that fumble on Cleveland's first possession now back again is Dino hall to receive and that fire who hit the extra points ready to kick off for the Steven the football Sun starting to break through a lot Oh in here it's going to be effect as the game wears on ha loses the handle get across the 20yard line they got some great NBC pictures of that last touchdown the first of the game watch this now we mentioned Benny Cunningham he was in for Grossman to tight end situation he blocks let's the linebackers clean out then when he comes across it's very difficult to tell whether or not he just crossed the goal line or whether he just got there a little prematurely but you can see he's letting the linebackers go beating the flow you see the ball got hit he's trying to get control of it he was in ruled by the referee that's all it's counted you see it a couple different ways our producer here today for NBC is Larry Cirillo our director Ted Nathanson we're in the first quarter the Cleveland Browns have their second possession now they've had a problem moving the ball and the Steelers closed it down fast and hard they're looking at Joe green I think they're going to devil up on him this afternoon Joe green has played very well against the run you can see he stands up the guards it's very difficult when you have when the man you have to pick on is an 8 to 10year veteran number 75 he's bent they've been running at him they haven't run effectively at him all year he only goes to the Pro Bowl every year jill green back in good health he'll sit greenwood is back in a Steeler lineup he's at left in this four games with injuries now the Browns try to go to the run and there's nothing there Calvin Hill gets a full load and coming up to get him as John vanna's ACK back in his hometown of Cleveland Ohio playing the right end for the Pittsburgh Steelers defensive line of the Steelers we mentioned Gary Dunn bana Zac Beasley they're not the fellas that you're associating with with the greatness of the Pittsburgh defenses over the years but the Pittsburgh defense has not dropped in its play and it's changed in its personnel john Banaszak having his best year of all time it is third down and seven Paul takes it out across the 30 and he might have a first down now as you know breakthrough does opera Cleveland they're great little step back then we picked up Hall and he provides some of that outside speed which the big backs don't have it's got excellent speed and he needed at that time he just outran all of pursuit hams got a little cold hamstring Jack Lambert playing injured Dennis Winston had to move over to the corner so you see they've got kind of a makeshift defense but they've still been tough here's some guys who can play football JT Thomas starting at a corner for Ron Johnson Mel Blount consensus allpro year and year out Donnie Schell brown coaches think he might be the best guy back there the strong safety a lot of football talent in the secondary the Steelers goal roster 45 they all are upstanding the world champions and expect to be again this is the confidence with both even right now in a first down carry the Browns move it out again they get good blocking from the left side the tackle is Deacon number 73 the guard is peeler 64 and Dee Lyon moved out nicely at center and hit the middle linebacker the Steelers Jack Lambert they're going to have to get that kind of movement out of their offensive line they put a big burden on Italy I said you fellas have to move their defense backwards in order for us to move the ball and control it if we can't throw when we want to if they're dictating to us when we have to throw we're in trouble I am site now steps down his Cleveland Brown on a second down and long five play at the 36 yard line of Cleveland pitch bacteria's Mike is stopped by Dennis Winston the outside linebacker Winston got him first and then knocked him down so right now we have 9 minutes and 50 seconds left to play in the first quarter the clock is running hit Cleveland and the Steelers are in the late 70s over the middle rifle by Bradshaw a tight end Benny Cunningham got it into the end zone you see what they do riki feature and Reggie Rutger their wide receivers Hill was there Calvin Hill was open but scythe had to come in high as the big Steelers linemen were in his face very difficult the handicap this win is you know John Edmond down on the field looking at it closely and feeling it on the playing surface it's a swirling wind coming off Lake Erie which is a hundred yards away Johnny Evans hits the punt didn't help anybody on the hop that takes a little Cleveland roll inside the 30 and the Steelers will go back on offense first in 10 Kansas City under another coach you don't hear a lot about but he really has his team prepared Marv levy they win their fourth game of the season and the city video now dropping the throw on a first down John star without a straight fly release coming down will and Bradshaw with that gun arm puts it right on the number what a beautiful throw it's the kind of throw that nobody had a chance to catch the ball but stallworth from the time it was thrown he saw them in the double zone coverage to people trying to cover play centerfield he's got a good play action pass looks off got Tom Darden to react down toward the left side of the field if he can move his eyes around get get dardan reacting to him he can have a big day if he can't he's trouble Bradshaw has primary problem this year has been interceptions he's been picked up eight times Franco Harris gets the call and a first down carry he advances of all close to the 27 yard line Charlie Hall 59 made the stop for the Cleveland Browns but right now the Steelers have been dominating this football game on Cleveland's first possession if you joined us late a fumble Dennis Winston got it for the Steelers four plays later they were in the end zone on the payoff and it was Terry Bradshaw a tight end Benny Cunningham at 7 nothing now and the steal all pro pass catcher is not in this game he's out of here by the Cleveland linebackers Robert ballgame the Eagles up in there record of five and one he catches the ball on 34 here's the pitch and penny he has stuck in cardcounter Davis came up in baingan but it was too little too late as Connie hit makes the first down reception at the 15 yard but the 12 yard line let's keep in mind Cunningham weighs over 250 pounds he's an outstanding athlete he can run patterns across the middle and he is the leader when he's going across the middle those defensive backs aren't going to wrap him the way they'd like to wrap those little wide receivers when they do get a piece of him they better hang on a lot of any 250 pounds Jim Smith from Michigan the man that Navy coach George Welsh girl the best receiver he's ever seen college football is to the right he runs a football first time Kara he got about three it gives you an idea how deep and how strong the Steelers are when I got it one top coaches this is the best college receiver he's ever seen only gets to start with somebody's hurt but when wen Suan has been hurt Smith has played extremely well there's Lynn Swann wearing his number 88 in his Willie Stargell hat looks like he's getting ready for the World Series Charlotte's enemy okay I'm touchdown hippie boy with 552 still the flame about 13 and up and jumping you just can't ask your linebackers to cover all over the football field both his wide receivers were covered just like a blanket Bradshaw wants to go out to the right then it comes back now finally it comes over to Thornton across the middle to win out to the right side it came all the way across the field found himself open Bradshaw hit him let's take a look at Robert Jackson there's going to be a burden on him below he runs right in now he's already run his pattern this is 107 second pattern back to the live coverage the extra point by bar it is up and good and so the world champions had taken command of this football game but we've got a long way to go it's 14 nothing Pittsburgh over Cleveland we'll be back in a moment this but for all the people who make the sidelines a part of the show yeah just three year that distinctively clean crisp taste that says Budweiser with John Brodie this is Don Ricky back at Cleveland stadium the Steelers have taken command of this game in the first quarter 14 nothing as bar kicks up again Dino Hall waits the ball at the five yard line accelerates ahead across the 20yard line up to the 25 high draft choice number two coming down and he makes the special teams in and that's the only way you can make the Pittsburgh team you're not going to get right into the lineup playing either offense or defense you go down and take on a few wedges you can find a spot for yourself on the roster Zack Valentine we had a great play yeah at this point now does Cleveland have to come out of its game plan and start firing I don't think so it's a little early to get out of whatever that going into the ballgame they wanted to run it I think they've shown they can but ciphers the thrower and he's been getting this theme by him his arm Seymour LeBron said the coaches of Kabul Africa he catches the phone on Wagner it's a first down for the brown Ozzie Newsome a strong tight end who's got the excellent speed gets down here's an upset the Chicago Bears in a hail storm at Buffalo on a oneyard run by Walter Payton with just over a minute to play in the game beat the Buffalo Bills 7 nothing Atlanta back on reg now after Green Bay's big win Monday night over New England Atlanta on the home field beats the Packers 25 to 7 Lanning out three and three the Packers are two and four triumph site with the big my crew it does well to elude Green moment children get ahead for Leon adjust green hand at the line of scrimmage a very nice four or five yard game we mentioned dirt Winston he's got to play the outside see how he does number 53 you can see he doesn't go for much Calvin Hills trying to get a piece of him see if he can't help Mike Frueh he does his job through it picks up four but it was a nice run to get it so far both teams have run ten plays that the Steelers have to leave this Greg put on the sidelines the allpurpose back he has a stray knee there was some concern he might need surgery but that is not the case he might be back as early as next and the second area the Pittsburgh Steelers we could have a car going against Pittsburgh which would be resulted in a first down the point of infraction referee today is Jim honey he's going to give us the call I'm gonna go against the Steelers John it is it's going to be first down for the Browns they need to sustain a drive we're getting at some point five yards per cell type alternating wide receiver Newsom is aligned to the right wind is really gusting now is going to be tough to throw us Ricky's pictures in his head first down for the drive so now they Monticello it was not a wellthrown ball by sight but it was a very well fielded ball by Fichter what he did is he goes down to field the playaction pass he freezes the linebackers gives himself quite a bit of the field to play with and he's thrown the ball a little more in the middle features got it on the dead run however feature did slow down enough to force blood to come over the top of him drew a penalty keeps their drive alive sure does the best field position of the game now for the Cleveland Browns they have the ball down to the 21 yard line of the Pittsburgh Steelers we have 411 left to play first quarter Steelers jumped out their first two possessions to a 14nothing lead it's first in 10 browse the 21 yard line with Steelers it's Calvin Hill and he's down inside the 15yard line superb execution as sight stood tall against the big run it looked like an audible now you don't hear much about audibles down anymore but it looked like Pittsburgh was in a blitz a six or a seven man blitz Lambert was the only one that was in the middle of the field that puts Wagner mantoman on Calvin Hill a perfect throw throwing situation on a playaction pass he took advantage of it so the Browns have something going now is Cleo Miller goes into their backfield numbers there with him Rutger is wide to the right Dave Logan whooping whooping second and typically on owner up the bar right into the heart of the Steeler defense you don't get hit once you get hit one two three times in that play and Down Goes Miller he did get a couple pleased with the white Bernard this in the first quarter he's got a first down for the brows good offensive search both guards they were ahead of center Tom Daley Oh just enough search to pick up a first down that one or two yards it's not an automatic it's not easy here's Henry Shepherd on the right 65 Jackson on the right at the right guard Dee Lyon real good offensive surge gave her a chance to pick up the first so now the browser challenging there's 15,000 here from try to get somebody elected okay when do you get a pretty good football team out of some of these I praise you come into follow this dealers they were ready last night I don't know to the end zone ball is tipped the Steeler linebacker Jack Lambert people talk about how good Lambert is and stopping the run but he's one of the most effective linebackers patrol in that middle he gets in the proper lane all the time and he's very tough to throw on and it really helps those safeties jettison Jack Lambert grew up not far from Cleveland was a Browns fan all his life never missed a game no Browns fan anymore these two teams don't like each other they get after it Jack Lambert the middle linebacker dropping back in that zone coverage and he tipped the ball so now it's second get a first down they get the best the one is just outside the 10 yard line it's back go here he's down to the six yard line so a third down play comes up and I think John Brodie we could see his site throw into the end zone well certainly we could it's no easy trick to pick up five yards when you're down in the six yard line on third down it's the toughest situation for a quarterback I'm sure that you know teams get in to drills where you say inside the 10 yard line what's our best third down play you're going to see it right now and I don't turn it back why did Yahoo you run out of room everybody crowd you and there are no patterns that you can run effectively down there you just have to get one on one situation somewhere and messed up right now it's going to be tough for by incitement it Browns offense third at the six into the a little bit high I think he would have come down outside the end zone so the kicking team goes out would have been a great catch but scythe did throw the ball the only place he had a chance to make the reception so now a very capable place kicker particularly when the weather's bad like it is today with this gusting wind on CAC Krupp comes on the playing field for the Cleveland Browns his site goes up he actually threw the ball over 40 times last year considering the number of plays that would call back on penalties Sam Rutigliano says we don't to be thrown a football 40 times you usually don't win a game when you do that and it certainly did not last week here's Pat crowd he hasn't missed many though he hits it he's wide Cockcroft doesn't get it there the swirling wind he is wide and so a good Browns drive comes up empty 1:22 left to play in the first quarter and the Steelers give up yardage but they do not give up points as we watch that kick again here is the seemingly pointblank field goal attempt to Don rough but as we see it just goes wide to the right hit pretty solid but you can see it comes in a little late and mr. crow right disappoint he doesn't miss him from way out let alone in close but oddly enough he's over to that distant fish first three games of the year he put him on the window right now the Steelers use their power game as driving straight ahead into tech ol Sims and shirk is Franco Harris NBC sports world coming up in two weeks in October 20th you'll see two of the hardest hitters in boxing go toetotoe for the WBA heavyweight championship of the world undefeated Big John Tate goes against undefeated Harry cook see a live from Victoria South Africa now so you'll see action with the less sevillio celebrity poker tournament but a world championship fight coming up October 20th on NBC pullin he got up really question who is the hitter and who is the hit he when he runs into a defense because he's dealing it out to Jackson got him finally along with Ron bolt but there's good yardage the New England Patriots had to work hard and come from behind to beat Detroit today 24 217 Lions lost another quarterback home low went down in that game it's third and less than two yards now for the Pittsburgh Steelers the brought up their 29 yard the first quarter is in its final seconds right down the Steelers are in the late 14th is going to take up the we mentioned 71 yards for a touchdown a guy as you said at 230 pounds Tom dart is a free safety free Safety's was known for their speed he did not have more than his fried on Darden as he left the line of scrimmage got through the secondary he maintained it and extended it once he got down to film now here's a man can fly he's stated in his own in his own words he's gotten off to a slow start he certainly hasn't started slow today interesting the longest run in his career prior to this was a 75yard putting down running that was against the Cleveland Browns so now fires up to try an extra point again it's definitely first quarter pittsburgh 21 cleveland nothing we'll be right back after these messages from your local station our creepy camera from the end zone gives you a look at this play as an offensive back would look at a defense when he breaks through there you can see you just need one little crack there's nobody in the secondary they've got ten minute the line of scrimmage doing all they can to stop them from making a first down but they didn't stop them from making a touchdown Sam Rutigliano were on the left Chuck Noll on the right around the right tackle through a great block after the tight end gross the new block down on the line back yard it's 21 nothing now Dino has a problem with the football well the worldchampion is fired last week with man people can make a lot of noise because it sounds like this was a Chris Berg well I think Pittsburgh did why was so untypical of them last week in the dressing room for some reason they were they were uh not accustomed to to being the way they were they're a little nervous a little tense just kind of ready for the ballgame they knew this was big for them look at the way they get after that ball down the field Dino Smith didn't know where they came from but they did get the ball from Michigan State Tom graves was have a football so now the Steelers challenge yet again first and ten at the 12 yard line of Cleveland Burton gets outside good play by Hall caught him from behind outside linebacker 59 Charlie Hall get big sit Thornton so far the Browns have turned the ball over twice the first one was converted into the first score of the game by the Pittsburgh Steelers and now is we're early in the second quarter it is 21 nothing Pittsburgh now this game should get any more out of hand we're going to switch out to Denver where the San Diego Chargers and the Broncos are hooked up in a scoreless game that's if the Steelers start to blow this one wide open if they have not effect on that already well 21 is you can come back from there 20 Jim Smith diving catch touchdown Pittsburgh Steelers he's the replacement for Lynn Swann now that's about as fine a catch as you're going to see all year he knew he had it all away though that the end zone is a little bit soft in there Bradshaw made a pretty good throw but it was a great catch the little playaction he's putting the ball the only place anybody can grab it he beats bull you think Terry cares they say another big factor in Pittsburgh success they don't believe now in Bradshaw few years ago he'd have the great game in the off game they know that he's going to take them the distance he's done it here's the extra point attempt it's wide by bar that wind out that end of the field the open end is going to be effective but with 1407 left to play in the first half the Pittsburgh Steelers have moved out in front 27 and up he will be back at Cleveland in a moment and now that fire is ready to kick it up once again for the Pittsburgh Steelers that they've taken command of this game thing early in the second quarter dime quickie with John Brodie at Cleveland you know ha who saw the last kickoff return result in a fumble subsequent recovery and then on to the touchdown the Browns have done that twice in this game this telecare are they Steelers have the telecast is presented by authority of the National Football League and is intended for the private use of our audience any rebroadcast or other use of this telecast without the express written consent of the Cleveland Browns in the National Football League is prohibited so Bob will do it all over again back at the 30 Johnna Cleveland Browns aren't sure what's happened to them that they know it is not good and Pittsburgh has not made one mistake all day long that's throughout a whole first quarter of football they scored a touchdown every time they got their hands on the ball and they haven't allowed Pittsburgh Cleveland office to really move the ball effectively there's a hole in you wouldn't know if he's ahead 27 or nothing behind it he doesn't change the interesting story about when he was hired by the Steelers back in 1969 they interviewed him the day after Baltimore been upset by the Jets in Super Bowl 3 and his composure in the opinion leading us out of the wilderness he's done that been the coach in the NFL since 72 you know how's that done yet the little guy comes out across the 35 yard line gets to the 37 Randy Grossman playing special teams he goes both ways for the Steelers made the hit now Cleveland try to get something cookin again they've not moved the bottle doll they did the one possession you remember got it down close and then the field goal attempt by rough was just wide a lot of good a lot of good things that have got to happen for Cleveland to even get back in the ball game they've got to score the ball score twice economy's a group score is just like this dealers like it it's getting a little ugly now misty winds as Brian well phone call Kelvin nice played for the Cleveland Browns and he'll need many more though David Hill runs patters runs patterns with any halfback in the game he gives himself a lot of room when he gets gets by the linebackers little playaction pass you can see both dirt winstram and that is Jack Lambert out there trying to recoup on me and make a big play just a very well thrown ball Browns think they could get an over man there Winston normally a backup middle linebacker is outside right now starting today Houston the leading st. Louis 1710 fourth quarter game so the Oilers looking to hold of their share of the AFC Central League it's first out of 10 now for the Browns 32 yard line Pittsburgh in lionsearch gonna go down slowly and in almost in pieces well he bat snap from the center when that happens get what you can fall on the ball and go back regroup 7/7 is the score at the Superdome in New Orleans the Rams in the Saints Galbraith ran in for a touchdown for New Orleans Wendell Tyler came back and scored for the Rams 5yard run Sam Rutigliano quarterback coach Jim shot new year old pal from San Francisco job they're looking a little Club right now you got to go way down your bag of tricks 27 to nothing gets a hit for a first down to the 21 yard line but the Browns moving nicely off the snap of the ball get the break in a stealer defensive front Donnie shale and Mike Wagner the safeties were on the tackle it's going to be first down now for Cleveland as they've advanced the ball at the 21 yard line of Pittsburgh first half clock shows 11:55 to play well yo Miller comes in the backfield of the Browns dad there's so much time left but just a little bit of a letdown by Pittsburgh quit allow Cleveland to get back in the ball game we've seen watch stranger things happen and just a couple weeks ago in psychics electric somebody else inside the five play the ball was intended for another guy and Newsom grabbed a tip made the reception it was intended for Miller but Newsom came back he was simply a decoy on the play benefit back around JT Thomas made a fine play he didn't even know Cleo was in the area the big guy from Bama Ozzie Newsome brings the Browns down close they'll have it first and goal from the 2 yard line temperature in guy inside prozac takes a look into the end zone it up and swinging my crew it lost the ball I had both hands out though he should have caught it well when it rains it pours you know the ball was thrown a little hard sigh factually had a lot of time he didn't expect to have as much time as he was given and she'll just kind of ran into a bobble ball take a look here's a little bootleg play he's got rising out in front of him he finds Mike threw it in the end zone little bobble allows shale to get on the ball and they get another turnover Steelers are getting it every which way the browser to down most wires have come up empty it is 22,000 it up big Pittsburgh here's a great RadioShack bargain for people on the go a take along realistic entertainment system it's an am/fm radio for music and news a cassette tape player with this builtin mic I can record lectures meetings even personal notes anywhere right now at radio now the Cardinals have come back tied up Houston 1717 in the fourth quarter the Otis brown went from three yards out for Cardinal touchdown Kevin Central Division at game and up Cartman it's out on the first intently to the 27 yard line they say Ted marchibroda job is on the line should Baltimore lose this week there's Dallas holy to a 107 lead over Minnesota hold on get down at 3:00 Franco runs gets the ball up to the 28 yard line now the brown stick down to quest dealers they go to the power run Thornton puts his head down Cleveland's already hit him knock him down short of the first down so the Browns will get a ball back now on the punt for the first time in this game Nikki Sims number 78 the left tackle made the hit and also on to the Cleveland Brown they've got it earlier for Spieth right the fine country Turner the operation this the way the putter sees it live Drive front by Colquitt Dino Hall is going to have a problem here as he looks and everything play I've done yet lost the ball again briefly but got it back he's out to the 39 yard line first for the Pittsburgh Steelers was Larry Anderson but he missed him and right now we'll take a break in the action with a Steeler still in command 27 to nothing action on NBC first at 12:30 Eastern Time NFL 79 with Bryant Gumbel and Mike Adamle and a look at Wild West football Canadian style in Calgary then most of the country will see the big inter conference matchup between the highpowered Patriots and the Bears with Walter Payton who won the game today at Buffalo other key games Buffalo at Miami the Seahawks and the Chargers Denver through it comes out wide and he is down inside the 45 yard line before a Lambert finally ran him down and there again they're trying to pick on Dennis Winston that he's an outstanding middle linebacker he hasn't played the outside he has to go in because two or three injuries have occurred they have been able to isolate him a couple times when they have they've been effective still haven't got any points on the board it's a long way back from 277 man that is a big hole you've dug yourself 27 nothing Pittsburgh is in the lead the Browns have moved the ball on two possessions once they were down pointblank range and intercepted in the end zone stuff them another time it's boy and poet on a first down carry rips ahead for close to ten yards he got second one Dennis Winston fifty premade the tackle Pruett comes into the game as Cleveland's leading rusher he's averaging three and a half yards to carry he's up close to 300 yards for the season after his efforts here in the first half the Steelers with Banias a contrite in down at right tackle has pronounced Joe Greene and Greenwood the front Kelvin Hale and he's down close to the 32 yard line Kelvin Hill gets a first down for the Cleveland Browns with 706 to play in the first half I really think Cleveland has a chance to get back in the ball game it's very difficult to keep your intensity level as high as they had also stop the threepoint attempt here his size of a Lima laughing it into the end zone Rutger is in it's a touchdown look like a defensive Finley and that's what we're talking about that time Rutger goes down beats a little double coverage there was really nothing to it and then he just ran a ran a simple little pattern he was down there beating two people and as I threw the ball it's like Oh harm how easy it is here we go Reggie Rutger this is the double coverage he's got Donnie shale who he who thinks he's going to make the cut down about a 15 yards deep he just turns it outside throws on the ball and they've closed the gap a bit yep indeed here is a good throw and Rucker right out there takes it make sure he's got it into the end zone he goes for the car was against the Steelers and the play goes and the Browns are on the board for the first time in the game and he has right through the uprights so at 6:28 left to play in the first half now the score is Pittsburgh Steelers 27 the Cleveland Brown 7 he'll be back in Cleveland Stadium in a moment a stray need for Cleveland's allpurpose back the farmer of Oklahoma sooner boy can he play not big enough to play they told it was a five foot two inch tight end in high school you'd probably taught the other guys over get over the shoulder I pay the it might be down but they're pretty high as their defense now comes running out onto the field so it will be first intent for the Pittsburgh Steelers they have a twenty seven two seven Lee they've converted to brown fumble recoveries in two subsequent touchdowns they've done it without lynn swann which stands on the sidelines winners tell jokes and losers say deal says wins one if this games Dillon you know we're still play in this game two and a half quarters to go has been sold out for seven six weeks and the bounds finally knock him down but five yards downfield here's a penalty coming in John after the play I I don't think it was I don't think it was her for anything after the play I think it was a holding penalty we'll see this is a bit this is a big a big series of plays for Cleveland you know they could have 17 points would be right in the thick of thing but they're playing well offensively their defense knows it if they can hold them as they did the last night they still get within reach you know 13 points is not out of reach they only need one touchdown to get within that area there's Jim honey I referee : 10 log number 38 so first out said the Thornton was caught holding and so now the Steelers are set back to their 10yard line it'll be first in 20 we'll look at it again take a look Sidney Thornton's the man that got caught we're trying to help out his back while Jackson and comes upon us again MacLaren's Scott the strong saftey who came in for the Cleveland Brown so the knockdown is made and the Steelers fall you know you get a funny feeling about this game John I just you just have the feeling sometimes you felt you could almost feel Pittsburgh just get a little bit listless after they got the 27th point and now Cleveland getting seven points on the board has kind of pumped up they know they have a chance to get back in it it's a home crowd and a lot stranger things have happened now some new people come down the brown defense rich dimmer a big tough tackle from Southern California they go to a we've got six defensive back really starting up in Cleveland now jerry shirk number 72 an all pro football player makes the big play you can tell the people in the stands feel the same thing when you get a twenty seven to seven game and the home team's got the seven and the fans are excited as these people are there's something going on here that I'm not quite aware of but they're going to get the ball back they've got plenty of time to put another drive together Simpson happened in here in Cleveland now his shirt makes the big blade a long way to go 450 to play in I'll get some of it back but not nearly enough and the Browns will get the football back Lyle Alzado 77 on the snap for Cleveland Darry shirts a tough guy to block well shirt gets good penetration Sam Davis trying to handle sir cologne is a tough thing to do he does his job he gives flyer a chance to get into the secondary just too many yards to pick up 57 he comes over the top and now call Christi go quit well he can hit it Newsome signals for makes a fair catch so now the Browns go on offense first antenna we pause briefly for station identification this is the NBC television network this is WI CTV your new spirit station in Pittsburgh here's a big score fourth quarter Astrodome Houston Texas Cardinals 24 the Houston Oilers 17 Wayne Morris just scored with 235 left so that holds up the winner of this game will take over sole possession of first place in the AFC Central second quarter the Chargers and Broncos still at that foot points up that was a 48 yard punt by craig : of the steelers first in ten site picks them up the completion is made the mic crew it is ahead to the 41 yard line didn't get much get some got three stores coming in as the one o'clock games are winding up second quarter score now this was a a pick off at Baltimore they cope pick off at Baltimore they cope deleting the Jets 10 to nothing Baltimore winless going into the game Dallas has now moved out in front 17 to 7 over Minnesota they're playing at Bloomington Minnesota Dorsett has run for two touchdowns for Dallas from three yards out both time last time Cleveland played at home back in second out of six now for Cleveland they go to the Jacqueline Burton takes the bomb of the 50yard line it's a first time for the Cleveland Browns offensively Cleveland is moving the ball there probably as effective as anybody's been against Pittsburgh all year long and they as we mentioned they've got over 30 minutes to play they've got over three minutes in this half and they're moving they really are they're moving the ball against the Steelers more than seven points now at getting out of bounds through it not only got the first down but he stopped the clock with 3:13 left to play in the right there 49 yard line site crops he's looking at a little and allpro cornerback almost have the interceptions Mel Blanc six four ways 218 pounds he's a cornerback that he can fly you can get downfield they say John on oneonone coverage he's as good as there is on the keys I think he is as good Luis Wright is outstanding he Jimmy Johnson it's funny all those fellows are built alike they're over six foot tall long legs and it can really cover usually you don't see the longlegged fellas playing corner but these are exceptions dealers are very selling though in man in Africa they put blood oneonone a lot with a classy show Hendley markers go down Ozzie Newsome was running a deep atom he's always a threat he could be more as the game wears on last week when they were upset by the Philadelphia Eagles he's been through the earth with defensive encroachment of fiveyard assessment will be marked up against the Pittsburgh Steelers last week against Philadelphia correctly the tight end for the Eagles on a straight release on the tight end position got 92 yards in four catches of course Prince 7568 still second down rich coke tight one of the assistant coaches for the Browns says the guy they're really concerned about is shell back there look at this tells you how good Pittsburghers been coming into this ball game the Cleveland's moving the ball five now for the Cleveland Brown 46 yard line of Pittsburgh site fake nursin catches the ball so Brian Sipe did very well not only to elude the Russians to get rid of the bother there's a completion he sure did a good job to get rid of the ball he had none of his receivers open he was caught this is the bad this is with it you're having a little problem you don't have any backs out he kept a few backs in to help lock Greenwood got by a few blockers early what he did so sight made a fine play just to get rid of it the one thing John you have to be concerned about when you play the pittsburgh steelers is the fourth quarter this year they've outscored the opposition in the fourth quarter 52 to 7 they come at you in the last 15 minutes hard they came they came at the Browns pretty hard too first quarter good day what do you want nothing at the end of the first couple plays into the second quarter was 20 now 277 is safe on third down at seven arsalan one Thomas was on the coverage of record but it's clean all the way and he efficient right on the play Don Rutgers had a little a little lake problem he hasn't been able to run at full speed which is the reason we mentioned you might see a Willis Smith or John Smith or Willis Adam you can see right now he's oneonone sipes got the defense he wants the record can't outrun JT Thomas and if you get the right defense you still have to be at Lex he's the great comebacks go his career was over last year because of a blood disorder and you illness but JT Thomas is back and playing strong football for the Steelers and now the Browns will have to punt with two minutes left was a quarterback in rookie feature put up first down and Schoff said he may be an outstanding quarterback before a screw but when your putter can throw the ball boy is that an edge it he hasn't shown it all year long that's the first girl he's made during the regular season right on the money and Cleveland keeps its drive alive so with two minutes left to play in the first half the Browns get it going down they're starting to mount another challenge looking to get back in this football game the first NFL completion for Johnny Yemen is a big one and we'll be back with the Browns of the 1st and 10 in a moment with John Brodie this is Don Ricky back in Cleveland Stadium two minutes left to play in the first half the Browns fell behind 27 nothing to the world champion Steelers now Cleveland scoring on a flash possession is driving again the Browns have the ball at the 34 yard line of Pittsburgh with two minutes to play in the half it's first in ten Cleveland to the right Reggie Rutgers wider left the last time the crowd tell you that daddy shell did a heck of a job of covering because Newsom did get 101 with shel Wagner was out of the plate completely and he stayed right with him okay everybody in the house knows he's going to throw but to who this one goes right down the field shells with a man for bayon covers them all away and then the bear Brian said is the best pass catcher we ever had in Alabama they asked Bear Bryant one time that they ever retired his number as a college players didn't know because I ordered it from when every week we all did that so we saw programs second down and ten for the sighs Brian Sipe cool man when he rounds up and she takes the graph catch Winston oneonone with a halfback you know it's really difficult people say hey if you're a linebacker you're a linebacker sure we know but he hasn't played the outside he's got to play it right now because Cole's hurt and they've got a couple other injuries to go with him he's the most experienced linebacker they have at this done and he's filling in he's doing the best he can but it's awful tough to cover an area that's what the Browns we're going to work out now he sees act Valentine goes are they going to try another man at that a rookie from East Carolina dealers have a mistake under coverage other side to be able to score they're getting people open well that time they had the proper call against the proper defense tiny shell had to watch this up all by himself however Newsome couldn't get loose size ended up having to throw the ball away and it's one thing to call a proper play it's another thing to be able to execute Chuck Noll going with a lot of people on his defensive line Dwight White number 78 is now in the game he is the right end has been in there Gary done the right tackle Joe Green the left tackle and Tom Beasley the left end 65 Rutgers goes out of the game now it's second down right look hey it's tough time when you had a 27 touchdown having a problem and Ozzie Newsome came across the middle and a tight end released to the weak side he scooted out behind the linebackers wheel watch him catch the ball and take it in and you can see my crew it gave him a fine block to help out fruits on the outside do some cuts behind him he just up ends Thomas samarium for six and so now the Browns are on the boat again with 1:35 left to play in the first half and they're looking for their 14th pointing that missed extra point by meThe fire but ultimately it is Drock nails it see if the Browns ever had all the points they should have this would be airtight Cleveland turns the game around and gets back in in the second quarter we'll be back with what has turned into a very exciting football game serviced by the National Football League go arena heating up here in Cleveland we still might be switching part of our network to Denver and San Diego they're still in a scoreless tie out at Mile High Stadium as the wind gusts down on the playing field and blows the ball off the tee for Don Cochran 1:35 left to play in the first half Cleveland scoring on its last two possessions after missing earlier chances now trails the Steelers 27 to 14 and the impetus has turned around it's in the white church now this is very untypical of Pittsburgh Cleveland ballgames most of them are very lowscoring hardfought into trenches everybody's trying to control the ball this one the ball is up for grabs the Browse offensive line has really done a good job in the second quarter taken care of site they've given him time to throw and he has been there with a football he's been there for the last 10 or 12 games that he's turned into an outstanding quarterback this way Larry Anderson across the cab 45 yard line to the 47 yard line the Larry Anderson explosive kick returner brings the ball back nicely for the Steelers a 42 yard return and Bradshaw this dealer offense now has enough time to possibly get something else up Willa's adam goes down the tackle for Cleveland all the way out to the Steelers 47 yard line Bradshaw ever the great day six times has completed six bacon completion is down to the 42 yard line John Starwood came back at the football looked like a brown defensive back might have a play on it but the reception is made John Donne you can see that that Bradshaw knows the whole trend of momentum has changed they have to get back on the on the offense and they were starting to hold the ball trying to control it almost just kind of eaten up the clock with a little over two quarters to play now they know they're back at a ballgame they've got to go on attacker Sam Rutigliano starting to feel a little better about this tonight on NBC Disney's wonderful world we coming up at 7 o'clock Eastern Time our two of the $1,000,000 duck starring Dean Jones at 8 o'clock it is a big event great first intense dealer a draw play and Thorton doesn't get much shirk playing a brilliant again fights off the block got a piece of Sidney Thornton and the clock continues to run it's going to wind down to a minute now to stealers going into formation without a huddle that is the game clock you see winding down second and ten ratshot pixel update that triggers it to Rocky Bleier to the 30yard line very near to a first down he might have a job excellent pattern all away Bradshaw just kind of looked people off let flyer come out laid out of the backfield there were no linebackers in the area picked up a first down and they're on the move with 46 seconds left now he had the conversation on the sideline as Bradshaw comes over to talk to Chuck Noll there's dick hope the longtime running back with the Steelers what do they sing I don't really think there's any wisdom going on it's just they're trying to discuss games on how to handle their timeouts what plays they feel they might call at this time they're probably two or three thoughts that he'll go out there with I think Chuck Noll is an outstanding offensive coach see the light sign on us now very cold afternoon here in Cleveland temperature dropping in the wind is picking up in intensity right here we see the Steelers they've done offense in rushing north in passing seventh overall Cleveland grading out as the best defensive team at this point jolly Halle COEs out Dave graph comes into play linebacker wind is really gusting now it's very unusual wind you can tell which way it's going to come at you from before well I don't think it's with it's not with Pittsburgh if there is any wind at all it's going the other way third down and a foot if they do try to pick up the first down which I think they will I really think they will they've still got get back on the ball let's get another play and that's what they were discussing I'm sure when I went in the side they break the huddle a gym let's go to the runner just what they do they go for the first down Thorton runs it down to the 25 yard line and also advances the ball the middle of the field 35 seconds left ball was tipped Zeta was up Nikki Sims was up Lucy gets credit for the tip ball because it was Sims lots of guys were wide open swinging out nice patterns being run by this dealer that's you know John that's really about the only way you can protect them against the back coming out of the backfield late after the linebacker has moved into his drop area you've got to depend on your linemen to get their hands up and get a piece of the ball they'll work that time for the Browns after the first incompletion of the day for Terry Bradshaw 26 seconds left to play first half score Cleveland trailing Pittsburgh 2714 trying to stave off the Pittsburgh Steelers they've in short Deveny Cunningham they're down in ten it'll be a tough field goal if the Steelers don't advance the ball on this play this third down ten play coming up bar the rookie place kicker from Penn State was having a lot of problems in pregame in the yesterday's practice get it through here with the win and he's going a little bit against it at this time it's difficult for the college kickers to come into the NFL because in college did you may know they used a kicking t on field goals next two points and the pros you pick it off the dirt the fuzzy concrete that's our third and he throws the ball away do not people up Carla Jim Connie is the man who makes that to Elton honey was sitting there making sure of the play between the tackles the rush and fresh off and I don't even think he saw the ball being released by Terry Mike st. Clair says he of course the potential grounding is that it lost it down now the field goal attempt we'll be a 43yard it does across the bar looked like it was going to come up short so Matt fire delivers a real glutton field goal for the Pittsburgh Steelers they extend their lead to 32 14 and it's a it's a good distance it's a long 42 yards time the win almost stopped it but it dropped over the crossbar of our 10 feet in the air and that bar hits an important field goal for the Pittsburgh Steelers and with 11 seconds left to play in the first half it is the Steelers 30 the Browns 14 and Chuck Nelson let's get it out here and get after these guys ready to kick off this mat bar many of our stations around the NBC network will be going to news and halftime very briefly after this kickoff we're gonna update the other stores that bar he's five seven with cleats to beg but he's not afraid let me ask those big guys I'll wacom boy Anthony Anderson finally knocks him down John Johnny just escaped it a collision between you can see the two Pittsburgh Steelers who are in on the play Larry Anderson's getting up very slow take a look this is Zack Valentine coming down on to play eNOS Smith runs right through a collision just barely got through it we don't see it on the screen but it happened so while a Pittsburgh player is down we'll review the scores around the rest of the National Football League San Diego and Denver at halftime have not scored it is a nothing nothing tied at Mile High Stadium la has now moved out to a 21 to 7 lead over the Saints at the Superdome and even as we speak the Rams get the end zone again 28 7 five seconds left to play in the first half here at Cleveland Stadium the Browns have the ball as an injured Steeler is attended to all right Tom graves rookie linebacker from Michigan State all right second quarter score Baltimore leading the Jets as they did in the first quarter it is Kenda nothing Colts they need to win so badly they say marchibroda could be gone if the coast did not come out on tap this week they go into the game Owen five Giants won their first game today maybe the previously unbeaten Tampa Bay Buccaneers Dallas Minnesota in the second third quarter twenty three to ten Brian Sipe takes a look long last play of the half well rejected Mike he's not done yet looking for blockers look into lateral who know what's above this point right now Wagner diction across the 45 and gets to the 47 so the first half ends",

moving the ball in the air effectively if they continue to do this we've got a ball game left right now let's go to Brian Campbell in New York Sunday number six has been a Sunday of upset and confrontation upset for that man John McCain coach the Tampa Bay Buccaneers because of this man Billy Taylor for the Giants he rushed for 100 yards they scored two touchdowns the Giants post their first victory of the season Tampa Bay not from the ranks of the unbeaten after six weeks the NFL has no unbeaten teams in Cleveland two teams battling off the first place the Steelers in the Browns Franco Harris having a big afternoon 70 yards on this play the Steelers rushing to a big early lead they lead at halftime by 16 points hello again everyone Bryant Gumbel and Mike Adamle welcoming you back to NFL 79 let's try to get you caught up very quickly on what's happening this Sunday Kansas City Chiefs very young very good ballclub they win their third straight they beat the Bengals 10 7 Cincinnati still winless in the Meadowlands in New York Giants that was the first start for a quarterback Phil Simms it didn't matter he didn't have a very good day 37 yards he handed off to Billy Taylor 144 yards 2 TDs Washington a loose in a Philadelphia today 28 17 that phyto Wilber Montgomery scored three touchdowns New England over Detroit 24 17 they're having problems again that it wasn't until a Tom Owen touchdown pass to Don Calhoun that they went ahead sweet Walter Payton 39 carries 155 yards the Bears turned back the bills and shut him out 7eleven Atlanta a big winner over the puzzling Green Bay Packers 25 2 7 3 Tim as any field goal is the difference in that one you think they're puzzling figure this without the Oilers drop to 4 and 2 the Cardinals beat him 24 to 17 that's an upset quite an offensive showing in the Municipal Stadium in Cleveland Ohio 32 14 at the score Terry Bradshaw three touchdown passes Brian sight we're not sure what the Broncos and chargers are doing 3rd quarter there's no score is that possible I don't know but halftime in Los Angeles or in New Orleans 28 7 wendyl Tyler touchdown runs to Pat Haden touchdown passes Jets Baltimore Colts seeking their first win out in front 10 3 and Dallas Minnesota up in Bloomington 23 10 at halftime and Seattle leading San Francisco right now 147 remember the 49ers still without a win this year we've got a second half football to come we'll get to it after this commercial break well hello hello Cleveland is we're back now Cleveland stadium Don crookie with John Brodie ready for the third quarter the Steelers hit them out onto the field Brian Sipe has done a good job in the blowing wind Gary Bradshaw has been even better take a look at statistically how this game breaks down at the Steelers in the lead 30 to 14 Terry Bradshaw had such an outstanding first half everything came so easy for him at one time he was 7 for 7 and he thrown three touchdowns now it's just been real easy for Pittsburgh then they had to get back and do some play in toward the end of the first half he took him down for another threepointer at a 16 point lead I don't really think those statistics are indicative of the difference in the score I mean the brown sacks we had the ball longer than did Pittsburgh they scored so quick when they got it they didn't have it much parts only great 32:14 is the score Lyle Alzado getting taped up getting cleaned up they're going to put a new hoof on there off track today little muddy down in the playing field he's been a big addition since he's come over from Denver done and that he's had a lot to do with these guys coordinating their defense last week he couldn't play it it hurt him badly I think today he's playing very well but their defense has been a little suspect yes you go with whatever works they start using different shoes this of course is a natural grass field a good part of a natural mud after heavy rains of course the baseball infield is still down as the Indians just got done Steelers will be receiving to start the third quarter and teeing up the ball is down drop the swirling gusting wind temperature must be somewhere in the mid 40s now the Joe factor from this wind brings it below that so we're ready to go in the third quarter as the Pittsburgh Steelers after leading 27 to nothing I have a 32 14 lead a mow matter was with the ground field goal just before the end of the half up back takes it for me back here with Obama's Greg booked on the rookie number one draft choice he's a power back out of Baylor and he gets the ball across the 35 yard line out to about the 39 tackle by Randy rich now sir as we break down the Pittsburgh Steelers on offense you see the Cleveland Brown defensive unit come out the quarterback is Bradshaw wide receivers 82 star worth of 86 Jim Smith Benny Cunningham 89 is down at tight end he's been alternating with Randy Grossman setbacks are Sydney Thornton and Franco Harris they folk pin in the end zone today for Pittsburgh Mullins and Davis regards probe and Larry Brown the tackle isn't here come start running out hired he gets out across the 40 yard line Mike st. Clair 74 is it left in for the brown Nicky Sims and Jerry shirt the Jackals Lyle Alzado the end Oh Jackson that's the line in the middle Matthew is called on the outside backers both of them Davis at the corners gotten Gardner the safe easy second down and five Kira he gets close but not enough for the first down they do turn football games around for sure third and less than two yards for our Pittsburgh Thank You Harris who you remember took one the distance on a third and short yardage remember he went 71 yards for a touchdown Sam Davis blocking well for the Pittsburgh Steelers Sam Davis's block well for a long long time he's been their offensive captain he's their workhorse would you stand somebody up at the line of scrimmage you're doing your job you've won the collision ball against the Cleveland Browns is declined as the first down in the carry as the bottles advance down now to the 47 yard line of Cleveland the Steelers break the huddle 1st down and 10 13:25 to play in the third run to the 45yard line and he is knocked down by the middle linebacker Robert Jackson short gain on the play it's going to be second down in a long e for this dealers 45 yard line of Cleveland Bradshaw coming out with a conservative offense he can afford that with a 30 or 14 lead well they're doing right now what they thought they could do when they started the ballgame they thought they could trap Cleveland their heads come off the field a little bit and Pittsburgh for the trapping team since they since toe got there they've been doing it pretty well betcha plate bacon looks wrong football out enjoy how did John Stallworth browns getting back real well in that zone coverage Matthews the outside linebacker on the right side takes a very quick drop and you don't done Robert Jackson was was in the lane very swiftly that time he's been playing the run much better this week than he did last week against Houston I think one game really helps a guy get his feet on the ground and I think at the middle he's played very well you can see there's quite a congestion in there little playaction pass nobody gets to Terry but nobody gets open either now the Browns going to extra defensive backs the deepfried corn bomb yard line the corner bag Ron Bolton was with him stride for stride they hit the infield the dirt the footing went and both felt very fortunate get away without a touchdown on that or an interference penalty dan telev Kim Smith is disappointed or he's hurt apparently he's injured he's hurt he's holding his left knee Jim Smith the wide receiver secondyear University of Michigan is down at the 2 yard line where he lost the ball and that will bring up fourth down the Steeler punters that will watch it again here John he's got good time offensive line give him plenty of protection all day long oh but he's really come close to Terry he throws the ball pretty well I think Smith will come up with two out of three of those right now Jim Smith is down though he is being attended to he's been playing hurt he's in a hamstring injury I think that one was I think he got the wind backed out that's good he's okay you might still write in the football I got taken out for play Webster is the punch snapper there is the deep man Ozzie Newsome is back to return punch now for the Cleveland only got part of that one it goes out of bounds at the 30 and so the Browns come out with relatively good field position after this commercial we'll be switching to San Diego and Denver for an update on that very close football game in the AFC West at the moment it is Denver 7 San Diego nothing there's a timeout the field here at Cleveland with the Steelers in the lead 32:14 they're airing out the laundry here in Cleveland the crowds fans waving the Browns bags and the Steeler fans with the Terrible Towels that got it all going here Browns had the ball for the first time in the third quarter Brian Sipe drops to throw deep drop he's got a man but he sings it as Calvin Hill ran into one of the officials you barely did the official I was looking at the line play he got himself fixated to where he couldn't get out of the way of Calvin effectively busted up the pattern ran into the umpire Pat harder that was a good old fullback he has to get it he has to get a little active every week say that umpire he's got a standin tall against right in the middle of that defense referee can play off to all be in front of him at second down and 10 for the Cleveland Brown fall at the brown 30yard line despite gives up the running through it doesn't get much at all of Steeler defense suits the gap Jack ham as projected as a man soon to go or one day to go to Canton Ohio in the Hall of Fame he's that good made the stop at the left linebacker Gary Dunn number 67 was also on the stop looking at the Steelers on defense they've been aligning different people Zack Valentine is now started a third ported outside linebacker and go Dennis Winston also in the game Leo Miller comes in the Cleveland backfield Rickey features in as a wide receiver site takes the drop looks he left her loop knocked down by Dennis Winston he was beaten earlier you remember by Calvin Hill this time Winston is on the play yeah he moved into the middle where he's very comfortable he had Lambert were playing inside middle linebackers both of them at the same time and he was he took a fine angle the part was a little bit under throat and that's all Winston dated so Johnny Evans is in to punt I don't think we'll see him throw the bottles he did the first time when he had that nice completion to keep a Browns drive alive Evans a good flowing putter because he was a good throw on quarterback at North Carolina State this is this is the throw that could have kept a drive alive would have put them back on the boob they move very effectively in the first half just a poorly thrown ball really kept from getting a first down there's this step wellhit endoverend hit fairly deep he bears a footballing neo bill is the tictock say the wind kamut just took John Brody's hat store carried everything 40 we'll be back in a moment Pittsburgh Steelers come out the crowd starts up here at Cleveland 80,000 on hand at Cleveland stadium Steelers leading the game 32:14 Bradshaw most valuable player in the league last year in most polls gives off the cart and Sydney Carton who's in the game averaging five point six yards a rush is shut down quickly by the Cleveland defense Nicky Sims number 78 was on the staff Waveland that tighten it up a little bit that they've been very tough against the road in the past two or three series joining us in the booth is one of NBC's new football commentators Mike Lucci the former up for a middle linebacker for the Detroit Lions I helped him get him some votes every time he was going a little bad I threw him a couple second down and eight running to the daughters Franco Harris he gets it after the 40 yard line and Franco Harris is knocked down Charlie Hall 59 and Clay Matthews 57 the outside backers for the Browns around the stop Franco Harris got 71 of those in one fell swoop crash down okay just a straightahead block they've got a combination between between shirt and all's a toe that's their responsibility did it very well third down and three here's a pitch back to Franco Harris who has his first hundred yard game of this season but he has as many in fact he's going to equal oh gee a Simpsons and Jim Brown is the only back to get eight thousand yards in his first eight years in the National Football League Lyle Alzado and Tom Darden we're on the stuff is only his 31st 100yard game boy he's listed at 6 to 225 but if he is in 6 for 235 he's not a found producer you could get out here ran into him in advertently in the end zone during a Steeler workout right now it is dark in Cleveland ominous skies overhead gusting winds continue as the Steelers break the huddle under the lights play in the third quarter recho stepstep funds first down Harris goes wide rings the corner and he's knocked out of the 48 yard line he got five Oliver Davis not too big made the play coming up from the corner number 21 Oliver Davis and Ron bolt at the corners Clarence got in Tom Darden the safeties Paul Jackson and nephews back the line for Cleveland the second down and five now for the Pittsburgh Steelers ball at their 47 yard line Sydney Carton turns the corner turns a sail he's not done yet he is a practice man in Northeast Louisiana crashes down inside the 25 yard and the Steelers are challenging again well as we watched earlier we saw he picked up 58 yards on 13 carries pretty fair day he's been just about par for him he's been doing a a lot for this team coming up with big plays when they need it most this time he picks up 22 27 yards when it looks like the defense has stopped the play did Mike Webster makes his first block and isn't done yet he's going to stay right with it well Mike is a very active guy when your center is as active as Mike is it allows you to do a lot of things offensive ly that sometimes you can't do he's got good side for three little Joey lay there Mike and pump that iron they've got three guys on the Steelers cold and makes it into the end zone for yet another Pittsburgh touchdown at 36 to 14 Steelers what pittsburgh is known most for their ability to trap right at the heart of the defense right over the tackle with when Eric broke the line of scrimmage he was in the end zone I mean everything was cleaned out there was nothing left excellent trap clock bike fight Davis and the center Webster where Franco gets out there it's all over folks Franco Harris with his first 100 yard day of the season he might have his first 200 yard day before this one's over Barr tries the extra point it's good let's watch Franco tear it up from ground level it's the second play of the day that has has gone so cleanly so smooth you can see Sam Davis comes out just handles the defensive tackle before he can come in to close the flight Aaron scans the end of the secondary and the case is closed touchdown Steelers into the end zone we're going to have more it is 37 to 14 the Steelers leading around honey how long you gonna be in there in a minute these bathroom walls really needed help so I got a new flair squares just put them in water and put them up just finishing up where squares are easy to handle even in hard places we're back and ready to play football once again at Cleveland the Steelers ready to kick it off they leave the game 37 to 14 here is the kick down field at Dino Hall of the brown he's to the 20 Deno harlot finally swept under by away with those big Steelers and about the 33 yard line Randi Grossman was down along with Valentine Steelers stack up in touchdowns this year they've been in the end zone 18 times pretty good balance but you notice you notice they're passing stats are just getting a little higher and a little higher and a little higher when they need to Theriot get it done there's a tremendous football game going on at Mile High Stadium Denver Colorado we'll be updating that game with a report very shortly and we may be picking up some of the coverage for you as right now it is first intended Cleveland Brown 813 to play third quarter with us Adams at the beginning as a wide receiver we can pass goes to Adams he can run up to the 38 yard line close to five yards the Starling runners for the Steelers John Harrison Thornton have 219 yards between them you can credit a lot of that to the backs but a lot of it to the guards because they were given they were given a break at the point of attack right at the line of scrimmage and that's that's true for about 130 of it the Browns break the huddle a second down and five coming up now for Cleveland at the Browns 38 yard line throw it turns up field so it runs ahead fro first down and gets the ball to the 47 yard line Lambert knocked him down Jack Lambert the middle linebacker Mike Bruins getting a lot of work here today for the Cleveland Brown Joe green of attack dog Greenwood defense event along with bright white light swings it out here's some big people hit and hit on out there who show cards in those deals there's no way to go but head along into each other now those look like very simple patterns but actually crew would read a very nice pattern he stayed away games type a good target to hit type look down the field long enough so that he didn't tip off where he was coming with the ball it made it a tough reaction for them for the linebackers to come back and make the play picked up six and boarded they make the play second down and I take the drop wind is swirling Brian Sipe Lofton a man is open Rutgers caught one earlier for a touchdown brings the Browns all the way down to the 20yard line of the Pittsburgh Steelers JA was an excellent throw and an excellent adjustment by Rutger I mean when he got by promise he was looking for the ball right now and it was a double coverage they int they shorten log him and he just beat the coverage Brian threw it at the right time and put it the right place I'll show it short and long in a minute but it worked Jordan Lowell it means one goes up gets him and the other stays back fella if he couldn't get over there fast he gets short it a little bit now first down Browns his fight looks in the end zone here's the Rocky Ozzie Newsome had it lost it when he hit the dirt boy they have put a real responsibility done on tiny shell all day long he comes right up on that night and he's taking him all over the field and it figures hey I better get him right now get what I can because a little later it's going to be tough and he's been following them all over the football field very effectively once again we looked around level as you see Newsome grab it now this is an earlier one to Rutger this one went for the first down to 20 so now the ball is at the 20 it's going to be second down we pause briefly for station identification this is the NBC television network this is WIC TV your new spirit station in Pittsburgh it will be third down and ten per Cleveland you know what hook the defense for Pittsburgh those quarterbacks I have been put in a bind they forced them to play mantoman all over the field trying to give their linebackers a little more help and in doing so it really puts a burden on both blunt and Thomas so far they've been up to it they have they played good football blitz comes those corners aren't single coverage well not even the Blitz so much done as it is they're useful they're trying to keep their safeties in to help their linebackers because they've been picking out the linebackers Winston's play the position he's not too familiar with this is their way of Baelor third down and ten now he swings he hits Logan and Dave Logan is down inside the 15 it'll be well short of a first down and it'll bring up fourth down Donny shale playing up tight watch him cover Newson okay and he's got it tough he's got a tough job to do he makes a fine play on booster pushes them to the outside and then recovers to come up and make the tackle on Logan gemma is one of those real finds free agent makes allpro that was Dave Logan's first catch of the day inside the Pittsburgh 15yard line sites standing it against the fit rotten Calvin Hill was not picked up coming out of the backfield well there was a blitz Calvin alfayed he got out there was nobody on him when he did so sighs just had to lay the ball over to him as he did I don't know if there was a man responsible for him but my gut reaction is that they said poor men when they thought they could pick up at the quarterback as a result he's run it all alone for six years Calvin Hill turning up the sideline and into the end zone he go now drops will try the point after and resilient now sees his team put up his third touchdown of the game good old bye Dave I snap a cross stick is up and through but there are two penalty markers down the attendance over 81,000 for this game the biggest ball yard the NFL may fill it a lot of weeks always when the pittsburgh steelers come to town normally they refer to the 12th man Brian Sipe John has now completed 15 of 28 for 213 yards and three touchdowns according to Joe Costanza who keeps the numbers for us and very well you normally that's enough to get you a win now he only needs 17 more points and that may not do it here's the high spinning picked off by drop moving up on the ball is drop moving up on the ball is Anderson he's at his 10yard line across the 30 up to the 33yard line I talked about the players getting bigger but there's anything that stands out you notice more and more down as the speed in this game was just like a trackday please pick up return when you're talking about when you're talking about speed you talk about Gregg horn so it's a kid from Baylor he's in the ball game now we haven't seen him carry the ball very much I think you'll see him put his hands on and do some lifts doubt the backup quarterback for Youngstown State and Cruz X that just beats the card he can play though Rozalia were speed records popcorn is in the game thank God with them they go to hostel takes a couple of shots advances the bun up to the 35 yard line to the 36th of any given and the clock runs four minutes and 14 seconds left to play in the third quarter Steelers 37 Cleveland 21 81,000 to 6 so is the official attendance 15,000 here from Pittsburgh we'll play that music at four o'clock in the morning his arms just get rid of it I was tip Waveland had a play on it goes into incompletion shirk was on Bradshaw and I'll tell you what Clay Matthews was all over hostile Terry would like to have gone to him but he couldn't beat the linebacker Jerry shirt having a fine year keep it up with Lyle Alzado on the right side they play a little game he finally does get to Terry and Terry can't find anybody open he's not had a sack in the game yet around outcomes in the game along with Ricky Jones as they pull the middle back here six defensive backs on a Thursday he went to another play at the line of scrimmage did he get the ball I think he got the ball but he went out of battle so is it incomplete pass and the Steelers now with what Cevallos Lucien drops back for the Cleveland Brown with 339 left to play in the third quarter Newsom's Danny beckons down his 25yard line cope with will hit the ball somewhere around the 28th there is a dinner soon knuckle ball downfield 33 32 so the big fight October 20th on NBC sports world Ryan sighs drop desirable applause so there's another challenge on that's an unbelievable crow I don't even think he should have thrown the ball because there were four people sitting in the area ready to break it up or intercept it it was thrown so perfectly it just kind of hit boost of right on the dead run look at this Lambert is back in a great drop Donnie shelf comes over Wagner comes over and almost picked it off it's a big place to kind of play Cleveland needs to get back in this ball game thereabouts 37:21 first down and ten Cleveland 30yard line of the Pittsburgh Steelers from behind through it is inside the 25yard line they are and here's another problem Dennis Winston is going off the field which necessitates a replacement in an area where they can least afford it well they're going to go with a rookie Tom graves comes in the game number 50 as tight Council's his team in the offensive hi Linda Cleveland Brown second down and five is coming up for Cleveland Rutgers Logan who's that wider goes with Jade go to the right and the carry is down inside the 25yard line Calvin Hill got up to about the 23 Gary Dunn knocked him down the third down and about two yards to go for the first down job very big drive they can say now have enough time to where they can run it or throw it they put themselves in a position where they have to get it in on this driver even three points puts it within two touchdowns on the board this game there could be a lot more 125 third down and three for Cleveland big play inside the Steeler 25 he'll did not get there and so the Browns have to go to the fourth down play they will go from scrimmage I'm fourth down there was excellent little loss on the play Bob will be spotted about the 23 going to be 4th and 3 you notice Jack ham was in there on the tackle yes threw it help us down and 3 for Cleveland 6 played for the brown sigh pros out he runs through he picks a hard shot he got down to where he had to go the 20 now to deal where they spot the ball I'm thinking well it's really close dealers think they stopped him that we don't know let me see that James come out and the measurement name he really was stood up hard on a driving tackle Wagner hit him engraves number 50 also got him he slipped just a little bit coming out he tried to make the make a move up a little quicker and it just cost him the 6 inches he was short so they're Steelers fist raised in the air go off the field the defense holding on fourth down and Pittsburgh takes over the ball 32 seconds left to play now the 3rd quarter take another look at it you see just kind of slip when he tried to cut upfield short you don't want the quarterback thinking those shots on the shoulder using the quarter first in game history left shot selection goes through today and Harrah's runs the ball out across the 25 yard line before Nicky Sims knocks them down next Sunday there was an outstanding line of exciting NFL action on NBC first at 12:30 Eastern Time NFL 79 with Bryant Gumbel and Mike Adamle and a look at Wild West football Canadian style then most of the country will see the big enter conference matchup between the Patriots and the Bears other key games include Buffalo at Miami the Seahawks and the explosive San Diego Chargers Denver versus Kansas City a team is now fourth to ever win today the game in your area and now the third quarter comes to an end here at Cleveland with us to the ball I think a lot of people don't realize I in the wind harness to a wildcat leaving the rest of the world so you go for it making the most of now from the life you live to the fair you drink and since 1849 the beer that makes the most out of life the reef Franco Harris having a big day and the US Olympian getting set for a big summer here is bread job wide receiver screen he gets ahead to about the 29 yard line he'll be short of the first down at a second and four play here's that address again you can send your next to the funeral contribution yell for American Olympic athletes to u.s. Olympics post office box 1980 T Cathedral Station Boston Massachusetts Oh 201 1 8 Franco Harris as we mentioned his is 31st 100yard game Oh Jason Furness here had 42 so far Jim Brown the alltime leader played nine years see you got by you see a short yardage situation you've got everybody committed filling a hole they put a break for the third time today right in the middle of the defense what you do that the back is wall gone Grossman coming over there's nobody is pursued what you break the line of scrimmage you've gone it's coming a better time for Rockies have a little trouble getting back in the lineup because Cindy Thornton is playing so well it's really good rushing in originated me he's got a pretty good Russian average everyday Rocky Bleier the longest runs from scrimmage and his pro career and 21 so the rock busted one loose for the Pittsburgh Steelers popular guy on the to keep senator rocky says yeah but all that longest Russia history Rocky Bleier takes it into the end zone and we'll be back at Cleveland stadium with Lora this Pittsburgh this is Don quickie with John Brodie and the kickoff is returned by Dino Hall now for reporting that exciting game in Denver between the Chargers and the Broncos here's Sam Dover now you own Cleveland and you in Pittsburgh we're going to stay right here at Mile High at there at Mile High Stadium part of our network where Cleveland staying when last we look and it is 44 to 21 Rocky Bleier went the distance from seventy to seventy yards out longest run of his career Ryan site dumps it off threw it has and he's knocked out of bounds at about the 37 yard line stopping the clock with 1348 to play we get 65 points up so far John how many more do we get well there's no telling right now every time every time Pittsburgh gets the ball something good has happened for them they've been able to break big plays how many pens have you ever seen a football team run from the line of scrimmage 70 in 71 yards I've been watching Pittsburgh a long time I have not seen them run one play that far and they've got two of those today their offensive line would have to be credited they've just knock some holes in there and giving it back to the opportunity to get out and go Steelers say they've only had one good performance this season today fight take a look we'll catch it in the crowd takes it at the 49 yard line cutting back he's knocked down at about the 48 it'll be a first down for the Cleveland Browns Donnie shell finally knocked him down Pittsburgh has over 300 yards rushing John and they're averaging a carry this is unbelievable fifteen point three yards they'll get you there how sweet it is the quarterback can be brilliant you know Cleveland has had a very good day on pensively it's just they can't keep baiting pretty good shape in 21 so I pick you up Mike Wagner picks it off the Steelers own coverage closed in on the and Mike Wagner picked it off cybers intercepted for the third time remember when Ozzie Newsome went right down the stable drive before we mentioned that that's a very tough patch to hit and you're not going to pull Mike Wagner more than once or today he's already got his one charted up and Wagner's just been phaeton him hoping this play will come back he's got the ball all the way take a look yep he sure does so Mike Wagner takes the ball the free safety back there playing center field on a long pass yardage play mix it up and now right that they clean looking to run the clock 20 and up close to the 28 yard line updating some of the other scores around the league as Hawthorn carries Denver is leading San Diego in the fourth quarter a big game in the AFC West LA continues to lead the Saints in New Orleans 28 to 10 now the Jets have scored but Baltimore still holding on to a 106 lead as the Baltimore Koch look for their first win of this season Dallas a 510 over the Vikings fourth quarter he does not go down easily runs the ball right into the heart of the Cleveland defense gets the ball ahead and advances it close to the 35 yard line a pickup of five yards on the play you're watching a running back Greg Holland that you may see an awful lot of in the future at Pittsburgh number one draft choice big 220 pounds lots of speed and they really just haven't had an opportunity to insertive in the lineup big backs are so fast break away scat back when he got the 200 and it lost it Lorenz Johnson would the fool everybody like he's got an interception but if you get it on the one hop well you know poptart thought he was going to pick the ball off however he came up there and fell down a lot board almost picked it rail off there probably is a lot of speculation right now you notice the Bradshaw is in the ballgame they've got a 23 point lead they've got 12 minutes to play in the fourth quarter it's the philosophy of Chuck Noll there you start the ballgame and you finish it I agree with it because you can't get a lot of conversation on it if you put another quarterback in these guys they have a good day the first time you're a little off they start yelling for if it really is my opinion their point here's a black Paul Grossman was near to it st. Claire appeared to tip it Mike st. Claire the left hand number 74 that's how the dealer offenses scored on the top line how their defense has given up points in the fourth quarter you don't beat Pittsburgh now there are fourthquarter statistics through this game our fifty nine to seven is a about score the brown 7nothing first quarter was a big one for Pittsburgh 21 nothing Dino hollows back now to return the punt hope within the game gets it well downfield Nino takes it at his 20 look Tristan hill to the outside they got him for trippin cook with the only way you can stop it with borough colder right on it and leave marker down signals against you right the stealer get in any way you can but that one is illegal what was 45 yards the return was 57 so Dino Hall who's replacing a great injured kick returner keep right as a big job and here's some more penalty yardage tacked on he's almost broke at three or four today and he's ten yards on first down let's watch Dino on the ice oh okay we mentioned several times he's come close to breaking him and what a team scored 44 points you're going to get a lot of special team work here he gets out around the wedge it formed for him you see he tries to cut to the inside of Colquitt when he did he got tripped you know Hall does a good job tight close to the end zone I'm okay the reception then we almost had an interception we had allowed out incomplete as he went to go to Calvin hill again we'll watch the trip again you'll see Hulk with the punter come in and yell with a leg alright we mentioned the wedge it just set up it just set up perfectly you see all those fellas over there didn't even have anybody to block by the time he got around it as he goes down the lane coke what's in a good position playing him all the way as he cuts inside it just sticks his leg out it's about the only play he had he'll take the 10 you can wrap them as best you can any way but you can't triple Anderson a little shaken up behind the play for the Steelers now the Browns are down close second down intense like takes a look he locked it in didn't complete flinging out in downfield was Reggie Rucker with 11:35 left to play in the game so right now it will be third down and ten coming up for Cleveland forced to pass because of the disparity in the score the Browns have come up with a lot of third and long yardage plays threeone he locks it into the end zone jakie Thomas goes up and it's an incomplete pass this it'll be 35 instead of third and 10 you can see Elsie tried to get a little jump usually the quarterback gets into some sort of rut by this time the ball game those defensive linemen all know what it is that time you've jumped just a little early since the Steelers got cookin in 1972 there is that bar Danelle jjohnny a dozen you get it quick kicking very down in complete Denis Winston was covering Calvin Hill on the play though it's an incomplete pass and it brings up another fourth down it'll be fourth down in five now as the Cleveland Browns work hard to get it back into the end zone as many points as Pittsburghers put on the board today 44 Cleveland has left three scoring opportunities failed one time when they're on the 2 yard line then they missed a field goal the last time on 4th and 3 they weren't able to keep their drive alive and now they've got it down here again so they haven't had any problem it just put some points on the board get an idea how good it is against the rest of the league starting today's site fires in the flat low and lost it and the foot down plate comes up short and so I'm fourth down at the Steelers hold and take over the ball leading the 44 to 21 with a lemon 19 way returning to Cleveland stadium in the moment with the Steelers and route to their fifth win of the year the way it stands to this point then new you in the game Steelers 44 the Browns 21 and Pittsburgh has the ball first in Kent the theory run free football those drunk crowd we've got it well Lawrence Johnson thinks that Cleveland does he put in a claim anyway got a lot of good NBC people bringing you this game we have six cameras here today three replay machine and a lot of other of equipment and one of the many find NBC technicians responsible for this is electronic maintenance man L Buckner so Allen everybody on the NBC crew our producer Larry Cirillo our director Ted Nathanson thank you once again and here we go again Hawthorne trying to get it get through on a trap play he does break it at the line of scrimmage a potato gets his hand on the ball as he does so he jams it loose to Cleveland's got a turnover the lights are on the temperature has dropped here at Cleveland gusting winds of sight look into the end Logan every time people want to quit night brings it back for some sort of 27:44 71 points on the board Steelers had only given up 71 of the previous five game all right here goes sign good excellent protection site didn't have this kind of protection last week against Justin and Logan made a fine move down the field look at Winston he can't he can't get on him Logan cuts underneath Bell plus he's kind of lost once he lets it get to it that quickly as he does suicide puts it right where it had to be thrown Dan Rutigliano Logan of Gary Collins with speed the extra point is up and good in Cleveland we've got a lotta way to go 1103 left to play Pittsburgh leading 44 to 28 Pittsburgh Steelers Bradshaw it's the steel there's still almost 11 minutes of play left recovered Jim Smith apparently touched the ball and the ball will be at the 45 yard line here it is knocked off with a little swipe with a football for the Cleveland brookie Joe on the one hop it hit a Cleveland up back type takes a look family marker down in the Pittsburgh secondary well let me tell you Brian Sipe just got rid of that ball before the lights went out white white was flying after if there's a penalty on the play right in the middle of the field Browns don't look too happy about it here's the call double file cold 63 offense holding 31 defense play goes over retail do it again well honey shall we mentioned he's been on him all day long on Ozzie Newsome you did the middle of the field you've got it's a oneonone situation now he goes with the play but he was holding on to him I guess it was ruled earlier before we could see it Ryan site B is just four more yards John for 300 yards day he also needs 17 boys so it'll be first down to ten now for the Cleveland Browns as well if they're 45 yard line here comes why to the right Piper took the hard hit from Dwight White Ozzie Newsome with the antenna receiver this wind has done a lot of things on the field it's amazing a well they've thrown in the cookie just see ciphers rather disappointed because that screen looks pretty well set up it's a timing situation with the tackle you have to get a little bit for at the defensive end then the Deacon got that time and still a lot of time left the 44:28 store site takes the drive Waveland forgot to quit how many times did they come back at home in the last 10 games it must have been three or four now if they come back today it's a miracle and they're playing the fifty Finch the National Football League but they are moving the ball on it okay Dave Logan we saw him just a little bit earlier catch a touchdown pass get him within 16 points runs the same pattern only pulls it up in the air well throw right at the spot of the boom picks up a first Logan would be your basic athlete and we've still got a lot of 9:52 play let me tell you sometime these balls are pretty easy to complete you can see the lanes the site has to throw in it's because Lauren cave Robin pool the linebackers are hurting it causes rookies to play linebacker Tom Perez may be an outstanding football later in his career but he's still young very difficult for him to start cutting off pattern the Logan has been the guy down the stretch incitements been there show him playfight looks lost it into the end zone I think that last beauty this is like the old days whoever gets the ball last with last advance looks like a highlight reel 300 site so far where the brown didn't score when they had a they add those then we'd really have some yeah you think back that's history the brown he has completed 22 for 351 yards and five touchdowns left to play so we've got a long way to go these guys will not buy that their beef excellent throw the only place that can be caught Logan plays the ball all away never really gave Mel Blount magenta don't you joined us late we've got a show going out at Cleveland the piss and there are some defect on the Brown move including keep rallying back in the game 44 to 35 go triple digits for boy this time now I know that's great witless Adam and there's Bentley Marquez also down on the play what a game against the sailors interesting what a ball game the other team comes back now you've got to get your crew preordered look at Chuck no boy he is unhappy about this kind of the best this awesome Steeler defense that has taken his team to three World Championship the cake hands up in the crowd close it I tell you Cleveland is playing football right now you think the offense scoring touchdowns doesn't pump the defense up they seem to be playing better right at this moment than they have all throughout the game this is Robert Jackson fill in the hole clock running 829 left and and similar 92 that's how Cleveland breaks down offensively and defensively scoring internetting points throughout the four quarters of play okay here we go another shot just like the what like the halfback looks at it Oh close fast here's a pitch back to Harris it looks like Franco Harris might hit the first down he had to get the both of the 16 yard line he knew right where he has to get it and he got it there a big play for the Pittsburgh Steelers as their lead has been cut to 9:44 to 35 7 minutes and 25 seconds left to play the clock is running here and play as we have had one Brian spices will survive Bradshaw gives off the Franco Harris chop through a gain of less than two yards and the clock run six minutes and 50 seconds to go John Brodie that was a big seven yard gain Harris picked up he's run one 471 today but that seven yards was for beating he's quiet at this crowd and he's giving his team a little room to operate with they want to control the clock really way first down and like on it'll be paired he got to the 20 it'll be third down at about seven jack Gregory came in number 81 amazed a stop on Franco Harris all right we look at the offensive the best of it all day long during this dr cleveland looks up to the past there's the big guys diggin in Gregory in it left third down seven what for a sealer first down a superb connection by the Steelers when the pressure is on what it all worth her patterns honest this pattern was run just as well as you can run it he got inside the defense when he did so it allowed Bradshaw to have a lot of room throwing it to the outside you notice what he's doing what he did throw it Stallworth has given him a lot of room and throw it in a lot of sidelines to work with he picks up the first down and it just quiet it down everybody to know the clock is running five minutes left to play now it's down to four 44 to 30 and a stealer Oh that chocos Tijeras giving him left unless Franco Harris has over 150 yards running the ball this game he got 71 and that one shot up the middle out of third and short yardage play when he took it into the end zone at that point it looked like a laugher for the Pittsburgh Steelers or 25 left to play at the initial stadium Cleveland Ohio this is dime tricky with John Brodie we have 4:14 left to play in the game it has been a holding you a 44:35 falling way behind keep rallying back and now they're trying to get the football back from the world champions Brian Sipe the Cleveland quarterback his own first five touchdowns in this game definitely his career and Pittsburgh has been up to the task because ninepoint lead and there was nine minutes to go in the ball game they've just run off about five and five plus of those Bradshaw brothers capable his own 6yard line after the 42 yard one fine throw an excellent rug by it's completed and he's down to the 45 yard line of Cleveland it's a first down Steelers he just hangs in there and fires it where he has to it is a very difficult thing once the team thinks that they have won a football game for a quarterback the whole team is kind of let down all of a sudden like frank O'Hara said even come out of the ball game okay and it looked like everything was well in control all of a sudden they've got a regroup Bradshaw identities big windy day here in the 40 shorten the big back who got a lot of yardage early but has been quieted by the stately ground defense as of late dives ahead to right now the Steelers are doing what they want to do motion that is control the clock with this running game 220 left to play Pittsburgh holding to a 44 35 lead with 213 to go that would seem to be a lot of points to be leaving a football game by in this league with two minutes left to play but this has not been a normal National Football League game the whole lot more points that was seven minutes ago and Cleveland hadn't had the ball back since since they would did score to get it to within nine bang and really this is the best driver we've seen all day and it's been it's been fine execution by Bradshaw to real fine runs by Franco Harris it's not over but it's looking pretty thin if you're a believer fan Cleveland has 351 yards passing Pittsburgh has 351 yards rushing everybody's getting their numbers up in this one and this game will decide the leader in the American Football Conference Central Division st. Louis Cardinals upset they huge dollars today New England beat Detroit 24 Anza City / Cincinnati 10 to 7 Chicago beef Buffalo 7nothing Atlanta over Green Bay 25 to 7 with an L 50 Washington 28 17 the New York Giants upset Tampa Bay 17 to 14 that's uh the therapist the Boeing 757 Red John never ceases to amaze me two minutes to go we've got a ninepoint lead he just comes on since thank you very much they could pick up 30 yards fires the ball now baby that's why he is as good as he is I mean you just have to be using with confidence to be able to do that at this time of the ballgame so we have a break in the action here in Cleveland stadium 153 left to play and now the Steelers are down close once again to back Stephanie wants to make sure everybody's got on the same page I think somebody said hey what's it on there so let's regroup and put this down inside the 10yard line he stops the clock had to get down inside the 5yard line I'm Sergeant finally knock him down remember this drive started on their own sing it's right with everybody yelling now they're on the other team five and nobody's saying a word here we call that third down play when Brad shot through the strike for the first down and the Steelers get to join they take over the line of scrimmage on this Drive and now at 148 left to play the clock stop dealers have the bar with the Browns four yard line next week the world champions go to Cincinnati ramsley back here at home to play the Washington Redskins 148 left to play pendulum occurred up by the grab somebody wasn't allowed to the face mask for still foul face mask on against people when you're trying to handle Franco Harris you grab anything you get time Franco six maybe he can get around the corner he got it by the head pretty clearly don't think that was clearly illegal the penalty stops the clock with 142 left to play the others will have the ball inside the 5yard line at about the three the players cloak on the sidelines and jackets cape when swirl has been all game long like the benefits that the D starting up the mess down to the goal line did he cross it no signal apparently he's going to be ruled down just short of the touchdown line another good trap block Davis Webster play Matthews hit him headon and Matthews a little slow getting up we've seen them break three of these at the line of scrimmage Matthews fills the hole very well that time but Thornton just does a great job of running it picks up three and a half Rock is running out down to 108 left to go and running for those of you who have just joined us due to the length of today's game we will join Disney's wonderful world part 2 of the million dollar duck right after this game dealers break the huddle at their leisure see the trap block Davis bully Webster doing a fine job at the point of attack they've got the ball on the 1yard and Norton touchdown Pittsburgh 94 yard drive took it just about eight sati present okay this map they have Davis again moving those taxes out let's take another look Webster seals off Davis comes in that's a big hole so there's a break in the accident that leaves we proudly this game 51 to 35 we're not over yet 36 seconds ago if you know scan everyone flying como reporting for NFL 79 in New York where 42 the Colts have managed the victory what you're seeing here is Bucky Bilt snow here current safety especially to preserve a bowl please that made it ten eight they punted the ball to the Jets but they ran off the clock Ted marchibroda scoops for the first time in six tries this week get themselves to victory let's go back to Cleveland joined dunk Ricky and John Logan back at Cleveland Dino Hall has just run back to Pittsburgh kickoff across the 25 yard line and out to the 30 the Wayne Roadrunner rookie made the hit although this is a very short yardage situation we've seen Pittsburgh break it at the point of attack several times during the day and it's the same exact play you see Sam Davis pull out he takes care of Robert Jackson and the hole is just too big nobody's closed it down they've broken seven or eight on this very like to thank our spotters John Besh Cole and Pete Hoffman and our statistician Joe Costanza and we have 31 seconds left to go at Cleveland it is a very unlikely score 51 to 35 the game up the middle the rounds go to the run mic through it carries across the 35 yard line and apparently that would be the final play of the game as Cleveland with lets the clock run down 17 seconds left to go they've not stopped it yet and apparently not going to trailing 51 to 35 so you see the final seconds tick away in a game that was really like a highlight reel more spectacular crazy to see and half of season Pittsburgh Steelers extend their record to five and one and they take over sole possession of first place in the AFC Central Division as today the Houston Oilers were upset by the st.

round draft pick a couple of years ago Wilbert Montgomery showing superstar form he's a genuine thousand yard rusher following number twenty s block that's Leroy Harris a former dolphin Montgomery's in the end zone Eagle top in front seven nothing in the second quarter again as Ron Jaworski going to the air and again it's will Burt Montgomery on the end of this touchdown pass we're teaming up in Philadelphia they go on to win a 28 to 17 that walks with the Cowboys and the NFC's East with five one record at Giants Stadium it was scheduled to be rookie quarterback Phil Simms day as the number one draft pick opened a quarterback for the winless diets against the undefeated Tampa Bay Buccaneers but it turned out to be this young man day Billy Taylor a fourthround draft pick last year out of Texas Tech ran for 144 yards for two touchdowns well runs like this he gained the most yards by a giant him 12 years and in the previous five games of this season Billy Taylor had managed only 48 yards 112 attempts he loved it 34 times yesterday that touchdown run put the Dan stops in front seven to nothing then in the second quarter with the diet's often thought 14 to nothing Tampa Bay is Doug Williams drops back and looks for Larry mucker number 87 Williams puts it on a line mucker gets the touchdown to make it 147 but the Giants go on to win 17 to 14 if they not Tampa Bay out of the undefeated ranks there are no undefeated teams in the NFL its World Series time it will open tomorrow night in Baltimore our ABC cameras will be there our Cosell was there today earlier and he talked with a couple of key participants in tomorrow night's action well caught these two gentlemen will take the national spotlight tomorrow the opposition pitches in the first World Series game in the year 1979 to my left Bruce Kison of the Pirates to my right Mike Flanagan the brilliant south fought the birds I begin with you Bruce you've been a remarkable September performer throughout your career an earned run average of about 120 three victories five or six defeats what is there that happens to you when cool weather to produce that well Howard I've been asked that many times and I don't really have a concrete answer for that it's just one of the intangible parts of the game that I have no logical explanation because I certainly would apply it April May June July and August if I if I knew the real reason there are a lot of possibilities we have we been in championship games throughout the history the Pirates as long as I've been with the club and they're meaningful games where maybe some of the other ball clubs had been eliminated from the pin it it just it's hard to explain I've searched for it but I'd be a liar if I came up to that real answer if you've had a problem my friend that's lodged in the middle finger of your pitching hand the blister now is that now there there is no blister there was a false statement in Pittsburgh an inaccurate statement I had tenders missed my finger there was tenderness but to say absolutely there's a blister there was no blister and I came I'd pitched two games in a row right kid I came back on three days rest and I just could use the rest after six innings Chuck Tanner decided that is a good time to go there was some sensitivity in the finger but now I'm ready to go healthy you realize what a tough cookie you've got to go again well the entire Baltimore ballclub is a tough love but of course or the Pirates all right let's turn to you Mike Mike how do you account this year for the even greatest success when you enjoyed a year ago well I think there's a couple of reasons one another years experience and I think another is picking up Scottie McGregor's changeup it just seemed to set up my other pitches I think basically I was a 2 pitch pitcher until July of this year and then all of a sudden I came up with four and just made made me get through the games when I had to struggle a little bit believe you you won't have the benefit of the designated hitter you'll be losing potential home runs from Aibileen Mae or Pat Kelly probably Kelly because a righthander Keeton will be starting how much will this militate against you and your club well I think it's going to make a little bit different it's gonna be strange tomorrow night for sure to walk up the batter's box after not going up there for three or four years it'll be a little adjustment in our part it'll be a pleasure to pitch to Brewster well I remember I pitched against the Pirates two Springs ago and get one hit in five innings and he got it how do you feel about the problem of facing people like singleton and Murray he has to worry about poor Karen Stargell but he's a southpaw yar the disadvantage well I think they both both proven the type of ball players and hitters they are face candy before when he played with Montreal Eddie Murray only faced him in spring training and of course spring training doesn't count it's not nobody as competitive but they're both both proven talents and it just remains to be seen should be a very interesting series nervous a little bit possibly but you know as soon as the game starts that takes care of itself nervous a little bit too but like Bruce said once you get out of the mound it's a thing we've done for a number of years now and that's home to us so we'll be going again tomorrow night good luck to you both we look for a great game a great series and now back to the Gipper the dander oh and Sir Francis in Oakland",

  "transcript": "good season various elements of one that's under 500 but Chuck you know nothing last year five wins this year seven they feel very solidly that they can be a contender within the next two years today a win would go a long way in that direction we're down to the fifth tiebreaker to decide who wins between Pittsburgh and Houston if the Oilers should beat the Eagles today in Pittsburgh did win Pittsburgh wins the division Ennio developments Pittsburgh does not win they kick down fear by the Steelers have taken by Keith across the 10yard line and the 20 Blake across the 35 yard line so the bills gets the good kick return something they've not had regularly throughout this season their kick returning has been poor it is one of the weak areas of the football team moody has been a very strong kick returner out of Syracuse as a punt return men primarily up until this year and there are the offenses set for the bill Joe Ferguson at quarterback Terry Miller and Mike Conger start as the runners Butler and Louis the wide receivers joechip the tight end in for it's first it came from 36 yard wide open Skinner he's looking he's got a man open his cherry pot we're butters across the 50 he's inside the 40 and Jerry Butler allpro quality as a rookie takes the ball down to the Steeler 37 yard line I think what you're seeing is what Chuck Knox thinks is his best opportunity to get ahead in this ball game his personality used to be run the ball throw the ball in passing situations he can go back to Buffalo if he attacks Pittsburgh that way you can see on the first play of the game that is not his philosophy he's going to have a go at it he's got two great wide receivers to go Butler a spectacular firstyear player from Clemson this threegame Tillis caught 46 balls now this season of the rookie its first 210 for the bills end up they go up the middle Terry Miller pins off he gets a hit for maybe nine yards but penalty markers come in off the play I think it's a facemask Donna we can't tell but looked to me like his head jerk Donny shale looked like the guy who went after him gel the strong safety is a tough customer Steelers have some bad news come to them this morning Jack ham they're off proline Becker will not play again this season he's out of this game he's out of the playoffs you'll not even make it to the Pro Bowl because of an ankle injury a face mask first down hey LC Greenwood number 68 the left defensive end to look at the Steeler defensive front Greenwood that big Joe green 75 in at 76 the bills are challenging in the opening moments of this game first intent of the pittsburgh 23 yard line end up hitting up the left side for not much room is mike collier of former Pittsburgh Steeler at a Morgan State a big back backs into the right side of the Pittsburgh defense the offensive blockers for Buffalo have been unable to spring the running game this season they're not quite sure why there's some good people in there Ken Jones the left tackles become one of the most consistent to good guards in McKenzie and dilemma lure the landlord consensus All Pro Willie Parker at center Devlin's the right tackles had some problems with penalty a gain of only two it's second down and eight now for Buffalo 22 yard line of the schoolers no score first quarter but the bills are challenging they're going to throw right now so they go to the tips back to Tyler as the Steelers back back into zone coverage entirely against the head down looked like Ferguson checked off news yelling some over to one of his wide receivers and it had it not been for Elsie Greenwood that play was long gone had a lot of people out in front of the runner green with just with his speed caught up in front of town Greenwood green done Vanna Zack that's the defensive front and we get some Buffalo Bills sneaking in there trying to be linebackers for Pittsburgh but Winston Lambert and Cola the guys who are in there for Pittsburgh Joe ship the tight end goes out looper come comes in so now the bills go to free ridership with the third down seven now they drop back Ferguson a third and seven takes a look knocks it down he's got a man it's brought down at the 12 yard line about the 13 now they're gonna spot a little farther back yeah it looked like it might be short of the first down his receiver made the play lupa cone but he was a little short of the first down so it's going to be fourth and inches those are gonna flag kick here looks like John well you do want to get points on the board when you have an opportunity and if you have an opportunity first very few people have scored anything on the Steelers in the first quarter getting any sort of a lead puts at least it puts it back on the Steelers so Nick Nick Amaya who's been a real fine for Buffalo coming in as a free agent sixteen for 17 inside the 39 yard line the set down whistle flow the kick is up it looks like it's right there but there were whistles delay a game is called against Buffalo so instead of a good field goal the bills will have to try it again instead of fourth than 1 that will be fourth and six and take Micka Meier just a bit farther back although he's still well within his range 36 yards is still a chip shot but once you've kicked one you'd like to have those twits on board Sonny lay five yards fourth down okay we're gonna have fourth down over once again interesting quote the other day from George Blanda John said inside the 30 he thinks that 90% of the field goal success is the holder you're a holder for 17 years it does help you get it down there we were quite a a black veil garland here comes daddy the clay we now see that play will girl look like there's a penalty marker down there was not it was a very alert play by Mike Malucci you were talking about the holder he puts the ball down and kicked just a little bit late and just a little bit low looks to me like that's Joe Greene he slipped underneath the block but Manucci alertly got out there or she'll might have run it in so the bills are stopped in now frank O'Hara corner ideas whacks by a rookie free safety Jeff Nixon out of Richmond who's playing some fine football the Bills have for all rookie players they had a good draft hazlit Nixon in the defense there's the offense for the Pittsburgh Steelers Bradshaw at quarterback iron Harris are his starting runners great pass catchers John Starr worth 66 balls he's caught already Lynn Swann the other flank is healthy again tight end Cunningham some changes in the offensive line I've got people hurt there Peters from Korsak new starters no I'm sad for Coleman Sam Davis a second down and eight Bradshaw goes to the right right back to Franco and Maris their big back from Penn State Mooney it's just 135 yards to pass Jim ten I become the third alltime leading rusher behind Jim Brown and OJ Simpson brings the ball out across the 35 to the 39 yard line defensively the bills go at the front three and this has been a tough defensive unit Ben Williams Mike Kadish Sherman white in fact in the last four games the bills about given up only one touchdown a game war linebackers in there for Buffalo it's third down and a long trade for Pittsburgh pleasure step 10 he lets her rip and feel it has broken up so the Steelers will have to punt the ball the Buffalo the build offense started out as the weak unit the team was scoring a lot of points early in the year now the offense has gone a little soft and the defense is one of the best Buffalo's put on the field the last ten years and in the last two ballgames their offense has has failed to score a touchdown they have to do something today in order to stay in the ball game with Pittsburgh their defense seems to be playing pretty steadily and I think they'll hold their own well Anne Willis and Keith mutia back deep for Buffalo there is the pittsburgh connor Craig Colt with's never had one Blackie's a to temp runner into the way very quickly one two and boom and he really unloaded Moody lets you take a hop and jump into the end zone Buffalo beneficiaries of a touchback although in hot pursuit was Anderson they almost got to the ball inside the five right now there's a break in the action here at Three Rivers Stadium we'll be back with a score the Steelers noting their bills nothing Ferguson took the bills right down the field their first possession row in the football that crunch by Colquitt it's done there was 61 yards longer to the season Nathan there is the bills try to go to the run Gary Miller it was an eleven hundred yard rush last season as a rookie he comes into this game with only 471 rushing the ball through 15 games 3.5 per carry you know time to me the indicative thing is that the three primary running backs for Buffalo are all under four yards of carry the three for Pittsburgh are all over four yards of carry I think that deals with the personality both teams throw the ball a lot but when they have to run Pittsburgh does a better job second down and nine now for the floor no score first quarter back and this show shot through the line Lambert starts mixing up with de Lima leer people would pay to see that one I think they already have paid to see it they'll see a lot of it throughout the rest of the afternoon Buffalo took the ball right down the field if you joined us late got in field goal range Nick Nick Mir drilled it right up and through but a delay of game called against the bill sets them back five yards negated the field goal the next one was blocked by Joe green three ball picked up by Donny shale and so there's no score on the board done if you ever noticed how when things seemed a little lackluster Jack Lambert seems to create a situation that gets everybody off the floor and into the ballgame they've looked a little lackluster in the first series of plays offensively they didn't move the ball I kind of think he sits back and says hey we got to get something going Chuck Noll in nineteen seventy two of the first year the Steelers ever made the playoffs he's had the most successful franchise in football the most wins and of course pre Super Bowl championship seven the buffalo bills bottled a 21yard line we wide receivers are in but count goes into John Lewis here's a family market really coming right not happy about something first thing you do is keep your helmet on though when they start swinging white alternates the defensive end here's the call from Fred Silva then I guess it was Ken Jones I'm number 72 the illegal used to the handsfree to fourthdown to help enjoy well a guy gets you know once a guy gets a reputation for holding a little bit the officials seemed to watch him very closely and that was a late call but I'm sure it was a right one now rusty Jackson's in the game to punt standing back at 7 yard line you'll get the ball away from about the 11 it's a down field and not very well it takes a funny hop up in the air and the ball is picked up and it's going to be returned by T Bell we're running back into a buzz saw he doesn't fair catch the ballast to the 44 yard line and Johnson was down to make the play so the Steelers with good field position go on offense for a second time first and 10 when we return green of the Steelers once said they'd call me Mean Joe green with that Lambert he still mean he didn't like himself there he is sit at the edge of the bench an NBC sports world with a salute to the champions coming up next Saturday at 4:00 Eastern Time now we go first and ten Franco Harris takes the ball up the middle miles advanced to about the 48 yard line a pickup on the play of three yards it's going to be second down and seven Terry Bradshaw a Woodlawn high school 340 fort Louisiana the greatest high school quarterback people say they've ever seen came from that high school is on the field he wears number 12 but it's not Bradshaw Joe Ferguson who followed him four years later broke every record Bradshaw said here's a handoff to blyer there's nothing there the bills close it down that big nose tackle kadish took on the top row center Mike Webster and the linebacker shot in to make the knocked down on Flyers having a good season averaging 4.8 yards a rush that was Joe Ferguson under a tag on the leg John I think he's got as much talent in his right arm as any quarterback in the game I think he's been the he's been the effect of a fourth defensive or a number of years I think their defense is now coming coming what it is of age and I think in the future you'll hear the batch Oh third down and seven for his feelers we'll see if Bradshaw is going to go it now he takes the deep drop he's got time he throws and the Barneses we excellent coverage Blaz they went to their a Star Wars aya park at child's Rome starting at the corners Nixon and Freeman the safeties and Tony Green comes in as a fifth defensive back that Shaw's saying coach that one didn't work sending in a good one I think we're getting a good indication of why people are scoring fewer and fewer points against Buffalo they're playing tight mantoman defense there and if they're down free lanlan are doing well at the line of scrimmage here's Colquitt spun is first with 61 yards this is a good one that forces Moody into a fair catch at his 16 yard line and so the bills going offense for a third time there's no score on the board folks championship is on the line in the Rose Bowl as Heisman Trophy winner Chows white of USC ranked third go against the number one Buckeyes of Ohio State and that night at 8 o'clock Eastern Time is unbeaten Florida State against Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl there's nothing there again Joe Green having an allpro season once again he's been to the Pro Bowl ten times or will be a ten time Pro Bowler as of January was on the staff along with LC Greenwood they're both 11year veterans but they're playing good football still vanna's that can done the right tackle on the right end l alternate with Vanessa and Dwight white six line and get regular playing time yard second out of nine the big rush on Ferguson's age are they worried he goes to a draw play about the 19 yard line playing pass all the way so Ferguson went to a draw and didn't get there well I think he hoped they were playing fast but buffalo has not shown that they'll throw the ball inside their own 20 I think if they elect not to throw it they'll be there all afternoon good point but the Steelers have got a great intercepting team also they got a great team well amber has six interceptions himself the middle linebacker he's tied for third the National Football League an interception to the linebacker go out understand a 10 third and seven first quarter the throw is complete the Frank Lewis who is quickly put down by yet another Pittsburgh golf pro Nell blunt 64 218 pounds he plays cornerback the penalty is going to go against Buffalo again in a 307 play the bills got cut back forming the pocket five minutes in 39 seconds left to play in the first quarter no score on the board in a game that Pittsburgh must win to take the AFC Central Division a situation they're discussing right now ban is that they could force a fourth down and one or they have their option to get them back they're in there in a hole where they where they would either have to throw or be inside their own 10yard line I think they'll take the penalty is Fredd silva often number 72 face man cleared out if they're going to tip them back down a face mask all against Ken Jones and the ball is going to be inside the 15yard line so it'll be third down and 12 is Chuck Knox sees his team in a hole early net down though on the scoreboard no score Baltimore's leading the Giants 7 nothing in the first quarter I think they're coming up well they're threatening the Blitz they're free they're strong saftey shell has four stacks himself before Buffalo goes to the run and gets ready to punt the ball buffalo playing a computerized football game they're playing percentages and it's awfully tough to gamble and win against the Pittsburgh Steelers it's all awful tough to win if you don't gamble that in my opinion but in your own end I think Knox is thinking is the specter of an interception could put this game the right the other way there's no doubt that that's his thing Jackson goes back inside the 5yard line tea Bella's back now is the deep safety alone safety for the Steelers takes his time didn't hit it very far tea bells going to run a fact that Buffalo he takes it from his 46 go straight ahead across the 50 and Theo bell moves the ball for the 48 yard line of the bill so again to the Steelers are possession is the best position inside a buffalo 50 we'll be back in a moment it won't be this week they're beaten by Kentucky but there go five basketball teams milk content for the national championship before it's over next Saturday at 2:00 Eastern common tendency swing pass first intent he's inside the 40 and down to the 38 yard line the Steelers get the big guy moving 250 pound tight end Benny Cunningham goes to crash and right at the Buffalo defenders for an 11yard gain this play looked as if it might go for a touchdown when Cunningham made the reception a little little playaction fake he holds the linebackers in the center of the field gets the ball out to Cunningham a three men in front of him Isiah Robertson forces the play in makes the tackle himself very fine play and that is the first complete pass of this football game for a branch on the Steelers and knavish study to move the ball they're down to the 38 yard line of Buffalo first intense Steelers no score third quarter that shotgun 67th pass of the year he was out of bounds Don he kind of kind of lazy and he's arguing with the official at this point but he lifted his leg just before he caught it never got both feet inbounds at least that's the way it looks the way we're watching again on tape all right let's see the ball takes a while getting there and puts it over the top though see he had his right foot lifted so he still has 66 receptions one short of Roy Jefferson's alltime club record of 67 Bradshaw figures he's got one right in the pudding comes up four not so now it's second down in ten 450 and the bills are there to get em Isaiah Robertson number 58 who came to the bills as all the bills fans now but a lot of others main after the Los Angeles Rams joining his old coach there Chuck knocks play well here he's played very well not as good as he did in Los Angeles we wide receivers in the game now on a star with on one side so they can't be devil covered here is the pitch up the middle at night play by charles rome 26 cornerback from north carolina central he does lead in and tip them all away berry on very few occasions will you ever see a defensive back in a position to knock the ball down when bradshaw throws that type of pass as he does so often the both Stallworth and swan they get down on the man they get 20 yards downfield start coming back he puts the ball low they take it out of the car by that time was just a great defensive play to stop him now fourth down and a long field goal attempt 252 yarder that's maybe all whooping team beating out people like move on shaman of Miami and Tony Franklin the Eagles and a dick is partially blocking it rolls down field and so buffalo is going to come out of this with the ball first and ten at the 35 yard line first kicks up side the 20th the line of scrimmage whether missed and so Matt Barr who's had a good season has been very hot lately comes off after his field goal attempt was blocked as one of Buffalo's was earlier Don you know very seldom do you see anybody hold Pittsburgh particularly at home they give them ball then the ball at midfield now the Bills have done it on three occasions they've been up to the task so far maybe that's why they're not coming up firing the ball I I think they better if they're going to move it but we'll see they've got the game breakers one of them off blank you see his head at the bottom of your screen Jerry Butler and Frank Lewis there's the nose out the right side is Ferguson Poppa then he blows up all his caught by the tightend Joe ship but not for much sharded Jennifer stint in play from the Bills 35 he goes out of bounds at about the 38 you're talking John about how tough the Steelers are to be here they've won 13 straight at Three Rivers and 21 of their last 22 backs into the first playoff here in 72 their 57 and eight at home that's right if you're going to throw you're going to try some vulnerable area however when you pick a dirt Winston you're generally picking in the wrong area number 59 Jack ham is out probably for the season with a sprained ankle they put Winston in he's played the other side now he's back on the left side play place both up very well it's second down and seven slid into second base there about the 40yard line lust is putting a few looks a little wet very unusual climate conditions it's overcast silver for Buffalo no score late in the first quarter Jew 4240 Ferguson stands in so it was one of the best linebackers in the league even though he didn't start Pittsburgh so deep in linebackers that cave started this year his third string generally when a linebackers making the tackle on a quarterback behind the line it's a blitz this was not they only sent four linemen in on Ferguson they left a line alignment back at the line of scrimmage to pick up the slack very effective they pulled their offensive line the 42nd time that Joe Ferguson's been sacked this year they've been fooled a lot here's the punt by rusty Jackson downfield T Bell he'll return them all he will not fair catch the corner good special teams play by the bills old Haslett was down there pumping on him next Sunday football 2nd season begins at the AFC wild card game but playoffs will be over for the loser winner divisional playoff competition burst its NFL 79 event exclusive coverage of the AFC wild card game Sunday miss you they haven't capitalized on any of them there's a good field position on each occasion if they don't start hurting some of it into points that's the flow confirmed here's a pitch it's caught by Winslow and he breaks beneath a French wine picks linoleum 7:35 down to the 32 Bradshaw toll in swine yes sir if you're going to go to somebody for a big play this was very well covered by mario clark he's having a fine year when you're trying to handle in Swan and Terry Bradshaw you've got your work cut out you can cease all over the top of Swan just did not get a piece of the ball result big play for Pittsburgh a 24 yard gain on the play so the Steelers now advance the ball down inside the buffalo 33 it's first and 10 no score fire Ana Rocky Bleier the former Notre Dame captain down his 11th year as a Steeler takes it inside the 30 as it's ready to go now this down let's see what happens at second down in about 6 fiftyfour that makes the bottom 725 close to a first down this time Jim Haslett was on this table watchin sometimes the number of tackles that a linebacker makes is not the indicator it's where he makes them you'll notice at Lambert early in his career made a lot of tackles some of them past the line of scrimmage three or four years yards this time hazlit gets held up a little just too long couldn't make the play at the line of scrimmage as a result a third one third and one it is at the bottom just short of the bills 23 yard line the clock is running in the first quarter 50 seconds to play in the quarter and there's no score on the door the world champions have challenged their first scoring attempt the field goal with block end on Franco Harris and he thunders down to the 20yard line it's a first down for the Steelers and Williams the fourthyear defensive end from Ole Miss number 77 was on the stop but Franco Harris that comes into this game having rushed for almost 1,100 yards four point four yards a rush one of his best for carry averages in recent years he's carrying less but getting some more then added a long time in his eighth year now from Penn State caught a lot of balls he is 34 acceptance first intent good day that's the ball touchdown he's only about 510 if the tires are heavy to go through the air step and jump contest he got it on the first hop he could not have extended one more inch to grab the ball got it in his hands pull it down and I'm not certain the Bradshaw was throwing to him if you want to know my viewpoint on the post game Walker damn I'm pretty sure if he say anyway sure hey work fine good and the Steelers get him a spectacular plant here okay I know bradshaw's attention was down the field on the left side let's yeah he was going to Swan wellthrown ball but a great catch now for an update on NFL 79 let's go to Bryant Gumbel in New York well the 15 things outside and issue about the 20yard line and so that will conclude lay at the end of the first quarter the score is the Steelers sent on the bills nothing it will be right back after these messages from your local station California six years ago what a years in the Tramp that was for the Steelers for all pros swine in the first round landed the second round no thirdround start with in the fourth round and Webster in the fifth round nothing to throw LT came with Ephram and Ferguson with a where is it downfield before the ball got there well it's fight by it a good headsup play on Ferguson's part gets them a penalty gets them in a situation where they're out of a hole they can get a drive started they tried to go to the screen Joe Greene was standing right in the middle of it he couldn't throw the ball on the street had to roll out find any sort of all the rivers with a good play draws a penalty okay let's take a look here comes Ferguson little play adder in past salaries paid he's trying to go but but green reads it real early that's a trick that's all real good tackle those speeds get harder and harder to pull off now Ferguson did well to get that ball away because he had LC Greenwood he's get somehow Ferg leaves the game in the second quarter Furguson digging in he closed Lambert and puts the heat on the receiver Mike Hoggard Stano defense don't take much to get them ready you just rattle the cage just a little bad luck when you've thrown a boat of your back you do not want to run in to a blitz defense that puts Lambert mantoman on tie you're all over the field as soon as Collier comes out of the backfield Lambert's on him like glue the ball gets there just about the time Lambert jackals and Monday night's loss at Houston second down and ten by the run of those nothing eras gets Berk shuts down Terry Miller Don you get the feeling Joe Greene knows what this game means yeah he's standing in there on that particular occasion he Hale he stood up the left the right side of the offensive line for Buffalo and with it the ball carrier that's one of the greatest replays I've seen all season you see him take out an allpro guard Jalan Alor you can see the lament over Visia we have third down and nine for failing 7up in Ferguson against the rest look at these guys come moving forward just before John van effect level Gary Dunn 67 was at like something surrealistic honk jumping over people there's no secret when you play Pittsburgh you've got to execute whether you throw the ball or run the ball it's the third third and nine situation for Buffalo very tough call for a quarterback everybody gets in their starting blocks tries to get to the quarterbacks position before he does that time Banaszak did back deep he Bell ready to receive another punt from rusty Jackson Jackson standing back at a 17 yard line to play in the first half repeatedly Jackson did well together the way there is a penalty marker down I think the penalty will be on Buffalo because the punter took a little too much time to kick it since it hit the ground he made a good play but you're getting a hurry when you're an offensive lineman take off the force kick offense on the kicking team number 52 illegal downfield refuse first down only the wide men can be 5 yards or more down to deal before the ball is kicked it was an excellent play by Jackson just to pick the ball up but when it takes that long you're going to get caught the wall is down out of the 48 yard line of Buffalo Pittsburgh has the ball first in ten what get enforced tomorrow Don Starwood comes back at the ball this one will go and he has sixty seven receptions and he down to the Buffalo 39 a pickup of eight yards like the most surprised man in the house was Lucius Sanford he thought he was in perfect position he was Bradshaw throws the ball under him he's trying to keep it from going over the top Stallworth comes back right under Sanford makes the play Darla's just got it away as kadish was bearing down on him the John star with his now cut passes in 43 consecutive game second down into Pittsburgh pitch back Joseph frank O'Hara and Harris powers have weighed out of the 35 yardline Jeff Nixon the free safety the rookie from Richmond made the tackle lots of times little things indicate where the plays are successful or not that time Mike Webster just kind of he was he had my kadish nose to nose he shot by him picked up a linebacker and kept the pursuit out we maybe we can pick it up here goes Brett to write five Gators now I fix off a linebacker and keep the pursuit down as a result they picked up five yards so its first intent now for the Pittsburgh Steelers 25yard line of Buffalo gives off to his big back Franco the stutter stepping in the acceleration had been his hallmark at one of the game's premier runners and Franco Harris accelerates ahead 414 yards in a first down you know most teams when they get players hurt kind of stay away from the replacements they don't feature them in Pittsburgh's case they've got Peterson in courses starting for the first time in quite a while they're running to the left side as much as they do the right and just as effectively Chuck Knox says all I do is change the numbers when I put new people in or just as good sometimes you never know how good the replacement is in Pittsburgh because he never gets to play by Nixon Nixon's only been starting now for the last five games but he has five interceptions John stoic goes five to left on second down and ten Lynn Swann is on the right flank Bradshaw here's the Russian tailors yeah he gets it Ruben picks it down inside the 15 yard line second and ten he might have a first down the scores are coming in and some of the guys have cashed in a think maybe New England has right now Cleveland was beating Cincinnati six to nothing Brian Sipe pass to Dave Logan for 33 yards and a touchdown New England's come back now Grogan Horace ivory touchdown Patriots leader hiking I think John Madden said it he said Terry Bradshaw's the most important single player on any team in the National Football League right now I happen to agree with him he does so many things well here's an occasion where his receiver was well covered he had to pick up a first dad puts his head down and picks it up let's see if we can figure out what happened Charles Rome's covered the black deed I was accidental oh it's Freeman came in I wrote him down helmet came off and apparently took a cleat on the head I'm sure he'll be back he's liable not to miss it down but we're gonna keep him after a while crews Eck is in there in his fourth year from Boston College he doesn't have the arm of Bradshaw nor the running ability but when he's been in there he's been a very effective quarterback next case let's go to the van John I put the helmet back and he's ready to go back in first and go now from the two yard line for Pittsburgh go Harris takes it down close to the Golan but does not take it in with 11:28 to play in the first half this one down going to come back a nice place to have to go bitch back martinbrock Harris berries touchdown cool into a torrent sealers rule up 13 points and looking for a 14th as far as back out on the field with 1056 to play in the half you remember what Pittsburgh started to roll it started with a little skirmish between the line allure and Lambert early in the first quarter the Steelers were a little lackadaisical all of a sudden they got their act together put 14 points on the board and they're playing very well there is fire 14a nothing there's a break in the action here at Three Rivers Stadium will be back with Pittsburgh kicking off the Buffalo after the 45 yard line Mel Blount that's how good the Steelers are they have off pros plan on their special teams made the play NBC sports world salutes the champions of 79 it's been a memorable year and we'll review its many magic moments with an exciting look back at the year's major events on sports year 79 of salute to the champions at next Saturday on sports world Carrie Bradshaw there was a live shot there looking first insane Buffalo 24yard run bill Ferguson needs the big plane out here he's got power good play good execution against a big rush in the bills get the ball across midfield and down to the 49 yard line of goods Berg Joe Ferguson was so good in high school at Burke Jones went into Ferguson pictus college then Bert Jones selected his they both came out of high school the same year Ferguson of course picked Arkansas Jones went to LSU I say both of them to pick the school they played pretty well for that's something every 16 completion gets in the end zone second down a tour now for buffalo an ex dealer thunders through the Pittsburgh defense upfront and then rams the ball right down inside of 40 to the 36 alright sometimes you have to your guests and once in a while you're wrong that time Jack Lambert was in a position thought he could make the play you can see him coming out couldn't get there in time Reggie McKenzie got to him before he could get a piece of Collier big game a 12yard gain on the play so it's first in ten buffalo bills failing 40 nothing second quarter ladies he goes emotions Furguson go right back to it got a good horse ride and boilesen italia right up the Steelers again he's down inside the 30 you know when you when you sit down and you research a team or I say you get into preparation you say hey in second and four first and ten there's certain situations and tendencies they come off their right side off their right tackle a lot Lambert thought it was coming right there played the play was wrong Steve Furness was on the tackle but six yards downfield at second down a long four for Buffalo as they have the ball down to the 32 yard line of Pittsburgh 853 the play first half 14 nothing Steelers bitch back there this is dog tricky with John Prodi Three Rivers Stadium Pittsburgh Pennsylvania temperatures in the forties the Steelers with the game they must win to take the AFC Central Division once again out in front 14 nothing Bradshaw through to Swann 19 yards out for the first touchdown and Franco Harris took it in from a yard away behind a big block blown by Sidney Thornton for the second touchdown new tight ends for Buffalo Joe chip Ron Howard its third down Ferguson's looking Luis whoa had the ball on his hands and he would have gone a long way as he had cleared out underneath the deep drop dropped it and here comes the field goal unit yeah I think Joe ship should have caught the ball but Bergesen threw it way too hard it was a very short distance between the quarterback and the receiver nobody around him all he had to do was just kind of look it over the top of the linebackers head would have been a big game that I've got a cry kick a field goal you can see Ferguson knows it he threw it a little harder than he needed to just made it a little tougher catch and didn't get it with rookie Dan minutiae holding at the 37 yard line Nick Nick Amaya 47yard field and no hits in his gift there and up short fairly to hold was babble briefly and then Nick Myers timing was off we'll take a look again when this happens done usually the holder doesn't get it down in time as a result when you get your backswing caught nothing good happened and we'll be back at Three Rivers Stadium in a moment this Burgos 126 yards total in this game 61 Steelers on 1st and 10 go to Franco Harris and Shayne Nelson who's Buffalo's leading tackler this season number 59 makes the stop he's in his third year from Baylor the linebacking has been the strongest area Buffalo's defensive play Robertson has lit Nelson and Sanford the handoff goes to Harris he turned the corner to the 30yard line in a fine defensive play by Shane Nelson number 59 who ran him down and so it's going to be third and long now we pause briefly for station identification buffalo guard christian ken from their twenties playing the first down Tyler didn't find anything up the middle to turn the corner gets outside runs the ball very nicely across the 25yard line this telecast is presented by authority of the National Football League and is intended for the private use of our audience any rebroadcast or other use of this telecast without the express written consent of the Pittsburgh Steelers in the National Football League is prohibited last time the bills have to fall down they moved the ball pretty well at the line of scrimmage there people were moving the Steelers back that time they got stuffed and Talia picked up a little out of go second down and three a line of scrimmage and that was all Dennis Winston 53 knocked him down buffaloes Owen 604 six in this game on third down conversions they had third down on about two coming out Pittsburgh lead 14 nothing second quarter and here Joe Ferguson gunning it in Jerry Butler was quite open for just a moment and the hamburgo as the six interceptions almost had another one you hit that ride wide open for just a moment because my car was running a pattern underneath and Fergus has been able to see Butler early I think he would have had him kind of just a little late car you took Lambert right into the middle of the play fourth down fourth into and that sends Rutsey Jackson out onto the field a punt once again for Buffalo with 449 to play in the first half San Francisco leading Atlanta 1410 second quarter line drive punt key bear we'll take that one and here it comes back at buffalo across the 40 Angelle gets to the 44yard line with the Steelers going offense once again first and ten so Pittsburgh with Jerry Bradshaw quarterback in a 14nothing lead Sam the offense back out onto the field we'll be back in a moment NBC's coverage of ncdoublea basketball got underwear yesterday with DePauw upsetting UCLA in Los Angeles next Saturday another matchup of two of the nation's best teams defending ACC champion North Carolina led by allamerica forward Michael porins goes against Bobby Knight and his Indiana Hoosiers at Bloomington at the two o'clock eastern time next Saturday here on NBC here comes Franco Harris I'm first in hand harris carry to the 45 yard line he got 11 in the first down and a Pittsburgh fans are getting more excited because they know you know it's funny what certain teams the fans seem seem to think their team should work on with Pittsburgh it's when they get way ahead they don't seem to blow people out of the ballpark and a lot of fans have mentioned that concern it seems to have been a tendency it's a nice it's a nice way to go when when that's the biggest concern you've got as a fan okay I'll let you have the concession for Steeler hats everybody here's got one on Paris is now gained 49 yards as well terrific that job play fakin swings it out there's Benny Cunningham looks away it was Mike Webster and Larry we passed the same type they through early in the ballgame on the first series of plays when you have a center that's this flexible that can do this many things as a football player you can call these sort of plays this is a little screen back to Cunningham number 52 Webster is the man knocking the linebacker down finally they rustle the big guy from Clemson to the ground its first and ten Pittsburgh 29 yard line of Buffalo let's quick screening to Star Wars Broncos in front what a wellexecuted play Buffalo's linebackers penetrated well again knock it down Sherman white 83 was through along with Jeff Nixon and child's roams you know then when you when you look at Pittsburgh I guess that their total yardage statistic is not surprising to anyone they do more things they have more variation for their offense and the best personnel playing no wonder they're going to break expect starwars now at 68 receptions and those stealing records and five to Pittsburgh 259 to play in the first back Bill's nothing that job takes a look malicious Sanford was coming out of linebacker blitz secondyear linebacker from Georgia Tech 57 and Kadish knocked him down should be interesting to see they've got a holding call against the Pittsburgh linemen it would take them out of field goal range so I feel assured that they'll take the penalty be third and five and the Steelers are getting five yards without too much trouble per plate though there's a timeout on the field with 254 to play in the first half Pittsburgh leading 14 to nothing and Chuck Noll waiting to hear now I think he may insert Jim Smith into the ball game into the three very wide receiver offense if they've got 15 to go Lee offense number 79 second down got the right tech Oh Larry Brown Jim Smith goes in big burly Benny Cunningham conduct and for these big five to the right goes winds wanna goers ranked on the left is Jim Smith second down and 15 bill jumped offside German white within the encroachment zone when of hours of nap so the Steelers will get back five it'll be second down in about nine their whole defense is gone Fergana doctors you know playing the Buffalo probably in three years Red John technique I think you did this game today crime goes up onehanded requested a couple of tickets to this game and they think he's here my understanding is part of his package in Montreal is that to get the full money package he's got to play there three years but if he thinks he's going to own part of the Canadian team he's dreaming they're not interested in Americans only anything in Montreal the vows at the 29yard line it's going to be third down in ten Bradshaw has had a lot of time to throw but the defenders have been on his receivers pretty close third down and ten now for and out wide either side here's the deep drop he froze and he's got Franco Sevan Buffalo might have it now to the Steve Abid David buffalo has the ball will grow crowd what a terrible well you know Franco made a fine play he's made that kind of mistake all year long he's trying to pick up extra yards when he does so he might be switching the ball from hand to hand and has fumbled more than in the past so the bells stopped the stealer challenge and they don't have the ball first intended the 21 Terri had to go to his back his wide receivers will cover downfield through a perfect fall of two Franco Harris he got it hit and lost it Buffalo's ball first and ten he's got thirty six receptions this year that's a careerhigh the Buffalo dogs first in Jenin here's swinging it up diving at the ball and it was not a well don't bother making the catch is Mike codger who's 28 to play in the first half yesterday green baby Detroit 1813 Jets beat Miami 27 24 and at halftime we'll be going to New York where Bryant and Micra standing by to update us on NFL 79 second down and ten for Buffalo Ferguson take city shop takes to look what's a rip out there is when will it look the cone and he had the bottle often the car looking back at the bar with all those Steelers converging on that takes some heart it's got to be the worst feeling in the world you know that balls coming you know everybody else is too you've got to keep your attention on it he did a good job of that loofa cone that's very big but boy he can play special teams terror if you're a receiver and a quarterbacks throwing that ball down the middle you know you saying hurry up boy get it here quick Lauren caves and Dwayne Woodruff pinned down the past coverages we have third down good throwing a great catches Frank Lewis turned in and had a bend back out leaned in to get the ball for a buffalo first down he also stopped the clock after a 21yard gain getting out of bounds in order to catch 53 balls for over a 20 yard average you have to be an outstanding pattern runner Frank Lewis has been that when he was in Pittsburgh he was a great pattern runner this time he gets Ron Johnson turned around cuts out gives himself some room to the sideline big gain and they've got a chance to get on the board first gets for Frank Lewis today 21yard gain is 54 than a Stephen he's been averaging 20 ounces cats having a great season first down and ten for Buffalo 42yard line of the bill to a team to play in the first half target selector rep Lewis goes up and gets another one now they ruin had his hands down in the lawsuit the Steelers Krypton Doni show is covering then it's my opinion looking at that at the back judges view of the play that he thought he stepped out of bounds I don't know if he did or not but you must have the ball and it's rule never really good so it's at the 42 yard line and second down in tennis coming up Lewis was the number one draft choice of the Pittsburgh Steelers out of Grambling nine years ago in the second season of Buffalo looks like a young dirty they go to the run on second down and ten they've got to loosen up the defense a little bit as the Steelers are teeing off here's in back in a comin on a snap well now that they've established they're going to throw the ball on first down second down third down whenever they get an opportunity a draw should be effective on occasion they've got plenty of time they can do what they want now they've still got two minutes few minutes to go in the first half and we'll have Buffalo with the bone we return this book for all the people who make the sidelines a part of the show yeah just three years that distinctively claimed crisp taste that says Budweiser begins a football the Steelers in the game they must win to pick the AFC Central Division are leading the bills 14 to nothing Buffalo has the ball at their 45 yard line 3rd down and 7 coming up for Fergus two minutes to play in the first half clothes he's got his man but Luca Kong lost him dad it took a couple of steps and I think it's me here that when he was falling down so very nearly a big gainer for Buffalo but it's along out the bills will punt the ball back with 154 to play in the half you know we haven't seen Jerry Butler catch a ball today and there's good reason why a guy doesn't catch the ball generally he's TT get that one for 27 yards but he has been double team since and hasn't been close to it five for 35 is the punting average for rusty Jackson T bell number 83 is back deep now for the Steelers a high fun knock down field and Dell will feel the tethers what happens John once those feet leave the ground like that I'll tell Europe for grabs there's a Bentley marker down so la assess what the penalty is the punt of 48 yards was returned 16 yards by t bell there are very few punt returners who are still returning punts as effectively as this man is after they've been in the league for five years as he has it's a real asset to have one who does it well there is the call on the penalties on the receiving team 21:27 unsportsmanlike conduct between down first down Steelers became unsportsmanlike odds on 27 one of the guilty parties and also Carl I think twentyone did he say let's get up first in ten now for the Steelers that's rolling out the suit a time he lumps it up in the air Cunningham goes to the ball low hazard Maori oh picked it up I don't know how Mario headed back up field with the football so he's been doing better than Buffalo receivers have been lately that footing is very tenuous right down there between the 40 and 50 yard line any pattern that you're going to run don't make any break in between that area Bradshaw knows that he's got his receivers running straight patterns crossing patterns he tries to make a great throw out of a bad situation and this is what happens usually when you do that whoops but they do have the ball in great field position Lin swans down they're covered by Clarke just hanging around the ball sometimes something comes up with that's a great reaction thanks I'll hit the open man all right first intent now for Buffalo 42 yard line Furguson swings it out higher catches the ball but there's always Tyger down four to twenty and the Terrible Towels are aways in here in Pittsburgh well Buffalo's coming up to the line of scrimmage as we see this play Lambert creates a situation again he knows it's a very important to dig here Furguson clothes and twice today Lambert is not big as middle linebackers go he's six four which is job but he's only 220 a lot of guys in the league of playing 245 but he's exceptionally strong as we saw evidence by and throwing 215 pound Mike Collier down like a sack of we nobody told him he wasn't big he is a striker well they got some great wasn't that deep huh go green backed up by yeah got the strong safety shell free allpro right down the middle right now there's a break in the action of 54 seconds to play in the first half we'll be back supplied right showers for cone Butler's on the left lines are doubling up on Butler Koza make some coverage off Luis Henley markers down heard of the clothes instantly was built for the defense then the next year Bradshaw came in focal point of the effect shortly thereafter on their way and here is the thing fastgrowing hook 20 little so behind by lc Greenwood who popped in ahead for three or four yards in a third down and 11 play the bills got about six down at the 35 yard line with 33 seconds left there now sending out their field goal unit 28 seconds on the clock running run it right down and call a timeout I must the Steelers do first which they apparently are not about to this surprises me I think they've taken time out now because they sent their punting team on the field and that doesn't make any sense at all it is their punter Jackson out there he's heading off and working on getting on the same page here you know Todd they have to do something to get back in this ball game turning the ball over with 15 seconds to play when they've got a chance to pick up a first end get some points on the board he's not taking a chance of getting on there now the offense is coming back on the field Baltimore's beating the giant 17 nothing at the half Chuck knocks and there's the veteran bill Munson in the red jacket to the left backing up Joe Ferguson along with the rookie Dan Manucci who knocks thinks is going to be an NFL player Manucci we're watching Joe Ferguson with Knox that man in the red jacket is Bill Munson he's been around for 16 years Joe said he's helped him quite a bit this year just from a settling down situation they've become good friends Munson agrees with me that Ferguson might have the best arm he's ever seen it's a pretty good arm he can Iver E strong Ferguson not that much weight only weighs about 188 but he works on the weight machines there's a lot of calisthenics stretching he's getting am like a good catcher he just flicks the ball behind his ear one big play right now could put this ball game back in the Hat is it all pittsburgh throughout the first half seven point difference is not the difference between these two teams fourth down and four they field around a field goal range so they go from scrimmage with 15 seconds left a lot of time get away here's Lewis down the sideline it's simply this what about 18 seconds run off the clock tone a pound of ten and Pittsburgh takes over the ball with a 14 jumping lead and they're about ready to take their winnings for the first two quarters to the locker room the problems been in Buffalo's case when they have thrown the fall of Ferguson hasn't had enough time to allow his receivers to get into the secondary and run their routes as a result he's kind of throw it before they break and the ineffective this is Chilton has shown the problem well the Bills have had trouble running the ball and Ferguson has been rushed ignored more and more as the Steelers who knew this game was important they're playing like a playoff team they're geared up and ready here start the last play of the first half running ahead and getting across the 40yard line and so the clock runs out the first half ends and the Pittsburgh Steelers take the 14nothing lead to the locker room NFL 79 a complete report on this 16th weekend at play is coming up here on NBC Steelers scored on a touchdown pass to Bradshaw to Lynn Swann 19 yards and later on a Franco Harris touchdown run from a yard out Buffalo's been knockin Ferguson's been so close too many throws John I think Don they just have to give a little more time to get his receivers open they could make this in number 30 years in the middle Nate Hawthorne's on the left Pittsburgh Steelers with a lotta good people lined up on their kickoff return in fact deep and he falls spending over his way but Anderson's going to movie Heineman taken Jeff Nixon 38 was down to make the tackle an official team for the Buffalo Bills they go on offense the Steelers do now first intend offense for the Pittsburgh Steelers their quarterback is Terry Bradshaw the runners are Rocky Bleier and frank O'Hara so though we're going to see a lot of Thornton it appears in the second half and thorns in the game now to start good deep dark wide receivers Jam star Worth and Lynn Swann tight end Benny Cunningham the Webster on the left side Larry Brown is in right tackle Franco Harris carries in a first down plane advances the belt across the 30 the bills defensively line up with the front three Ben Williams 77 Mike Kadish 71 Sherman white 83 linebackers 58 I say Robertson 55 Jim Haslett the rookie 59 Shane Nelson 257 Lucius Sanford Mario Clark and child Rome's other corners Jeff Nixon and Steve second down at eight for the Steelers wretch stands in throws it down star with has the ball Val's Rome's got him around the could finally bring him down with his a big gain on the play down to the out to the 46 yard line it's a first down for Pittsburgh you give Bradshaw that much time his receivers have a chance to run alternate routes they were covered on their original wrap they moved it around a little bit II spotted stallworth open just like eggs in a basket when you go back there and you're not rushed and you're not hurried you see Williams got in for the early but he stepped underneath there was no one to force him to throw early when that happens this Keating is backing a line now for Buffalo number 52 a rookie from Maine heaven laughs the oligo in Sydney Carton who had some injury problems after starting out great he was up and about for weeks with an ankle injury his back and raring to go in playoff form Thornton and the big game they're receiving a Bradshaw pass no people have talked about how well Rocky Bleier rocks and he does he's also an excellent runner and his is yard per carry average as the other two backs is is over four yards of carry but this guy not only can run with the football he can block he can catch he's an allpurpose back pitch first got two of them and they also have another first down that start amount of challenge in the third quarter they Thornton gets the Carla gap D is down to the 27 yard line heating on the tech well Keating will be in there the rest of the way hazlit has been thrown out of the game we haven't spelled it out to us they have not is just what the lesion is well if they've stated that he's got a personality like Jack Lambert somebody said he kicked bradshaw first but I don't know if that's the reason but I do know he's not in the ball game buggin down in five coming up now for Pittsburgh my bars advance down close to the 25yard line on a second down and five it'll bring up third and Fred look very much to find out if we can what the reason Hassler is out of the game for we'll get down to our sideline men Chuck knows first season in Pittsburgh one victory 13 losses that was the Terry Bradshaw year Bradshaw suffered that prep scalp as it was thrown out for unnecessary roughness Oh God Harris to the outside before Jeff Nixon Knutson down he really got a lot of help that time from John Stallworth he kind of waited lap Stallworth to come back from his wide receiver position chop down a linebacker and allowed him to go outside pick up a big game we'll watch it again now from the end zone replay well Bradshaw hands off to Franco it's a trap play the Steelers trap everybody you can see Mullins gets a pretty good block but now here comes star worth all the way from the inside Franco sets him up goes to the outside first repent the way lynn swann goes for the ball onehanded guarding him on the play was Mario Clark who has 1 interception today so it will be second down at 10 through Pittsburgh 14 yard line of Buffalo you can see Bradshaw figured he'd have Swann open Mario Clark's got the toughest job in the world he has no help to the inside from the linebackers the linebackers are man to man on the backs in this instance Clark's got him all over the field Lin gets inside but he just can't pick up enough ground to get to the ball the Steelers 25 pound backfill in a fivefoot 10 inch frame crashes on down to about the 8 yard line he was a little disappointed I think he lost his footing a bit when he made his cut up the field he can have two good blockers out in front of him if the Steelers win today it'll be the 100th win foot this burg under Chuck no he'll become a fourteenth NFL coach coming to haunted games the Steelers now with 100 yards rushing in the game and not many teams have done that against Buffalo recently Bills have been real tough to move the ball again Buffalo's defense coming into this game one touchdown a game for the last four weeks they're about to give up a furnace partners in the he's persuaded his power drives it right out in they say Mike Webster we're going to run another crap block you get turban our guard whenever they feel they have to get yardage inside the 10yard line they do it effectively George picked up the last three yards on his own but take a look you can see Larry Brown's Krakens down gets the defensive tackle allows Thornton to get through at the point of attack and he carries it right on into the end zone that's tough down there and these guys do it consistently well what they do they just fire on up with snap blast away at the defensive front then those power backs pour through and that time Thornton takes it in and so the extra point by that fire up and good and Pittsburgh extends its lead to a commanding 21 nothing Steelers ain't going to be hooked in the head when he ran to the barn last I wrote it now the run Keith Modi is out across the 2220 Pittsburgh Steelers just going 71 yards in nine plays their third touchdown those of you watching in Pittsburgh Buffalo and Tampa Bay will see this game in its entirety if it gets more out of hand if you put any more points out and the rest of the network may very well be switching to the Kansas City Tampa Bay Buccaneers game there comes Joe Ferguson in the bills first in ten at their 26 yard line kickoff of the second half and subsequently turned it right down to a touchdown Furguson flows Louis seem to be behind the cast covers but the ball was tipped away dirt Winston 53 I mean they're calling the plays that they hope can get him back in the ballgame but I can't even see anybody open from up here done so you know Fergus was having trouble that time Winston got right in the lane his intended receiver Frank Lewis had no case none at all it'll be second down and ten now for the Buffalo Bill Ferguson can do the game having hit 53 percent of his throws Casper 14 touchdown 15 interception within soft postseason 42 times that's the hurt second in ten my card arrogant five got to the line of scrimmage yellow green 75 knocked him down and white white is in it right defensive end 78 Steve Bernal 64th the left tackle right tackle LC green winning Joe green the left side of that defensive front they give you a lot of luck stuff there you have to crows Gary ball he gets the ball but the dealers have that first down marker hemmed off you're not going to get to this all right that play is designed to go behind the linebacker but Butler cannot get deep enough easily enough to be able to take it all the way behind the linebacker the Ferguson wouldn't have had time to throw we had to cut it underneath the backers they did so they recovered the template short of the first down and once again T Bale is back to receive a buffalo punt there is the Ponte rust ejection Gale takes it at the 21yard line thanks to look there's a penalty turns the corner put races down try to get enough to pass and knocking out about Mike higher finally ran T bailout tthey'll would number 83 would be starting on a lot of NFL teams as a wide receiver returning punts is all the work you can get here at pittsburgh they've got another one Jim Smith that might be playing for quite a few teams and when he did play he looked like a carbon copy of the other two you talked to the Pittsburgh players in they are very aware of the talent this team has and the way it's been put together but another big attribute the Steeler organization has is a tremendous camaraderie these guys like to play in Pittsburgh Super Bowl years or not that's how you become a good team back number 27 holy right now after the penalty assessment there's a break in the action and timeout will return to Three Rivers Stadium in a five yards passing looking for Dora Dixit can up and wrestling down well it it looks to me as though Pittsburgh is not is working on their weakness because they have not let Buffalo up since early in the second quarter they continue to put points on the board and they continue to go after them this play when things are going well they just seem to fall in place both Buffalo defenders run into each other knocking each other out of the place Sidney Thornton turns it into a big Gator well the Steelers have it all first droppings what surprise intercepted dicks another six minutes up to hey this kids going to be in the league a long time he doesn't play like a rookie well that's a Kimmy right there Don Bradshaw has thrown a few passes in the last three or four weeks that that really look a little suspect now that ball should not have been thrown it's thrown in the middle of the field soft it's the kind of pass you throw when you figure you can do no wrong and as soon as you start thinking that way you do a lot of things wrong he's trying to throw off balance to a to a wide receiver running straight down the field into his own defense you can't get away with it so the deals going offense first June 10 after 30 panic in a game 21 enough of Ferguson hands off the codger and hazard crashes out across 430 outflows to the 33yard line we pause briefly for station identification this is the NBC television network another I am what the Steelers women's game and I give second down and six Ferguson takes the drop look stands in close hey when you start getting with a quarterback to start playing to play that time shell was the intended receiver as far as he was concerned he jumped in front of Lewis Lewis had no chance to make the play get a little active down there Azra revved up the steelers will had a couple of weeks off if they win this game and the flow after its first possession hadn't been in the general vicinity of the Steeler endzone all day long the quarterbacks for the Steelers Blount and Johnson have been playing face to face against the wide receivers in doing so they've taken their routes away they've made their wide receivers come in to their holes late it's a hen the pass rush has been good it's allowed their safeties to play the ball the shell comes up with an interception up and yelling whooping and stopping here can't get enough court on that big NFC Central battle weather is a big factor Tampa Bay in Kansas City our scoreless in the fourth quarter but in Tampa day meanwhile Chicago's leading st. Louis 14 to nothing in very cold weather in a second quarter of Soldier Field in Chicago well it's just like Tampa Bay's behind then if they're tied because they lose if they die red shell 1120 177 yards in a touchdown those and here's the Bills get the ball back get the little sloppy folks the Fremen line about the guy who scooped it up as Franco Harris coughed it up it's the fourth turnover for the Steelers they've turned the ball over quite a bit this year and they've still been the most productive team in the National Football League that kind of puts to rest that old cliche about fumbles injuries and turnovers done it right now as Buffalo comes out to go first in ten there'll be a break in the action with 543 left to play in the third quarter and a Steelers leading the Buffalo Bills but he was enough it's wet but it's not that wet right right Mad Dog right they call him whether trying hard to give it back and forth each other dry right after one play it's the ball right back from Buffalo and now the Steelers going off into the 29 yard line of Buffalo first in ten I'm going to check the footballs well they changed them every plane and they can't all be wedded before they're in use it's just one of those exchange problems you see Webster kind of slides it right right through Bradshaw has hands that fumbles on the quarterback but the ball is a little bit slick check it out at 13 now for the Steelers his Bradshaw looking deep swash wannabe 21 yard line Vaughn ran the dpad and then cuts back in the booth with us right now is mrs. Terry Bradshaw Jojo Starbuck Jojo do you think all is well I taste smell apparently it must be just another day at the plant because that's a replay when you hit 21 to nothing the old man's gonna be the night to have to get kicked in the head a little headache still no score so the bills pour through and that play am a knock down Bradshaw back of the 40yard line of Buffalo and that brings up fourth down and here is again as we see Buffalo get its first sack of the Pittsburgh quarterback well again this time franchise receivers were open but he didn't have enough time the pass rush has to improve a whole lot of things have to change around but they're liable to get blown right out of town Williams caters and Sherman Whitehall smoking on Kruk and so now it's fourth down coming up Colquitt without the field for one is infrequent punting appearances the angles for the near sideline Rudi to go out of bounds if it does goes out of bounds at about the oneyard line the sealers really have it rollin right now with 423 left to play in the third quarter and Pittsburgh in the lead 21 to number one yard line tries to crash out with Kali on the carry but the Steelers slam it right down and a third quarter clock runs with 410 to play in the game and the Steelers in the lead 21 nothing you know Don this is a type type of ballgame where there is no type of brilliance as far as play selection is concerned that's going to get you out of a trap the players are not playing up to their capabilities and they haven't been throughout the last few quarters it second down and ten now Joe Ferguson will have third down in about ten coming up were the unhappy option of throwing from his end zone or running it again into the Pittsburgh defense and then having his putter dicken from 11 yards back rather than 15 the way gannets you don't have an option because if you've got to throw the ball into 21 points behind I don't care what yard line you're on if you want to get back in the ball game I'll accept that if you want to keep the score down run it alright they all told me 112 on third down conversion Furguson close and it was an out Louis was going applaud pattern attempt completed rusty Jackson's gotta have to hope for a good snap because the Steelers are going to be rushing hard the bills won't have the usual 15 yards the putter normally takes in his drop they'll have about 11 rusty Jackson lining up the Steelers drop that key bell and it with ten good job he got it away and hid it well he drives people back to the 47 yard line Bell is hold in excellent special teams played by Buffalo getting the ball away now a couple of the guys mix it up here and we'll be back at Three Rivers Stadium after this kid or that his helmet was off but his brother Craig is sitting in front and my mom in California told me how bad it looked on the closeup that's the only way I knew it's good to see Lin bag Bernadette he's alright well you girls are going to the Super Bowl again I guess I know she can be old this isn't it thanks for coming by that's a good luck ok mr. Terry Bradshaw and mrs. Lynn Swann Joe Joe and Bernadette and right now the Pittsburgh Steelers half of all second down and six coming up 32 yard Buffalo Bills Pittsburgh leading the game the partners he is a truck Darton now running hard down to the 30 very difficult to execute any sort of a reverse play or or a trap play when you when you're playing in in wet conditions and right down there between the 30 and the 45 it has stayed wet throughout the ball game garden with those seven rushes today star wars on star with his crop three passes for 26 yards bringing the season total of sixty nine receptions a new Steeler record three now for Terry and a third down carry he drives ahead for five yards in a stealer first down I say a Robertson number 58 knock him down 850 left to play in Tampa Bay and in the rain Neela Donahue's field goal from 19 yards out keeps the Buccaneers 3 points up on Kansas City she's looking to close with an eight need record on the year late and hot in recent weeks the Bears beating st. Louis at Soldier Field 21 to nothing now now running it down to the 21 yard line is Sydney Thornton Shane Nelson was on the tackle the Houston Oilers are going against the Philadelphia Eagles and our season finale today at the Astrodome of course the charges and the Broncos where did it tee it up we won't know until Tuesday morning Bradley New York time we did then the computers have to stay in condition or everybody's back in the dark Franco Harris is rushed for ADR today carries Badshah tightend going for the ball of the toka throw 2nd down and 7 play they go incomplete so it'll be third down and 7 some of those stealers pump that iron they let you see those muscles three guys and their offensive line benchpress over 500 and they like to wear those shorts reassures jerseys don't they you can see Bradshaw is have a little problem finding anybody on this play the ball was actually a little bit over throw that's a man he very seldom misses connection with Randy Grossman as a fine receiver and he's come he's come to be a pretty fine blocker too now the Steelers go through down and seven first moves to the left side that's all has time it was gone I had to step out the defense with the ball came in hot he's like cooking him to throw the ball where he wanted but it was pretty good defense by the linebackers this ones on a crossing pattern when you get a lot of time you can afford to call crossing patterns Pittsburgh's had that luxury all day long takes a long time to develop this pattern Bradshaw gets enough time but the linebackers drop in he has to throw the ball over the top that file accepted he's got it up in the air but he is wide to the right so it's no good in Buffalo takes over the ball as time runs out in the third quarter Pittsburgh Buffalo and Tampa Bay you'll see the entirety this game but for the rest of our network we're going to switch to the Kansas City Tampa Bay game which is coming down the stretch Jay Randolph and Paul McGuire Mike Webster the allpro center was drafted in the fifth round and that great craft year 1974 and he is regarded he was a unanimous selection to the Pro Bowl team players and coaches voting on it everybody voted for Mike Webster as the AFC Center right now it is first count in ten for the Buffalo Bills just outside their 20yard line here time to all backpack his arm and then no time to reload because Joe Greene was there and white white was there Don they just took the left side of the offensive line and pushed him right back to Ferguson he was trying to go in a little hook and go to Luis pumpfake now Luis is down the field too late boys what you really worry about here is losing your quarterback with a shoulder separation when people that big fallen on his hard artificial turf well I'm sure it doesn't come up in Ferguson's mind injuries being part of the ball game but it there are some questions that might be asked about you know this is the third game in a row that Buffalo has failed to put any points on the board or offensively early in the season they were really rolling up the points they robbed Rowland hooks takes the ball out across the 20yard line close to the 24 brings the ball ahead for Buffalo and the bills with 1417 showing on the game clock trailing in the game 21 to nothing have needed a big play all game long it looked like they might get some when they came up throwing early and drove down the field their first possession of the game they kicked a field goal but it was negated by a delay of game call 5yard penalty was marked off and subsequently Buffalo's field goal attempt by Nick Amaya the second time was blocked that's his post they've been to a score it's third down seven now for the bills Furguson takes a deep dive swing the ball it's intercepted a lot tase had it lost it they're going to Mike Collier but there was nothing there and Lauren days very nearly had it as Ferguson goes off had the play been complete it would have been short of a first down and people say well why do you throw it there will you do because you don't have time to throw it to anybody else James was all over Collier was in perfect position to make the interception there covenant like blankets and rusty Jackson comes out once Florida Park nine punts underway and there was this ninth in the air and TBL ready to return it for a knife time great punt returners boy they stand there and dance and we've a little bit not of a sudden the stutter step and they explode through a gap and they can be gone and evil is one of them that can go the distance we'll be back at Three Rivers Stadium in a moment and on NBC live action Franco Harris gets the call runs into Shane Nelson advances the ball out across the 45 yard line on a first down carry Harris is ahead for three yards for Pittsburgh show the Steelers given up after that tough loss Monday night get a better idea just the overall class of this organization at penalty call are the onside kick call which the league office later rule wasn't missed officials mistake never again enough one thing in print and the Steelers about Buffalo well the funny thing is Pittsburgh felt they shouldn't have left it into a situation that that one call could dictate the outcome and I think that's that's what champions are like and always is our true knee that starts standing up looking better than ever one of the founding fathers of the National Football League along with George Halas and now his son's run the franchise and nobody runs it better any franchise and if you hadn't heard it some fortunate news that George Halas jr. not George Halas senior George Halas jr. died at age 54 of a heart attack in Chicago Georgianna senior going strong at 85 and his bears right now are leading 21 and up being a very saddened day for them straight ahead that carry goes in the Pittsburgh Steelers driving ahead for another first down on a third down in three carry they get it and the Steelers move the chain markers get four new downs and keep the clock running with 11:55 to play Cincinnati Jack Thompson just ran for a touchdown John Jack Thompson from Washington State he might be the next great young quarterback he's got all the tools but he needs to do a little playing time and when Kenny Anderson is ahead of you the playing time is sparse the throwing son Owen the jack Joe Harris closed in on yet another 100yard day he has 89 yards betcha close on first down and a perfect strike that John Stallworth his depth out of bounds at the 32 so this dealers have another first down Bradshaw just rolls out a little bit to the left to give himself a better angle toward the sideline it's a long throw but it's in perfect timing with stalwart just as he turns around Bob there comes the ball how sweet it is Bauer's with his 200th career reception fifth most in stealer history first down and ten Pittsburgh at the 33yard line of upper low Sartain turns out wide gets to the 30 got to it'll be second down and eight knocked down by the lucious Sanford 57 you see the big power backs of Pittsburg come out of the three points little cross buck Thornton takes one one step behind Franco doesn't happen there's a lead blocker it's another trap play field is still a little bit slippery if you don't find a hole at first you're going to have a little problem creating one and the temperature is starting to drop in Pittsburgh 21:16 in england whaling boom touchdown run swing pass goes out to Franco Harris's to the 30 and no more on a second down and eight plate it'll bring up third down and eight it gets a little rough here in December just like they like it and Pittsburgh where Steeler football danza City trailing Tampa Bay the Buccaneers with a playoff chance if they're in if they win that game Baltimore hitting the slumping Giants twenty four to seven in the fourth quarter San Francisco looking for its third win its second in a row leading Atlanta and the Bears leading st. Louis 21 to nothing the Steelers on a third down seventh play go to three wide I'm Joey the head to the 10yard line he is thrown back with the Steelers are down close in challenging once again with 9:40 to play in the game this is about as open as any receivers been all day long Swan gets inside why are you Clark when he does so the linebacker goes to the other way Bradshaw finally picks him out he's got plenty of time to operate no one was close early but they all close in at the end well touchdown of the season that's just like you throw them up on the board when they get down there you know they're going to trap it but it doesn't seem to change it thing take a look Jerry Mullins pulls from his right guard position rocks the right tackle out of the way and Franco goes untouched into the end zone so Harris with that first up the middle John gets 100 yards for the day another touchdown that far as extra part is once again right there and so the Steelers have commanded the game didn't wanna go if they lead his 28 cinnabar taken downfield by Keith movie he's in the 20 and out across the 25 of the 26 yard line Rick Moser on the special teams play as Franco Harris which the Cape on as the temperature is dropping bowl games coming up on NBC Christmas Day the University of Pittsburgh versus Arizona 3:30 Eastern Time in the fiesta ball and then the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day topranked Ohio State thirdrate at USC with the national championship on the line in the Rose Bowl at 4:30 Eastern Time and that night at 8 o'clock John you and I will be down at the Orange Bowl in Miami as unbeaten Florida State ranked fourth in the country 11 and all on the year goes against 5th grade at Oklahoma the bills go to the run mic palyer takes it across the 35 yard line John what about the bills now on offense with Joe Ferguson the fact that they scored so much and now Sutton their offense just has dried up right now I mean confidence is a is a is it an elusive factor sometimes when you're going real well everything seems so easy just a few bad breaks start to creep into your offense all of a sudden you wonder if you'll ever score another touchdown that's the way it's been for Buffalo and it doesn't take a whole lot to have that happen we've got to find all six in mind but they haven't been able to operate today when they don't get control of the line of scrimmage nobody can do it in Tampa Bay ends its threegame losing streak with a three nothing win in the rain over Kansas City and Tampa Bay the NFC Central Division here takes the swings baskets out of bounds at about the 38 yard line hey les Franco Harris at 6:00 to 225 a just stand next to him he looks like an offensive tackle he's more like 64 240 no you know people don't really take a look at his speed and say he's his feedback but if you if you ever watched him outrun that Tom Darden for Cleveland for 70 yards and Darden didn't great gain of stride if anything he lost one eye that's right there can be no doubt about his speed he's like an old camel you don't need those little breakaway back to the deaf people like Harrison gamble the dishes are run over one the bills on first time go to Mike Dodd he gets it across the 40yard line the backup quarterbacks are working out now for the Steelers Cruz seconds down NFL 79 from New York with Brian Campbell and Mike Adamle will be coming up next with NFL report the concluding week of regular season play you'll be watching a lot of the regulars coming off the field in the last six seven seven and a half minutes Joe Greene just made his accident the Terrible Towels are waving the Steelers dig in so I get that hate coming up now for the Buffalo Bill Guerry bottle guard for the ball bumped off to play by Ron Johnson Ferguson doesn't have time to do anything more than just go back quickly as he can and unload because these tries to set up and look things over he's gone that's one of the few times today that Pittsburgh has sent seven or eight people after the quarterback because they haven't needed to and even when they were mantoman Blount and Johnson covered the receivers as well as they could be covered and there was nowhere to go with the ball Steeler defense has really looked shot and of course it coming off one of the hardest hitting games of the season last Monday night against the Houston Oilers pittsburg now the victory today wins the AFC central ties Dallas's record of making the playoffs eight consecutive years most importantly we'll have a week off now they've got those injured people back and ready Ferguson gets time this time throws it too hard I guess John you played long enough to certainly know when you're standing back there you've been hit a number of times you do have time here still like those I got you you never know when the second ones coming that's how it's coming my crews deck has taken snaps of Mike Webster he's getting set to come in the game the next time Pittsburgh has a tall he Bella's back again but tenth plot he's taken from rusty Jackson and the 10th one he's repair well there is a special teams play one Ken Johnson big guy can run but can they get it in the end zone that's what they need right now Boston 46yard punt dealers get back to the cruise that comes out we take a break in the action here at Pittsburgh the putt now by rusty Jackson downfield of T del the other family market and bail gets the bell across the 35yard line you talk John about the confidence back there and I guess that is a very vital thing when things are going good everything seems to be in gear and then I think what really happens is rather than doing your own job you start doing your other your friends job and people lose confidence in one another not only confidence in themselves and until everybody gets back on page 1 and starts reading from page 1 through the end of the book oftentimes that confidence factor never gets back well it'll be till next August before the bills get it under way again in the preseason they'll have a lot of time to regroup and I'm sure they'll get a good draft and that could put them in a good a good position to contend next year but not today on the run back below 53 facemask 1st down those guys those guys on the punt team must be getting tired you know that's no no picnic running up and down that field getting knocked around the second the Steelers come out on offense first 1010 the Buffalo 47 yard line 6:39 to play here is Greg Hart are their number one draft choice from Baylor a lot of people thought he was the best back in college football coming into the out of the draft in a hip failed injury and he was the last player picked in the first round the steelers could afford that luxury you bet he sees he was a perfect example of what pittsburgh can't afford because they are so talented they could allow him to get his hip well to take some time off not play a lot this year and in the future they feel he'll help him a lot Carrie Bradshaw and Joe Greene Gary get out before he really great game still ha a lot of explosion comes up quickly and hits down for 40 yard line in a second and 5 Gary Nelson made the knocked down for Buffalo along with nose tackle Mike Kadish so the Tampa Bay Buccaneers make it to the playoffs john mccain so our dangling thought it might go away his defense hung in there all year long his offense was a little sporadic but his defense did play when they had to shut somebody out you ought to get to go to the playoffs one of the writers down there open like you say nothing he had much action this year when he gets some he's going to take advantage of it whose deck had three Russians 42 yards up till now this season well he got a pretty good pass rush from Hutchinson who's playing for him his first time today eluded that picked up a first down we've still got the ball just under five minutes to play get out here Mike 22 yards downfield and now the fielders go for some tennis rain starts to flow hard here in Pittsburgh we're running with it all is Anthony Anderson a rookie from Temple is averaging seven yards of rush in his first season or the Steelers have players on top of players problem is how do they don't have enough physicians out here to let everybody play you're playing behind flier and Thorton and Harris you're playing times gonna be low rain is really coming down now the wind is blown the temperatures dropping play off weather in Pittsburgh you wondered what a few people might get up and start heading for the exits but until now they've been here having a great time second down for Hawthorne runs hard gets down to about the nine yard line Jeff Nixon Steve Freeman octave down Hawthorne is 63 220 pounds and a dislocated hip in college fully well this is the heir apparent to Franco Harris they say but I think Franco's going to be doing it for some years to come he doesn't look ready to sack it into me haunted yards today touchdown Steelers in the lead 28 nothing with 254 to play and roaster carries the bar right down inside the 10yard line two about the H on Brody is heading down to the Steelers locker room I'm coming up and inches to go for the first time look for the sickness on the sidelines after it does coach know they'll run the bar once again the clock winds down now close to the twominute warning dealers are just waiting for two minutes and there's a timeout on the field now as the twominute warning is given so my crews egg comes over when we return he'll have a fourth but no explaining here's a handoff Hawthorne Drive yard line there was a one foot carry it he needed that for the first time we'll see if he got it this could be the Steelers first shutout of this season they can keep the bills enjoy again the Buffalo Bills defense hold and Pittsburgh could not get the first down but no sim advice but no avail right now as buffalo takes over the ball first in tama game clock showing 156 to play Cincinnati leading Cleveland 1312 on the fourth quarter New England leading Minnesota 24 16 in the fourth quarter Tampa Bay has beaten Kansas City and won the NFC Central Division three nothing Buccaneers over the cheese Baltimore beating the giants 31 7 now leading San Francisco 3121 Ferguson closed in the end zone and Xavier loses the ball incomplete pass good possibility the Miami Dolphins will be playing here at Pittsburgh and an AFC divisional playoff game a wildcard next week it's going to be interesting to see who will be am at the final weekend of regular season play Oakland with a distinct shot Denver with even a better one Cleveland Browns still in the running if they can win if they lose it Cincinnati that's gone seven teams are in teams are hoping for those battle for a spot I'm second out of 10 Ferguson stands in pros hard and he gets his man Jerry Butler catches the ball he's a racehorse when he gets it so quick cutler with the reception for a big yardage JT Thomas finally knocked him down we'll watch it on replay boy Butler is just a Strider cruises through that secondary Louis Ferguson her point in the dirt Winston number 53 next Sunday football 2nd season starts here on NBC with exclusive coverage of the AFC wild card game the loser goes home while the winner advances in a divisional playoff competition the AFC wild card game following NFL 79 next Sunday here on NBC the call will go against the Steelers here it is from Fred Sousa holy blue mass goes after kaaya he gets out of Bounce top of the crop of him Furguson rolling out he closed they put full smoke on that one and lost anything overs basketball laughs star Worth was voted by his teammates they of a player though Ferguson with third down at 7:00 coming up takes the deep drop stands in pops his arm gets it away intercepted back inside the 25yard line Larry Anderson a secondyear defensive back from Louisiana Tech there he goes off the field is going to keep that ball so with one minute left Pittsburgh has them all back you see Ferguson under very heavy pressure just before the big Steeler defenders came down out on he releases the ball light white almost gets him before he got it away and then right to Anderson he knows where to go with it looking for a touchdown time as he takes up straight ahead but he's knocked down inside the 25yard line of the 24 so Joe Ferguson was that a great season as punched a lot weeks in the recent weeks at one point in the season is quarterback rating was 122 they go to the line and Mosley takes him straight ahead down to the 16 yard line if Nixon makes the knock down second year back to Rhode Island Rick Moser second down and two coming up now for the Pittsburgh Steelers after the 8 yard gain by Moser the Steelers on the sidelines our coaching staff with reason to celebrate as Pittsburgh will be heading it in a playoff with a head of steam corner Anthony Anderson takes it Chuck tax assistance Tom Kaplan Jack Donaldson Steve Nora logic it's ray Prochaska kay Stephenson Jim Wagstaff and Willie Zappa lack the bills will finish the year seven and nine five four three in the kick and the Steelers for a sixth consecutive year when the AFC Central of his entitled another divisional championship for the Steelers as coach Noll goes off decisive victory a 28nothing win after a tough loss Monday night at Houston's and now the Steelers will get a week off they'll not play next Sunday they'll watch the wild card game on NBC and they'll get ready to tee it up right here at Three Rivers Stadium right pop",

  "transcript": "I'm three it's the rookie linebacker out of Michigan State as the man who made the tackle as Turner reached the 21 yard line and there you see an Ohio State backfield Griffin in Johnson with a veteran Anderson and Anderson has healthy sprained his thumb last week against the st. Louis Cardinals didn't practice the first two days of the week but he appears to be fine and a great core of receivers particularly with Curtis back in the fold again Bobby agree totally dot bass is the most consistent receiver has been this season for the Bengals and they slot Archie Griffin on a wing to the lip once set back its Johnson he gets the call the 259 pound for back from Ohio State was met headon by the middle linebacker Jack Lambert and the strong safety Donnie shall no gain on the play and the offensive line particularly the left side where they ran on first down has been very effective for Cincinnati running the ball much better than earlier in the year Wilson and Bush knocked the reason for that also a couple of names there Dave laughs Emmett center was guard and max Montoya he is a rookie out of UCLA starting his second game for the Bengals second down ten yards to go for Kenny Anderson again Griffin goes on the wing to the left bass is slotted to the right not about to the 35yard line that will be good enough for a Cincinnati first down but let us check the marker I think they got Cincinnati for holding yes they did Sam I might mention at the outset of the game that the Cincinnati Bengals have not won here in Three Rivers Stadium and nine tries and as a traveling team in 1979 the Bengals are yet to win their first ballgame they're all in six here is referee Jim Tony holding 77 take down take down Mike Wilson gets credit for two points on the fake down and while you saw referee honey here's the rest of the crew Pat harder is the umpire burl Toller the head linesman Dale Hamer the live judge that night is the back judge dick McKenzie the side judge and Don hates his appeal judge the front floor of Pittsburgh Gunn and Vanna sak will alternate the day with white Infernus every second series they will change it is second down 19 Raiders 20 yard line excellent coverage by Jack ham as the pass was intended again for the tight end Danny Ross Jack am number 59 out of Penn State leads all active receivers in the NFL in interceptions and this gentleman because of the the greatness of the defensive front for the Pittsburgh Steelers he's around the receiver all the time watch the coverage questionable as to whether or not he got to the ball before the reason he got to the receiver but nevertheless it's an incompletion Jack Hammond 220 pounds one of the greatest linebackers ever play the game and the other two aren't bad that he plays with discretion they Lambert and the middle who leads the Steelers and interceptions this season done his job Dennis Winston becomes the fourth linebacker on third and 19 for Anderson throws it out here and it's almost intercepted again he attended the pass for his tight ends and Rossi overthrow him Shalin Ham had the coverage and the Steeler defense gunned up today has done business here on the first offensive series against Cincinnati and so Pat mcanally the third leading punter in the AFC is on to do his thing mcanally averaging 41 nine he led the entire American Football Conference last year with an average of 43 one Sam one of the provinces playing football in this stadium as there always seems to be a wind swirling around and back in Ali's first kick will be a kid step with you saw team Bell momentarily back at the 50 yard line good snap back in alley Oh boobs of beauty into the wind driving Bell to the 43 yard line 15:45 of Cincinnati's got blockers but he's roughed out as he reaches the 42 stopped there by bond lusty number 29 a 45yard punt and a 13 yard return for Bell so the Steelers their first offensive possession of the day they have excellent field position we'll be back with Terry Bradshaw and company in just a moment Berg nice to have you with us Cincinnati in trouble already Robert a good field position by Pittsburgh I brought with me one of the gloves that the players now use in bad weather games you see it's a little thinner than a baseball glove it fits their hand very well does it keep your hand warm but it does keep it from being slippery good gloves to wear on it they like this Sam may I use the prop please yes you may Bradshaw first down whistles all over the place as the ball carrier was Franco Harris but uh hey whistle I think before they ever got started there both sides against Cincinnati encroachment by referee Jim honey let us now establish the offensive unit of the Pittsburgh Steelers they will go with Terry Bradshaw number 12 and quarterback having another great year not quite as good as last year but 22 touchdown passes Rocky Bleier starts for the injured Sidney Thornton although Thornton is available and of course the incomparable Franco Harris is also there so it's first down in five as the Steelers get a gift before even running the play both receivers have split wide to the right Stallworth 82 SWAT 88 harris brought down by Ray Griffin number 44 starting to the right quarterback and that secondary of Cincinnati suspect to say the least well I don't really think you can point the finger at the secondary watch the offensive line blocking 52 Webster on 73 Edwards Rocky Bleier leading on Jim LeClair and Franco Harris's through the line of scrimmage the defensive lineman or at least supposed to slow those running backs down I didn't necessarily mean on that particular play Bob they've had some difficultly there with injury and Riley is out he will not play today here's a pitch to Harris cuts it into the line of scrimmage and reaches the 26 in the grasp of Gary Burley the former University of Pittsburgh allamerican who has come home and middle linebacker Jim LeClair so give him a gain of two will watch Franco stats very closely today because as we told you on our pregame NFL 79 program he's 65 yards away from a thousand and the receiver John Stallworth who now has over a thousand yards and receptions Randy Cunningham Bionic Benny Cunningham healthy against Lynn Swann always an acrobatic gifted receiver and mr. Brancato keep his hands warm indeed Robert second down and eight Bradshaw first pass of the day throws the wide receivers green to Swann and he could not hold on Scott Perry 32 had the coverage but it's an inn completed pass and I think the chills everybody's got him today at least to get started with yeah you're right it takes a little while to get used to the weather out here and the wind will make the ball swirl somewhat good coverage by Cincinnati though I don't think they've gotten a lot of yardage there's the offensive line that when you talk about Pittsburgh their defensive line and their offensive line has been the secret over the years those guys last week 606 total yards of offense whoreson starts from the injured Jerry Mullins today at right guard number 77 third down and a progression yes all day to throw ray Griffin had the coverage but it was overthrown at the 5yard level by Matt Barr who was just brimming with confidence these days he is 8 out of the last nine he's won three games for Pittsburgh including last Sunday's thriller over Cleveland Breen upping Steelers will be back with bars kickoff in a second time of the ballgame this one following a 43yard field goal the wind is blowing the ball off the kicking tee and bar will have to reset it Sam as I remember this is exactly the way the first incident he Pittsburgh game with Steelers went out on front three two right in front three to nothing and then all of a sudden they started turning the ball over and Cincinnati came back you're a hundred percent right the only difference is that their field goal came as a result in the commendeth Winston interception here's thinkin Turner s 2 yard line with a 15 his head into a pilot to 23 yard line and goes down he stopped by Anthony Anderson number 38 and number 39 Rick Mosier start the season off December 15 here on NBC to shut backs Griffin 45 Johnson 46 and Johnson gets the call full but he went down there three of them Lambert blunt and chill were all there it'll take free to bring Pete Johnson down that's one of the big Wagner so there are some changes back there they're great athletes when they've had some problems right at the sack 264 for an S but white white was there to help him on the stunt Steve Furness coming on the outside white white to the inside and one of the problems with having young people play your offensive line position and this is just the second season of Mike Wilson has played in professional football they really don't have the experience in picking up the games that that experience defensive lineman use you got to get away from those guys keep off your quarterback so it's third down and 18 Anderson last series at a third and 19 I don't think Cincinnati's gained a yard yet to possession Sam you may be right there third down efficiency not the best 33% chased out of the pocket looks collects to go out of bounds at the 15 yard line a run out by its white white and so it will be fourth down and Pat mcanally presumably will have to kick it away although there is a discussion going on in the far side of the field and we'll just have to wait until referee Jim Toni straightens this one apparently it's a flag against Pittsburgh because the Cincinnati offense has remained on the field that one I didn't see saying I don't think anybody saw it his referee Jim Toni he knows all about it defensive holding against Robin koln umber 56 the outside linebacker the five yards but more importantly an automatic first down let's look at the pressure again Bob on Anderson Furness I felt that when Ernie Holmes was here Steve Furness was a better defensive line great strength and you see push plan boos knock back and force Kenny out of the pocket but a costly error by Pittsburgh they would have gotten the ball back but Anderson now can recycle the down Bailey's got Ross's ideas at the 30 and blood has to wrestle him out at the 33 hole that's also there but an excellent gain on the pass to the tight end here's our first score of the day Washington on a Joe Theismann to Ricky Thompson pass leads Green Bay 7 up being the Redskins in the thick of the NFC Eastern Division race airs mr. Anderson completing 54 percent of his passes thrown 13 touchdowns and 10 interceptions been sacked 33 times which is Kenny's biggest problem which of course is Cincinnati's biggest problem and that's the head coach in the Bengals so it's his biggest Ron will do demand easily did the throwing Samoan jack choice a third man selected in the 79 draft another first down for Cincinnati and to give this time is and he carries people across the 40 to the 41 yard line ham was there along with Ron Johnson number 29 okay and off the bottom of the pile is the middle linebacker Lambert but Cincinnati now with the help of a penalty is on the movement in tournaments invariably the running right at Joe Green good trap block by clan boos knock Pete Johnson little anxious to get through the line of scrimmage but at 260 pounds he's he's liable to drag a couple of tacklers along he's trying for a thousand yards this season has been a prolific scorer this year 13 touchdowns 12 of them on the ground he is the second as a second touchdown scored Earl Campbell first down it much more for Johnson as he goes across midfield to the Steeler 48 yard line so Cincinnati now starting to put their offense in here and the shuttling guards montoya the rookie ah to UCLA in the bed mark Donahue from Michigan bring in the place from Homer Isaac Pete's got 708 yards so far this season maybe a little but he's alone it's going to Griffon and Johnson remained the setbacks as the plate Cincinnati has kept the st. Mary's so those caught the dawn bass he had single coverage from Mel Blount and it was slightly overthrown by Anderson but the bass made a valiant effort and I would imagine that Cincinnati will try to work on Mel Blount he is a great zone corner but but he's big he's 63 weighs 215 pounds but in mantoman coverage there are a lot of receivers in professional football that are quicker than Mel Blount last week Dave Logan as you said earlier Sam took advantage of Melvin a couple of times and earlier this year at Cleveland Dave Logan scored two touchdowns against Mel Blount but he's been a great one over the years second down ten curtisha's wife left fast at the bottom of your screen and dad in the grasp of flooded ham but not before little Archie Griffin the twotime Heisman Trophy winner got the first down and he is catching the ball this year better than at any time in his life he's the second leader receiver on the Cincinnati Bengals and he's a young man who you can't put his heart at this stadium Sam he wants to be the best running back tourism to business came out of college the last eight Pittsburgh and the crowd here 50,000 strong starts to light it up Griffin breaks a tackle the 30yard line look at the great effort by Archie Griffin the numbertwo rusher and the number two receiver on the Cincinnati squad he is within a half yard of another Cincinnati first down at 518 185 pounds there's Chuck no he watched the first Cincinnati Bengal Pittsburgh Steeler game he saw a rare sight Chuck no absolutely infuriated at his team turning the ball over and hanging their heads on the sidelines and I think it was the heat father day more than the turnovers second down weston er they line up in the I formation for the first time today and they give it to the Outback Johnson first down as he reaches the 36 yard line robbing coal is a man who made the stop you know who's doing some great blocking up front is Dave lap of the converted guard who's been forced to play center because Blair Bush went down fact that bagels were so desperate to get somebody at center they've brought back there their first firstever draft choice my roommate for 10 years with the Cincinnati Bengals bio Johnson who if he has to play center will be doing it 26 Cincinnati got a break on a third down play in which they did not get a first down Robyn whoa to peel this one is caught at the 20yard line by Griffin it'll be a gain of about six on the place second down in for so Anderson has mixed the run in the past very well and as he always has done that particularly against Pittsburgh has gone to his backs and Sam I mentioned earlier that Pittsburgh's offense last week against Cleveland had 606 yards there's one way to neutralize that keep the ball for a long time we've got it second down they are within range for Chris Barra ready to tie at Pittsburgh leads three nothing Johnson we'll about the 18yard line stacked up there by Joe Greene 75 he needs no introduction I'm sure at the bottom of the pile so it'll be shy of the first down Steve Furness was also there it'll be third down in about two for Cincinnati to keep this drivable you know this Pittsburgh Steeler football team seemed to turn around with the draft choice of of Joe green back in 1968 that was the one person that really solidified their defense there's home arrives with Chris Barr older brother Kris bargain to do his thing and answer his brothers field goal intended receiver Griffen her Johnson it is Jack ham had the coverage and was there with Pete and so it's fourth down and Chris bar will now attempt the field goal he is 11 out of 19 on the year and doesn't want to be shown up by his little brother I'm sure especially in front of father right sure they'll spot the ball at the 27 yard line it'll be a kick of 37 yards for Chris Barr steve writer on the whole the place public is no snap try to juggle the snap from center had trouble putting it down so the score remains three nothing Chris bar has misses his brother Matt watches on the sidelines no telling what his emotion is will return to Three Rivers Stadium in a moment wait did you see what they did to my car but the card oboe we went back to the drawing boards we wanted to get the gas mileage up but not at the expense of the style introducing that totally redesigned Chrysler Cordoba all the luxury you expect is here but so is gas mileage you can't have high style and good mileage the new Cordova proves I like what they've done to my car by a Cordoba now at participating dealers get a $300 check direct from Chrysler do you know me playing football sure but my name comes up zero in English rugby so when I travel I carry their American Express car and even if I fumble and lose it they'll give me another card fast usually the next business day lose the card and I'm protected you can lose your life in there to apply for a card look for this display wherever the card is welcomed Carrie Bradshaw they got three points out of their first run from his whole 20yard line Rocky Bleier for the 26 brought down by Ross browner now next Sunday we invite you to see a dynamite doubleheader featuring exciting regional action from around the league followed by the Browns versus the Raiders from the Oakland Alameda Coliseum that Bob and I will have the pleasure of doing that one next Sunday afternoon we invite you to check your local listings more than games and times in your area what an air show that might be in Oakland uh Brian Sipe vs. Ken Stabler the essence second down for this is Franco pitbull gets the first down Cambron the linebacker is a man who made the stop along with LeClair and Glen Cameron has had to play today for the injured Reggie Williams as we look at that Cincinnati defense the front floor is intact but the rest is patchwork those four gentleman right there began the season is the real strong point of the Cincinnati because the linebackers top nickel replacing Reggie Williams out with knee surgery LeClair harris good linebacker first down from the 31 a Pittsburgh Steelers stay on the ground pittsburg I think got it back Stallworth number 82 was out blocking recovered the fumble after blyer picked up nine yards and I think the fumble recovery and able to have to get the first down is a great block by Franco Harris but you'll see it's cold Greg Griffin putting his head in there the ball is loose and stallworth johnnyonthespot he can drive alive and that's the problem the pittsburgh steelers have had they lead the league in turnovers 49 I believe waters have I think the knower is a difference does it make you're right Bob they lead the entire NFL he tried to get it out in the flat but Wilson Whitley got a hand on it in Bradshaw kind of nonchalant that pass and I got a feeling the cold is really bothering him Bob he's played in worse weather though I can assure you but he does look cold watch Webster 52 on Wilson Whitley 75 passed off to Sam Davis number 75 of 57 and a jump ball and Whitley almost got back to pick it up he did second down according to the Steelers needed three nothing now the library thought of Sam Cincinnati was in a pledge trying to get in to get his hands up and once Wan got the ball there was nobody there the only people that were there were the cornerback and the same thing they had three linemen out in front you can see the Blitz by Bo Harris and there's nobody left warning is gone 58 yards and a touchdown and they can do it that quickly 80yard Drive and only the third touchdown reception of the year for Lynn Swann 80 yards four plays elapsed time two minutes in a second Matt Barr will attempt to make it 10 nothing and he did so the Steelers strike with lightning as a flag is down on the play and they're being called back on the PLS see whether or not it is against Pittsburgh it is indeed so far we'll have to do it again holding on an extra point well I think what they probably called was the guy on the outside hooking holding putting his arm out there to try to keep the outside rush man away from the kicker but a 10 yards he'll try to do it again now it becomes a mini field goal here's such a honey holding 56 that's the outside man well obviously we're having difficulty with the referees Mike we apologize for that where's those microphones that don't belong to us we wouldn't have those kinds of problems they belong to the National Football League bar we'll have to try 30yard extra point got a col quits hold it's down it up perfect so challenged a bit mr. Parr responds with a 30yard extra point he's having a nice day his brother hasn't enjoyed it yet can nothing Pittsburgh as you look at the tail end of Lynne swans 52 yard touchdown reception against Cincinnati we'll be back you give a man a cup from the 32 yard line first down and Johnson on the sweep again and may have gotten the yard and here's our first score from down the Turnpike Brian Sipe a 42 yard pass to Mike Pruitt the Cleveland Browns lead the Houston Oilers 7 nothing Sam Rutigliano screw has not quits yet the cardiac kids up there in Cleveland they are amazing they extended this football team the Pittsburgh Steelers to the end took them 74 minutes and 51 seconds to beat the Cleveland Browns last week with a field goal and remind me after this play I have a question ask you Robert about that situation second down and nine a gain of 1 he's led this team in rushing every year he's been extensive he tried to throw the swing pass to Pete Johnson who I don't believe was looking at well put absolutely Sam Pete Johnson never turned her on to look at the quarterback and you don't have all day to throw it back there against the Pittsburgh Steelers Joe green got him number 75 it'll be third and long into question Bob what about that extra period for Pittsburgh doesn't take its toll in this game or later in the year or Never no I think it takes a toll on the next game maybe not physically but emotionally I think those players were very very Pittsburgh Steelers had to come back they're probably down a little dirt Winston has gone into the fortified stealing vowels and finally gets out just before he got hit by dirt Winston but you may have heard Bob holler Pete Johnson is open but Anderson apparently didn't see him but one of the things you do as a receiver you practice watch the defensive coverage here an extra defensive back in there there's not too many open but you'll see Pete Johnson come into the open right there he's open but Kenny Anderson would have had to throw back to cross his body chose to run it anyway fourth down and about 12 yards to go Cincinnati has done well so far except for the one drive McAnally the poor year veteran out of Harvard set to punt back at his 15yard line kicking the tee Bell 13 yards on Belle's first return of the day fair catch here at the 35 yard line and that's where Pittsburgh will go to work let's quickly switch to Bryant Gumble in New York by a 25yard line on first down following the McAnally pot Bradshaw through to his back out of the backfield beau Harris 53 and Marvin Cobb made to stop but a big first down there that's one of the changes in the Pittsburgh Steelers offense last week Franco Harris got nine passes from Terry Bradshaw and this is the first year that I can ever remember Pittsburgh really going to their backs that much rocky wire had seven cuts they don't tell you why mom because linebackers in San Diego dropped 20 yards deep to double cover the receivers and the only thing they gave Bradshaw was the pastor Harris running laterally or lost a couple of yards dick Jerrod as a man who ran him down but the reason he's had to go to his backs is because of the linebacker coverage from both Cleveland and San Diego the week before well we were honest with the salmon as a former player against these guys for 10 years it's difficult to figure out how to beat this football team this is one of the best teams ever assembled I think in professional football of the 45 players 39 or draft choices six or free agents it was handbuilt by mr. Chuck know Philadelphia Eagles have gone Detroit 7lv the Eagles could smell a tiny the NFC Eastern Division up for grabs Philadelphia Dallas Washington they are all there second down and 12 for Bradshaw coverage by Scott Barry who slipped down lynn swann when he has to can run with the football number 88 out of USC and who can ever forget the game he had at Super Bowl 13 watch this brokenfield running deuteronomist tackle number 30 Barbour job is next good blocking by his fellow receivers downfield Stallworth Rocky Bleier number 20 finally spilling out of bounds by Ray Griffin number 44 first and 2 to go for another six points fairness to Scott Perry he's played out of position he normally is a free safety having to play quarterback first down and goal to go from the two oh it's Franco maybe the yard haven't pushed back 79 is Ross Crowder and also number 51 Tom rude and Houston is answered sites touchdown with one of their own Earl Campbell 11 the yard run and so the Oilers and Browns are knotted at 7 and remember salmon Cleveland loses in Houston lose it and Pittsburgh wins Pittsburgh's in the playoffs for sure no signal II may have reached the goal line but there is no signal from the officials that's probably the warmer spot on the field right there say I'm underneath all those heavy bodies well I got a run a hundred yards down out of the other end of the field because we have completed one quarter here at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh and the Steelers by virtue of a fat bar field goal in a 58 yard pass from fried Bradshaw to Swan lead at 10 nothing we'll be right back after these messages from your local station yard pittsburgh already leading 10 nothing perhaps looking for the early blowout fran\u00e7a touchdown interesting play Randee gross the number 84 lamp away and Franco went right over his back into the end zone 63 yards six plays two minutes and 17 seconds and it's interesting that they bring Randy Grossman in the block at six to 215 pounds if any Cunningham stays on the bench you see Grossman on the trap for the nose man Wilson Whitley Mike Webster pulls Franco Harris soon so Matt Barr will attempt to make it 17 dumping out of the Colquitt whole bar has had himself a nice day couple of extra points and a field goal while his brother watches from the other end of the field ready to receive it for the third time with the Steelers leading 70 nothing you saw the great run by Campbell the snow has started to fall in Cleveland Turner at the 13 yard line 25 bricks this one out over the 30 to the 34yard line and so Kenny Anderson goes to work with some decent field position stop there by tee bell number 83 you know NBC Sports we feel we've got the best of bowl games for you beginning Christmas Day the Fiesta Bowl the Panthers of Pittsburgh battle Arizona then New Year's Day the Buckeyes of Ohio State take on Charles White and the USC Trojans in the granddaddy of the ball the Rose Bowl then the undefeated Florida State Seminoles faced Billy Sims and the Oklahoma Sooners that will be in the orange ball to Miami coming your way here on NBC first down has a man white into Pittsburgh territory at the 45 had finally brought down by Jack Heil but a big Cincinnati first down as they move the ball one of the tags against the Bengals offensive line has been not allowing Kenny Anderson enough time to pass the ball here you see 75 Joe green mark Donahue 66 doing a great job on it you're doing a heck of a job on it Kenny gets time to throw the football that's foosh doc helping out the completion the lesson stores for you right after this play Grimpen the deep back for a couple of yards to the 43 the Green Bay Packers have come back to tie up Washington 77 you see the game we've been covering very closely Houston and Cleveland the Bears on a Walter Payton run lead Tampa Bay seven nothing move three three Baltimore in the New York Jets and Philly still leads Detroit seven nothing we gave you that score early they have gone to the second quarter Denver on a chip turner field goal over Buffalo he in the snow and rich Stadium boy our crew had a difficulty getting into that city who feet of snow in Buffalo and Al in Dickey touchdown pass Green Bay has tied Washington you are up to date a 70 nothing Steelers here Manolis got a maid at the 33yard line again is tight end and Ross they are fighting for the ball and they give it to the offense Doni shell is not happy very seldom is tough football player that downhill dhanraj second round draft choice out of northeastern good pass receiver you see he has control of the football and with Donnie shell tries to wrestle from him going to the ground they're always going to give that to the offense first down now for Cincinnati something about the is only touchdown pass of the year and River Stadium Cincinnati against the Steelers she'll had the coverage but it was Ross again and Bob is there anything significant about the fact that Anderson is now thrown to Danny Ross six times today no I think one of the things you're noticing here is that Pittsburgh is going a lot more to the Blitz so they run the two wide receivers deep throw to the tight end underneath that's just good football there's nothing wrong with that that's well thought out that's the way you're going to gain a lot of yards against Pittsburgh always thought it was interesting that Cincinnati passed Kellen Winslow because they felt they would get an equal tiny into the second round and Bing and Ross alive and well in San Diego 8 just be the best frozen overthrows Isaac Curtis and he had Kurt Curtis wide open Isaac it put a pretty good fake on Ronnie Johnson making the cornerback think he was going deep had made the sidelines cut and mystery mad at himself I do believe on our heat overthrow him a great deal max Montoya number 65 coming in with the play from the sideline offensive coordinator Mike mcCormick Boyd up over rice calling the plays on the sidelines for linebacker Eastern Winston again from the outside found shy of the first down as he went out of the 28 yard line so Kenny Anderson scrambling for five comes up five short it'll be fourth down in five yards to go and Chris Barr I believe is on his way and will attempt second field goal of the day here's Jack ham on the Blitz trying to fake Pete Johnson out that's Archie Griffin Noah watch Pete Johnson now watch Jack ham great speed of 220 pounds trying to get a glove on Ken Anderson but still not enough yardage for the first down 49 yard it's hypocrisy Barr he has four out of seven over 40 yards very strong leg and he has been incredibly accurate long distances he's got this one nailed it is good a 49yard field goal by Chris Baro missed a considerably shorter one earlier in the game so the 16 isn't for him it's for his brother Matt a place in the other side I can't ever can tell that might be the bar family putting it up there rooting for both sons difficult for the family to choose which one if they really care for the most right wrong I think that is a bad bar fan what's a good try anyway Bob I suppose if the sign were orange and white yes yes it would be for Chris so Chris bar after a 49yard field goal kicking deep here Anthony Anderson is the man in the middle for Pittsburgh and he has the ball in his seven yard he goes right on the 30yard line NBC sports world salutes the champions of 79 will review the many magic moments with an exciting look in the ears major events from Swan Super Bowl to Stargell series and more do not miss sports year 79 a salute to the champions coming up Saturday December 22nd on NBC sports world sounds like an all Pittsburgh show with Swan and Stargell the yes they've changed the name of the Steel City the championship city here in Pittsburgh and it's a little tough to deal with your when you're in Cincinnati yes I guess from the 30yard line both wide receivers is bitlevel Franco Harris for five in the 37 yard line brought down there by Jimmy browner the younger brother of defensive end ross browner so harris moving inexorably to the 65 yard mark for the day which will get up to a thousand and 67 yards is bob told you earlier will make him the fourth leading rusher in the history of the National Football the ilding frog over show the jet Barry and three of those rushers wore number 32 interesting Brown ships in it that Franco Harris and Jim Taylors the other one still ahead of him he was 31 the play was not designed to go to stallworth but he was wide open for the first time today Bradshaw through to number 82 and his Swan bid on his first attempt he dropped it one of the problems with playing at cold weather Sam is that at times as a receiver you try to catch the ball at your body the ball is not touched by Ray Griffin I don't believe he touches well he may have touched a little bit but you should try to catch the football with your hands he yes he did touch it he changed the rotation on the football you can see it yes he did touch it good play by Ray Griffin can't blame John Stallworth for that one amazing win a replay and do to vindicate somebody up yes 11:28 to go first to have 17 3 Steelers and Bradshaw Watts more flyer at the 40yard line Jim LeClair had the coverage so it's fourth down and Creek Colquitt out to do the punting for the Steelers the first time today they've had to punt the ball away last week Rocky Bleier seven receptions against the Cleveland Browns and mr.

Perry and single coverage on Swann Bob you got me all I can tell you is a couple of weeks ago the defensive backs of the Cincinnati Bengals were somewhat somewhat critical of the coach is calling single coverage but they had so many new guys back there I don't understand 25 years one of the up men how it turn to catch it was Howie kurtik Elana touched down with a fumble recovery in the first Pittsburgh Cincinnati game of the year and he brings it back to shy of the 30 NBC Sports well we got the best of bull games beginning Christmas day it's the Fiesta Bowl Tempe Arizona the Pitt Panthers against Arizona the New Year's Day the Buckeyes of Ohio State take on Charles white and the USC Trojans that's the granddaddy of them all in the Rose Bowl then the undefeated Florida State Seminoles they love to throw the ball against Billy Sims and oak Oh yes Oh 250 choppiness he's got ten or eleven strides of movement going for excellent tackle by Cole he lost it too intercepted by Cole Alexandra the intended receiver but cold and him double Pittsburgh excuse me since Annette they're cool stay with game plan as best they possibly can and it always seems to be the case that once that momentum shifts once something positive happens for Pittsburgh everybody gets excited their defense plays very very well you know you've got to go back a few years to find three games in a row with the Steelers at two points Bob Alexander is out Steve Ryder becomes the third receiver who's have the nickel defense third down to 12 Anderson Randall dumps it off a onehanded catch by Pete Johnson not bad good catch but it didn't do him any good as he did not even the line of scrimmage and on fourth down Pat McAnally will have to kick it away but it's interesting that the Steeler defense has given up 35 in San Diego 30 against Cleveland 17 here today against Cincinnati when a quarter to half to play tea bell standing back in his 35 yard line awaiting this putt from Pat back Adele and he blooms in the run at the 3003 yard was Holly nine so the Steelers have it back again see bradshaw's out there's nothing he does someone list all these this list a stiff small net oh you can call it mulch and you can call regret choice its name the differences best of everything that we put together because Christ engineers would be sold on the car they find butts other people along but news for you it's sticker price more like a Knowles 98 or Buick Electra if you buy any hook consider be too bad both of us bye Annie 300 this is the NBC television network your Steeler station hello 11a ictv pittsburgh back in Ali's last putt 46 yards seven on the return Sam Dover and Bob grumpy in Pittsburgh with that score the ste by 14 bradshaw going to work from it two yard line where the tape that Rosa did field SWAT is all alone at the 45 and dragged down by Scott Perry but mr. Perry has insulted a college battle is back and off to a flying start ray Myers to Paul team plays the powerful UCLA Bruins a rematch of their 79 NCAA Western Regional final coming your way today 3:30 Eastern Time December 15 14th on NBC football producer today George Finkel will be there for them tell ray Meyer as I said hello as he crosses the 45 to the 47 yard line LeClair and Whitley combined to make a stock ill the mismatch or rather the matchup that we talked about in that the Cincinnati Pittsburgh game earlier this year Bob Whitley against Webster has not been much of a factor today at least one that we can no webone youth the ability for the hole and wait for the blocking to materialize until I am with Chuck Brown and he's doing it in eight years it took to crowd 9 and 14 yards to get Franco liscus Rocky Bleier down to the 39 yard line and now to use mr. Harris as a decoy I think the bengals realize that they want to get him the record here today and they got to be keying on Franco Baraka you ran with it sure absolutely little cross bucks something about 40 years ago used to be very common in football wire is one of those guys in the matter how many times you give it to him he's gonna give me 120% Steelers in the Cincinnati 40yard line they leave by 14 trying to regain that twenty one point lead here's Franco sure and he has got over a thousand yards for the seventh time listen to this crowd and to think when he went to Penn State he was a blocking back Mitchell radical thing is that during that draft the Steeler coaching staff couldn't decide whether to take Franco or Robert Newhouse 16 carries 87 yards number 32 so the drama has finally come to Three Rivers Stadium for Franco Harris accepting the congratulations and in turn giving it to the people who have paved the way for his incredible recordsetting performance will return to Three Rivers with the Steelers leading by 14 and looking for more in just a moment beautiful picture I didn't always fly my own flying home from the church Arnold Palmer back again in Latrobe Pennsylvania I had to do a lot of driving on a lot of roads in my early years as a pro so I didn't need car troubles well I just remembered what I had learned from my dad about Pennzoil and you know since then Pennzoil and I have been down a lot of roads together Pennzoil America's repeat again has gone over a thousand yards for the seventh time he and Jim Brown are the only people who ever do that fourth leading rusher alltime passing Joe the jet Perry and ahead of him live Jim Brown OJ Simpson Jim Taylor first and goal to go on the Cincinnati 5 I think a very young man I was going to start playing football and ask for number 32 if I was are running back because three of the four guys who have to the top guarding to the NFL were war 32 OJ Simpson Jim Brown and now Franco Harris Jim Taylor was 31 he was very close to it he asked for 32 but it wasn't available they got the Green Bay get the scores together Robert if you will and we'll check in right after this play six yard line Steelers now with their roast for the Petersons Benny Cunningham Bradshaw rolling right Grossman had a handout of the good coverage by Scott Perry so the Steelers from run formation throw the football Bobby run to scores there you are in Cleveland in the snow bowl 77 third quarter scores remained the same since halftime Chicago over Tampa Bay Tampa Bay is still trying to win the NFC Central the Jets over Baltimore 20 to three in the third Philadelphia ah they're going to win the NFC East 27 shutting out Detroit the goal to go up to Cincinnati 6 Bradshaw with his receivers in there throws it a little high for Swan the coverage from Cobb and Perry and it's fourth down and Matt Barr is trying to get the Steelers three points here Chuck Noll is not happy about that particular play they had a first and goal at the 5 watch this play for the endzone the defense really has an advantage here when they're this close to the goal line because they don't have that much yardage to cover therefore it's tough to get in but Lynn Swann was open Terry Bradshaw just threw it too hard so Colquitt will spot the ball in the 13 yard line this is a 23 yard field goal attempt by Matt Carr placement the kick is up and it is perfect that young man has really come on strong he is made good now 9 of his last 10 field goal attempts 68 yard drive and 9 plays they get three points out of it and I remind you that tonight on NBC the world favorite movie and winner of five Academy Awards Julie Andrews Christopher Plummer in the sound of music followed by an exclusive look at legal clinics and a man who helped to help on primetime Sunday with Tom Schneider both of those gang Buster shows coming your way starting at 7:00 Eastern Time tonight here on NBC they have some stats for you Bradshaw 14 to 21 280 yards and Lynn Swann has caught five passes for 191 yards however they did not get a touchdown in a touchdown situation well they got excited about Franco gaining a thousand yards I think coach Noll might label that a distraction a distraction distraction from the business at hand of course Franco deserved the plaudits and Chuck Noll be the first to give it to him but it did take away from the drive and the Steelers having a great chance to get seven out of it end up with three and they lead it here 34 7 with exactly 210 to go in the third quarter eris on the sidelines his bar kicks at deep field of air by Deacon Turner 2530 she's a couple of people a yard line sack balance on the rookie out of East Carolina and Larry Anderson combine to make the stop as you see Franco paced the sidelines knowing that he is now the fourth leading rusher of all time three folks ahead of him I don't know if you'll play long enough Jim Brown I'm sure he will I'm sure he will he does so many things good and of course the offensive line of the Pittsburgh Steelers should each get a ball for the thousand yard seasons at Franco Harris his head still tied in the port look in Cleveland and gone to the fourth quarter he had to struggle who would recycle passion and Campbell's running chuckled Alexander has forty Aries a man to the 45yard line Donnie shale and Mel Blount put him down but a first down as Charles Alexander juggles but caught the football is it possible that Cleveland could have their second straight overtime Game one here that went all but nine seconds of the overtime period last year two years ago they called him the cardiac Cardinals a st. Louis ballclub it seemed to go down to the final minute or so every game and this year it's Cleveland I think Cleveland has had six overtime games in the last two years first down and 45 and Anderson try to bring his team right back again here's a draught Alexander it's five six maybe seven sinners moved amid estilo territory Alexander coming your way in it's almost intercepted they got Cincinnati for illegal motion towards the line of scrimmage Charles Alexander rookie mistake good eyes Bob a legal procedure against Cincinnati Alexander starting toward the line of scrimmage scrimmage before the snap and let's see whether the Steelers elect to take the play or the penalty if they decline it it'll be third down in four if they take it of course second down and nine talking to mr. Joe green there is referee Jim honey with the announcement well it is an Alexander at all it was number 85 Isaac Curtis and again I apologize for the league's microphone that doesn't seem to be working today and we also apologize for pointing the finger at Charles Alexander shame on us Alexander comes out Steve Ryder 86 three wide receivers formation with one setback quarterback keeper by Anderson Chris dad of the 35 the old quarterback Fras he took one step back and then tucked in in behind his Center Dave Lapham and gained big yardage the Steeler 34 yard good call what they did wasn't with the three wide receivers you see Donnie shale here with three right wide receivers Lambert has covers on one of those backs out of the backfield shale trying to make the tackle mr. Anderson knows when to duck discretion the better part of valor look for alive well a total yard out of the crash of 75 Jill green the head of originally he got out of bed his axe grass the green was there to put him down Vanna sak was left with his shoe you get a corner sack for that look in the quarter okay once again from behind Joe green look at the muscle he uses and you see Banias sack and Joe green Benton SEC hits the shoe Green gets the sack doesn't seem fair get three for them today yes I believe you're a third shot gifted woman ears also Cleveland now leads Houston 14 to 7 with the turn back here about two hours thirty five thirty and close to a first down as he reaches a 27 yard line the Anderson is scrambled very well with the football today Bob one of the things that he's done throughout his entire career he's a very good runner he's been injured seriously running the ball but he still got the nerve to do it you'll see a good block here by clan boos knock knocking done off of Anderson and he picks up almost enough prefers that we can lower down in about one and a half of the Bengals continue to drive there it is backers for job soon as he gets inside the 20 just inside Alexander in the backfield almost intercepted right in the hands of Lambert whoops he disgustedly spikes the football and if he had been able to hold on it would have been his 7th of the year he currently leads all linebackers in the AFC with six interceptions I'm not mistaken spiking the football like that is supposed to be a penalty I don't think you're mistaken but no flag is down so he got away with it yeah I noticed them anyways Jack Lambert looks to George perlis the defensive genius in the Pittsburgh Steelers for the same second down thirtyfour buckle up excellent pressure from the front for the fifth sack of the day for the Steelers and it couldn't come at a more opportune third down big play here and throws it out the Johnson dad at the 12 he'll be doing us know stealer assistant under Chuck Noll has ever gone on to a head job as my Knowles great success once beat Johnson here run against good heavyweight running up through the middle and the Bengals are going for it 4,000 money's on Johnson interference they got the first down it's going to be interference on Ron Johnson and I think it's designed that way Isaac Curtis and Johnson collided at about the 5yard line and there you see referee Jim tani signal it'll be an automatic first down I wouldn't be a bit surprised if that's exactly the way the players design throw it whether he's open or not hope for contact within the first five yards I think Chuck is complaining too that that was probably a design play and he was within the fiveyard limit here five yards unfortunately Chuck knows mic work works better than mr. Toney's money maybe it's coming off mr. Johnny's mic and you have to speak from ten yards away you could have heard perhaps an old hollering to referee honey he wasn't five yards from the line of scrimmage though when the ball is thrown there could be no contact between defensive and offensive receive here's Johnson to the three Johnson one and a half and then shove back by cold and done and everybody else the Steeler defense is not if Rob Thompson covers in the anchovy Steelers thwart the drive some of this dealers hang in there 68 yards six minutes is 30 seconds and that's what it ends up as Ron Johnson on the fumble recovery Pittsburgh dies is a bullet here we go again tor Johnson would not have into the end zone on that carry Cincinnati still had a fourth down last night I assured if credit to flood in Lambert who both helped the stand Johnson up at the oneyard line and what a horse of bumble Franco three yards and gumba limba gentlemen second down seven rats y'all looking for more at the 45 Greenwich Sean ducked under a doubleteam back in the ten yard line he got away good presence by Bradshaw always been one of the strongest quarterbacks the NFL I'm not sure what that means the block hoody baby huh the other Chuck donut heaven control that you'll see the good pressure by Cincinnati but he keeps a good presence in those where everybody is Rocky Bleier is kind of forgot 75 Wilson Whitley forgets him but then he throws a kind of a bear catch pass up there flyers waiting for it there's the reception carbon copies have been here sure just as I said Bradshaw was throw an interception early got a hand on it as he deflected that away from the intended receiver out of the flat they had set up the screen here's the score 1st quarter Ray Wersching a 23 yard field goal San Francisco leads the st. Louis Cardinals 3 nothing sam terry bradshaw just got over 300 yards of passing for the third time this season last week was the second time against cleveland and of course he threw for over 300 in Super Bowl 13 against Dallas so technically in 1979 he's done it four times second down and ten at the 45 in Pittsburgh whoops that'll be offside Pittsburgh Rocky Bleier who does not make mistakes they say Jim LeClair is the man who made the stop on the ball carrier Franco Harris they're hanging on for dear life now all they can hope for is that by having to lose a New England win receivers flags are down they have a free play to Stallworth his first catch of the day he fumbles the ball but after the whistle and if the play goes it'll be a Steeler first down and Stallworth has his first catch of the day that makes 62 for John Stallworth in receptions Burley offsides declined by Pittsburgh they'll take the play on the first down of the Cincinnati 39 Greg Landry has thrown a touchdown pass to Glenn dowdy 15 yards the Jets still needed by 10 27:17 New York over Baltimore first down Pittsburgh into Cincinnati 39 they are on the move again Bradshaw throws a quick pass down by swan with one hand scott mhairi had the coverage on lynn who's had his greatest day ever as far as total the origins concerned receiving the football 198 yards not bad so the clock stops with 829 to go here in the fourth quarter the Steelers can really put the icing on the cake yeah that would make sense in a tscore three touchdowns and the great day put the ball up to Bradshaw he seems to really thrive on inclement weather I think one of his best games ever was the championship inside handoff to about the 35 yard line Steelers getting cute with a 17 point lead and don't quite understand that well interesting that a team that is this far ahead yeah and also with the offensive power they have go to a play like that but what it does is it puts it in the bill next week they play Houston Houston has to drop at the bench to stop that they got a watch for Rocky Bleier for the week back running to the reverse when your head by that many points you can do that I knew there was a reason that I knew you knew I'm not sure 61 yards Cary's for Rocky Bleier today it is third down and six of a Pittsburgh thirty five three wide receivers again again when Fran Shaw has missed today and he has not missed that often he has missed hi great timing pass though Bradshaw threw that ball before Jim Smith that even turned around he's mad at himself repeated if he had thrown it thrown it just the right height thing we would have caught a watch Bradshaw's reaction oh darn do it walk down what's he saying golly d'arnot alley dog threw a shoe has holy cow that's the extent of his language Philadelphia has scored again so has Detroit the Eagles have a laugher today they gotta play the Giants later on this afternoon northbound at six and the Steelers will go for the first down forward maybe more rubbing it in Bradshaw stepping up in the pocket throws it too high but Scott Perry who is birth burned all day same exact formations same exact play only this time Terry Bradshaw is true about two feet lower and Jim Smith could make the reception best Adair you see Bradshaw same exact way looks to the strong side to the double receiver set then right back the Jim Smith he catches it this time now what is Bradshaw say now that's where I wanted it the last time there's 50% for that blade worthless and it was on a Mars field goal range even if they didn't get it Cincinnati would have to go 65 yards he goes very hard at the 9 yard line and his offensive line mates are there to see that he's all right Steve coarsened hovering over him Eddie Edwards made the stop I'm not sure exactly what happened here everyone was kind of standing around you see Bradshaw look downfield it's not a design play that's a broken play big cheer went up with Sidney for numbers came into the game in Rocky Bleier Tina Pharisee flyer next to Chuck Noll and Sidney Thornton who has been out the last three games with his great ankle makes his first appearance of this young man has had a great first half of the season for the Steelers hey where's number 38 Harris gets to call no game by jackal by Wilson Whitley 75 right on the 10yard line the Browns continue to lead Houston 14 to 7 fourth quarter and if Cleveland can win that game they will go to 9 and 5 on the year and it's funny Sano people here know is that they're tied with Houston and they want to beat Houston for the es Central Division title third down and eight Anderson did earlier right at the pitchers bahu and he's hurt he is hurt I'm sure we've got this one again hopefully this is right at the pitcher's mound where John Candelaria makes his living I think Bradshaw just fell on his elbow with some weight on him I think you'll see him catch his foot in the insert for the pitcher's mound watch closely or see if you catch Bradshaw catching his foot in that pitcher's mound no he'd know he does it right from the start it looks like Webster stepped on his foot a little bit and Webster backs over him and then Ross browner falls on it that Baker is a field goal attempt by Matt Barr 32 yarder it's good so far three out of three today ten out of his last 11 and his daddy is sitting up somewhere here Three Rivers enjoying it while Pratt Shaw suffers in pain on the sidelines with the Steelers lead by 20 points with more 58 to play the first 80 blow to the Pittsburgh Steelers if he has hurt his wrist badly hopefully it's not so but marvelous recuperative powers over the years oh I'll tell you I've seen him suffer some more serious injuries than that Bob and come back the next week in fact this year they carried him off on a stretcher in the second quarter at st. Louis as you look at Mike ruzek warming up on the sidelines backup quarterback they carried him off on a stretcher with a with a twisted ankle and he came back to star in the third fourth quarter and lead to Steelers to victory here's the kickoff Deacon Turner at the 9 yard line 1520 he goes into 22 yard line Dennis Winston number 53 is the man who knocked him out I guess a lot of people out there wondering why leading 34:17 you don't take your call your starting quarterback out earlier mom it's an obvious question I'm not sure I understand why they left him in the football game I mean they're leading at the time they were leading 34 to 17 if they're looking for total points within a division to settle a tiebreaker maybe that's possible but I don't think it has to go that far but it is somebody is going to ask mr. Knoll exactly why Terry Bradshaw was in there well I'll tell you one of the reasons and he leaves his first team people in there and I'll tell you right after this first down for Kenny Anderson down by 20 points at the 42 yard line five Don Bosch number 84 and a first down for Cincinnati Chuck dole has had a philosophy ever since 1973 when his team let Sandy Eagle 38 nothing at the half but he took all his first stringers out and Sandy Eagle came back and scored 21 unanswered points that when you take your first team people out it's like hey we've won the game and everybody can rest on their laurels and invariably is give up a lot of points or he doesn't like to do that well now wait a minute there's a difference for you between taking all your first drink people on and taking your starting quarterback you take a starting quarterback and it's like waving a flag we've won the game we don't start anymore there is only 404 lat at this point he Johnson in the flat out of bound to the 45yard line he's garage Josh now leaving the football field as you can see there and we'll head to the Steeler dressing room with under four minutes to play in regulation time his right wrist that they can ill afford to have Terry Bradshaw hurt this week next week they play Houston 339 yards today they need him desperately dick Koch is the offensive backfield coach he just had a word with him as he passed him on the sidelines another very impressive statistical day for Terry Bradshaw second down at seven Cincinnati yours Anderson passing on every day Madeline it's almost caught by Johnson Lauren caves had the coverage 51 and Bradshaw goes down the tunnel into the dressing room 3rd down at 7 now Jimmy Corbett seen some action he is a familiar name to Pittsburgh fans because he played his college ball at the University of Pittsburgh now in his third year at 6 4 to 17 where's number 81 suffered a separated shoulder earlier this season was on the injured reserve for several weeks there's Mike ruzek he will be the next quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers from the 45 yard line Cincinnati trailing 3717 all day throws it out here it's caught by Corbett for the first minute at the 45 and it takes two or three people to bring him down and Corbett and Johnson squaring off red Joe the reporters will have some xrays taken on that injured right wrist and if we get a report and I doubt if we will before the end of this game we'll pass it along to you Steelers were favored in this game Bob by 14 points so a Cincinnati score here please do some damage to what the good jets out there that drops at the 38 yard line Kenny Anderson has thrown the Bell quite well today it has been under some constant pressure the New York Jets got a field goal from David Jacobs 42 yards listen Tony Linhart kicking for the New York Jets for a while is that mr. Irsay's friend Robert Irsay the guy who gave him a $10,000 raise then cutting fired him up second down at 10 the ball is in the 45 Pittsburgh under three minutes to play now lots of high one Madonn bass and he threw it for bass although bash may have run the wrong pattern because Mel Blount was the closest to the football Bryant Gumbel and Mike Adamle gathering scores and highlights of all the games around the National Football League will have the finals for you that are available and the partials on the others NFL report follows our broadcast as you look at Homer rice to Cincinnati coach Sam the report out of Cleveland is two minutes to go into ballgame Houston is on their own 42 trailing Cleveland 14 to 7 three wide receivers Deacon Turner is out a third man at ten and the lone setback is Pete jumps steena trying to get some pressure now and down he goes he reaches the 32 yard line and another Cincinnati first down so they keep the football again Sam that's 248 yards passing for the Cincinnati Bengals and 114 rushing that's not bad against the defensive very highly touted coming into this football game so the Bengals have played very well in offense but I repeat what I said earlier Bob 82 points the Steeler defense has given up down the last three football games not counting this drive commission push one across and I guess they have to be a little bit concerned heading into the playoffs giving up that many points I would imagine so yes course they do have the number one offensive national football team Alexander breaks tackles to the 25 as we head down to the twominute mark to 37 to 36 to go in regulation time and here's another scored Buffalo has gotten a field goal from Nick Mikkel Meyer to close to Denver lead to three late in the fourth quarter it's 1613 Denver Baku Meyers field goal 32 yards so Buffalo try to cause some consternation for Denver here they're fighting for their very lives to make the playoffs second down three Anderson rolling Ross again at the 15yard line and out of bounds to stop the clock well NBC sports world salutes the champions of 1979 will review the many magic moments with an exciting look at the year's major events from Swan Super Bowl to Stargell series and more don't miss super year 79 the salute to the champions coming your way Saturday December 22nd four o'clock Eastern Time on NBC sports world subtitle sports in Pittsburgh it looks that way doesn't whether there were some on the grand accomplishments in 79 Curtis that he turned the wrong way never looked in time although he was badly under thrown by Anderson so the clock is stopped as we've reached the twominute warning Cincinnati try to make it more respectable they trailed by 20 the Steelers now will go to 11 and three but we'll see what happens with a score in a moment the in Pittsburgh Barney McKinley attempt already our spotters and the statistician George George thank you very much goodness JT Thomas as he comes shy of the fiveyard line it'll be burned down in about one Cincinnati with just one time I don't want to be accused of being a homer but I got to congratulate the Eagles they came into this game three at ten I guess the Pittsburgh Steelers who are obviously going into the playoff played very well I think all things considered with the exception of a couple got beat on they played the pittsburgh steelers pretty much even six away from the touchdown Johnson dives into the pile he may have touched the 5yard line and he had to get there at least they may bring two sticks out for a measurement on third down and one as they unpiloted of his Lauren tapes 51 then Joe green 75 we still playing football like he did when he came here some 10 years ago in his 11th year out of North Texas State at 6 for 260 and the unquestioned inspirational leader of this football team yeah but he makes a lot better commercials now than they used to isn't that a great one for the tough drink company yes absolutely marvelous one of the best I've ever seen does us X jocks or jocks proud he's a marvelous guy Johnson and turned her in the backfield on fourth down Johnson great second effort by Pete as he spun out of the grass for the first tackler and reached the four and a half yard line and that's about all he had to do just to know 3534 the clock continues to run now they stop it with their last timeout that's a close look you see Dwight White 78 you see Jack Lambert 58 Duane Roth wonder of 49 and he still makes enough for the first down so 33 seconds away from the end of this one the only question is will it be 37 17 when we're done or 37:24 will return with the drum gentle giant together I think they had Jill Green in mind do you think so yep 113 left at Cleveland Houston on to Cleveland 38 with one timeout left it could be another old here it's 3717 first down and roll yeardley Anderson intercepted JT Thomas broke up the pass intended for Jim Corbett as Anderson looked right and then came back with a pass right over the middle and it stops the clock with 28 seconds to go it would be nice for Cincinnati to get that one last touchdown you see Kenny this is a screen play to the outside unfortunately they weren't a lot they couldn't screen anybody I think that pass was intended for Charles Alexander I didn't realize Thomas had it in his grasp so easily there Corbett did a good job too you no catch no catch they really trap the ball great pickup nonvash thinks he caught the ball okay we're giving you a report on a Cleveland Cleveland has just recovered a Houston fumble with less than a minute to go so it looks like Leela's going to pull it out and what it does to is move Pittsburgh and undisputed possession of first place and the AFC Central Division will be a game ahead of Houston you will see Don best catches him like a first baseman 22 seconds to play Anderson looks to the end zone 17yard line 78g Burnett 64 was a but white man six a cat a day for the Pittsburgh Steelers reacting to that cleveland houston gave up which they shouldn't react to they want houston they should have Houston win because then both Houston and Pittsburgh are assured of playoff spots here is your final play of the game offside against Pittsburgh four seconds to go in the game the play will come from the 11 yard line Cincinnati obviously will try to put it in the end zone the Steelers lead by 20 they were 14point favorites coming in four seconds to go at the 11yard line as you look at referee Jim Sonny phyto scored leave to Houston seven here in Pittsburgh last Sunday quick pop it completed and that should do it time has expired on the clock and the Pittsburgh Steelers leave the field at Three Rivers Stadium in undisputed possession of first place in the AFC Central Division and as you look at the team leaving the field take a look at Jack Lambert a young man who has played with a shoulder a partial shoulder separation for most of the year it's also interesting that while the football game is on there there's a lot of hatred between the players when a game is over they're friends and that's the way it should be well I think Bob you really hit the nail on the head earlier in this football game when you said the Cincinnati Bengals go at every right to quit at halftime when they were down by 14 points came back made it exciting narrow the Steeler lead to seven and were threatening to do some damage and they hung in there till the end even that final drive was just try to get seven on the board I think since how do you make the tape of this football game of Senet to pop young at st. Louis the guy",

  "transcript": "and Florida feel for this battle between the Seminoles of Florida State is he coming onto the field right there under head coach Bobby Bowden and drying the wrapup and unbeaten regular season as they head on toward the Orange Bowl where they will be facing the big a champion either Nebraska or Oklahoma depending on what happens tomorrow in the Midland and their opponent today wearing orange jersey for the first time ever the University of Florida Gators you see the record on the year an unfortunate one no wins eight losses one time under their new head coach Charlie Bell and again hoping to salvage a measure of satisfaction from what has so far been a very disappointing season relief for these people in the victory over Florida State would be big satisfaction indeed hello I'm Jim Lampley it has been more than a year and Florida State University lost the football game it has been more than a year since the University of Florida won one during that time a lot of things that happened Carly Bell has arrived at Florida to take over and begin rebuilding the Gator football program and Bobby Bowden and the Seminoles have continued what is now one of the most unusual and interesting success stories in all of college football a success story we wanted to show to all of you across the entire nation here with me today to watch the Seminoles in the gator a former quarterback who can still throw it pretty well in our tech football game League Rose Cup and tougher this should be your kind of ball game I think we will definitely see the ball in the air line you know we could see a record number of passes Florida started throwing the ball recently with Larry OSAP today their backup quarterback John Elberon will be playing at the tailback position so we could see him throwing the run fast now you know about Florida State already they have a tandem of quarterbacks who have really become a household word in college football and I'm speaking of course about Wally Woodham and Jimmy Jordan now between those two guys they have combined for over 7,000 yards of career total offense now finishing their third year of sharing the Florida State quarterback job Wally would a man Jimmy Jordan a fascinating story they went to the same high school Leon High School in Tallahassee Florida they are fraternity brothers they have roommates on the road they are like in so many ways and yesterday I talked to them about the unique situation in which they scare the quarterbacking duties of Florida thing while a you and Jimmy has had a fascinating experience these past several years have you ever thought back that perhaps you would have been happier being at another school where you could have had the quarterbacking job all to yourself rather than to have shared it with them well not really it's been a good situation at Florida State over the last three years we've only lost five ball games and I'm I really enjoyed it as far to stay and of course I'm from Tallahassee Florida and I I'm kind of glad to be staying at home is there a positive aspect to the sharing of the quarterback job in the sense that you don't feel the pressure to have to do everything on your own you know that he's there if something isn't going like for you yeah there's that security there for that and also it's just that it's worked out for our team you know when when guys not doing it other guys come in done the job and it's worked out the last three years and we're just glad it has this week you're starting what does that mean to you well it means um you know that we've been starting on and off all along and I I'm just my jobs to go out and get it started and get it going and I'm Kimmy could come on or I don't know I might go all the way it's just what coach Bowden feels Jimmy this weekend you're in the situation in which you've been so frequently while they will start the ball game what are you thinking about you sit on the bench and watch and wait for when your opportunity is going to come yes so you know I'll be you know trying to be ready when if I get called upon well you know I got to start the LSU game goes to televised in touch about tostito be fair while I store distances to be on TV that's good you know we're winning and that's what everybody really wants and you know I said well what as the competition between the two of you affected your friendship at any time in any way we've never had any problems that whatsoever you know we just try to make it a team effort you know if he can do well let him do it if I can let me do it you know it's just like I said the main thing we want to do is win and we've never had any fuss as a fights about about this you know it could be you know when I was were really sorry about the situation we were not a decision typical of the way Bobby Bowden has handled the two quarterbacks all along Wally Woodham will start to because Jimmy Jordan started the LSU game earlier in the season which was telecast to most of the country the two teams that played 21 times Florida has won 16 of them since in the 1950s the Florida State Legislature decreed that they must begin playing each other however Florida State has won the last two and they are the dog which is on top now Florida will try to reverse things when we come back you heard late roast up say that freshman reserve quarterback John Elberon would be playing a tailback today for Florida he has also been selected to return the opening kickoff for the gator and back to kick it for Florida State is number 17 Bills compete a junior from Miami who handles only the kickoff Shores for the Seminoles the field goal kicker is another man so here's the pizzicato all the way to the end zone without the young men will be on the offensive line for the Gators Chris partner a walkon freshman tight end an outstanding athlete bill benefit left tackle and two freshmen will start next to Vinick Van flow from Merritt Island Florida assessment at left guard next to him also for Merritt Island freshman John Redmond at Center who has a bad bump Wally Huff is the right guard an experienced player Joe Wickline perhaps the strongest Locker at the line of scrimmage is at right shackles on first down the Gators are in a bread formation with four wide receivers set back Terry Williams goes in motion and he catches the pass Mario and you can see how quickly the Florida State defense reacts as Williams is up behind the line of scrimmage Larry o Chavez the starting quarterback for Florida he is a walkon junior Janelle brown wrestling from Gainesville starting today at tailback Gary Williams is the fullback a workman like fullback Kirk Garrett a good split end and the best athlete on the offense is this man flanker Cris Collinsworth ISIL allamerica quarterback from Titusville Florida first the Gators try the middle of the line and Seminole Arthur Scott was there to stop Terry Williams after a pickup of two yards now it will be third down finis look at the defensive line for Florida State's Amanda watch their number 50 Ron Simmons the nose guard one of the very best defensive linemen in the United States this is an outstanding secondary for Florida State watch Butler 21 and bonus orc 42 the three safety who has eight interceptions this year on third down three wide receivers Collinsworth somes in motion backboard quarterback coach Jeff near the 40yard line the officials are going to rule completion I think they're going to say that it's a good call I believe that Garrett has possession here is he's running an out pattern double coverage over on the other side on college worth and here is Garrett who we saw two weeks ago catching a lot of passes he does have possession loses possession and then it goes out of bounds and thankful Florida mothering the floor running back all free low before the flakes begins Ron Simmons perhaps the finest nose guard in America right now and he's only a junior he has four or five feet in the 40yard dash awesome upperbody strength he bench presses 535 pounds he probably will be the frontrunner along with Hugh Green next year for the Outland Trophy most important part of the Florida State incomplete was right there with Kirk Garrett and Bobby Butler is a heck of a quarterback number 21 511 154 pounds from Delray Beach we may see him matched a lot manonman today against repellency 21 against 21 he would be giving away five inches in height however they're both about the same speed exceptional speed for four in the 40yard dash Bobby Butler perhaps the best athlete in the secondary and as you pointed out JL a good one you see Bobby Bowden on the sideline falling short at the 30 yeah right there with them Florida State even after getting up the one first down on the completion OSHA a Garrett pull down over back to putt for Florida and need to receive for Florida State Henry will watch the wall and downed at the 48 yard punt and we look at the men who line up along the offensive line for Florida State Grady Kang will help us advance over line of scrimmage good as an outstanding guard they're very strong on the left side John Madden replaced Gill Wesley at center and Wesley was injured the only injury the Seminoles have suffered of any consequence this year sucks it right guard Brandon at right side we repeat the starting quarterback today wall a wood they've been ignored later on mercs down some 420 Knight and Brady can 26 yard line is wooden first pass is complete he ran him out of bounds you look at Woodham and jordan who share the quarterbacking duties were Michaels riding a converted fullback as the starter at tailback mark lot the part of the FSU running game from his fullback position of brethren split em hardest Johnsonville also see Sam flattest acquisition and there's the primary receiver the main receiving French political jacking class poor yard 5710 go incident performance ow near the line of scrimmage and they'll have a third down play coming over here to bend the line for Florida's most consistent player there is Robin Fisher but lucky is the outstanding athlete and Yancy Sutton is a great story of defensive end linebacking situation for Florida has been unsettled for cause of injuries they're missing David little today and Sonny Gilliam is a freshman starting at quarterback number 43 what dah over 70 food defensive tackle from fear the strongest man on the field in yard loss let's take a look at lefty number 72 as Jim Lampley just pointed out the strongest man on the team who was demoted to a second string player because of attitude problems earlier this year has regained the starting role and there you see some of that awesome strength and quickness fourth down as florida state fails to convert on their first turned down opportunity wrong son number three goes back to front number 21 is he proposed in a way I just it takes the Florida State goal inside the 25 to the 23 yard line before Gary punch downs it for the Ximena know early in the first quarter no for the Gators will have the football back hi Ron stark the Florida State his longest 50 year Florida will start the off from the 23 yard line you look at Larry Oh jabs a walkon junior from Orlando and we took over the quarterbacking duty three weeks ago him sober Gator had trouble on offense this year but he has made a difference as you pointed out against Auburn he threw for 269 yards and he has given them something going through the air that is something they did not have prior to that as we look over at Wally Woodham who was sacked and that was always a nice sack of the year Florida State offensive line is generally done a great job if it's all important no sad relation the Collinsworth moves the football only to the 25 pick up the food will be second down 80 they've gotten the football through and low and add subtle doing that two weeks ago in Georgia when we covered their weeks ago he got almost exclusively double coverage sometimes triple coverage today we may see him going man up with Bobby Butler who also wears number 21 there the figures on the year for column four yes is the green number 39 Reggie herring senior linebacker from Titusville Menon let's see if they do go once again to their best athlete on the field with key is Cris Collinsworth SolidWorks we have four four seed in the 40 yard dance and a guy who can really hurt you a lot of different ways guaranted for the bottom of the screen Collinsworth and he comes in most unnatural memory Oh JA he was under pressure and no one was open I work with the man clearing out the protection look there but he's through other way I've read bill hunter with the good coverage on Garrett now Gary Henry is deep to receive for Florida State as again bill Conover gets ready to put it for floor first hunt traveled three secure and Henry by waiting for the ball to bounce the Florida cover his head to get downfield guarantee Midland was signed a block in front of him but they could not open up a hole in Florida safe we'll start on the 38 yard line when we come back Charlotte the lead lineman for Bear Bryant in Alabama and the bulk of that career coaching record some vials at Jacksonville State and then at Clemson he jumps off side for Florida and so the Seminoles of Florida State are the beneficiaries of the first penalty of the ballgame and that will move the football to the 48 not lucky runs another little chunk of the quarterback salivating after that first act right we'll make it first down five now for FSU Sardis Johnson is to the bottom of the dream Jax flowery Janaki Woodham walks microwave indicator territory pass the 40 to the 39 yard line missed the tackle this is what Wally Woodham does so well playaction pass he is better at the short stuff in the intermediate game and throwing to his back here to tailback Michael whiting who Jim Lampley has really made a difference in their running game and he's also effective as a receiver he took over right after a game that I covered earlier this year against Virginia Tech was by that time they had lost two of their tailback you might want to amplify we look at Bobby Bowden along the sidelines they have had trouble at the tailback position losing Greg Ramsay and and the big pullback is inside the 30 to the 25 yard line lucky dragged him down from behind 14yard pickup for life so another first down for FSU this part of their running game has not been week however there's not much of a hole here but he has been known to make his own holes and that of course is big mark Lyles who is second in career rushing now for the Seminoles and has been a consistent ground gainer for them all year long Juan Collin slowed him down before lucky dragged him down is his first down four floors made at the 26 whiting he's just inside the 25 to the 24 number 66 is Robin Fisher the nose guard but it looks like from down in the sand last fun game of the year before they didn't dare hold 64,000 they hope to have 72 thousand feet by September 11 1982 when they will be playing southern town second down seven Florida State Liberty play and a flag is down for a yard look an Steve Sutton made the play with along with 49 Fernando Jackson a freshman linebacker and the penalty is apparently going to be in off there you saw a little bit of the sophistication of their passing attack they have so many different ways that they can hurt you they there is the call right there they do a lot of screens a lot of draws they use the set to a Liberty play they really vary their protection a lot they use play actual classes and of course they have an outstanding drop back series pass depiction has been one of the keys they pointed out only eight sacks coming into the day Walli water and give me George the opportunity artists Duncan to the top of the screen here the freshmen received of the field one weak side the hardest James golden number 57 batted the ball down for four Tim golden is a guy that Charlie tell like the lion he is very high on the potential of this defensive line it was thought that the front seven of Florida would be as good as any front seven in the SEC but they have been decimated this year by injury they lost starting defensive tackle Steve Tanner they lost starting defensive tackle David Galloway a long Yancey Sutton for several games made compelling is on to attempt a 41yard field goal for the Seminole this kick is low the fella was 13 of 18 in the field goal Department before that we make 13 of my team holder Rick stock sales Pelin hit it high capela already the career scoring leader for Florida State before this season even started he added to that but that time you miss connection the blood will have the football what was the line of scrimmage the 25yard line and the Seminoles have wasted the first scoring opportunity at the game three wide receivers 51 is James Gilbert a sophomore defensive tackle from Miami he was the major who's got the football another criminal had deflected it into the air watch very carefully you're going to see the bulb tip before Gilbert comes up with the interception there is the tip right there and here comes the key interception that Jen laughs lead is Foucault's and now excellent field position for the Seminole who got the fifth number 16 got McLean and sophomore defensive end from Clermont Florida was the man who tipped a reserve defensive end is on this hot day Bobby Bowden has already gone to some substitution defense to drag miles down as he gets inside the 15 to the 14 yard line there is named Gilbert one of four defensive tackles whom Bobby Bob uses interchangeably on defense for Florida State and the sophomore from Miami his first major seventh of the that is a rare experience for a defensive tackle and herself the path goes on his face he is the envy of all the other defensive line right now why couldn't it see me second down six yards to go Bill Williams to the bottom of the green fighting it folks we tried to release the ball number Yesi Sutton got this Yesi Sutton who also went to Tallahassee Leon high school same place that Wally would him and Jimmy Jordan went to school an enormous urge to play today and he's coming back off of an injury having missed five games just to play in this one very inspirational story because yes he is deaf our if he lip reads very well in fact last year he's apparently lip read a fake punch in a ball game against Georgia Tech while he would have only two out of five so far on the ball game for 23 yards third down six they must get the ball to the eight yard line for a first down Woodham doesn't like what he sees on the Florida defense and so far the Florida defensive line has been very active much more so than I think the Seminoles had expected them to be possibly because of the reemergence of Doc lucky the man who they felt would be the best man along that front wall certainly he is the physically strongest he has a militant press of over 500 pounds and that does not mean that he bench press is a 500 pounds pin I wanted to clarify that because someone asked me about that reason they're down 11 now but nobody was open downfield Timbaland got there first Robin Fischer followed it well if we were going to do any of the keys today I would have said that the key for florrum that was to establish a past life they would have to do that the propeller is highly sophisticated crashing attack up Florida State so far they have done that and done it very well this is the identical spot from which Davy compelling miss just a minute to half ago only pin back to season two of them so far here in the first court Florida State is now old for for on third down conversions and in preparation for this field goal they have called timeout criminals brought 10,000 fans over from Tallahassee we'll be drying from 41 yards out to give that rescue this one's good six minutes 23 seconds left in the third quarter the defensive tackle James Gilbert Florida State was unable to move the offense but they picked up the field goal by Dave develop and lead it 3 nothing there is a man who is having an incredible year he recently had his 50th birthday 30th wedding anniversary he has a brand new contract you might want to talk more about and just three days ago he received his first franchise and oldest son getting him with a grandson named Bo so found and considered this kind of a turning point year he has turned bid week still young enough the car about another opportunity but reaching the point where he wanted to find a place where he might settle down he has Florida State for security when he was getting offers from other schools he was contacted specifically this year by LMU and they gave it to him in the form of a fiveyear contract total package over six hundred thousand dollars there's Janelle brown he wait stick you call from compete like wind is behind bill capisce and you saw him knock it all the way out of the end zone start with the football trailing three nothing this Monday night on ABC NFL Monday Night Football a empty game between the Seattle Seahawks on the New York Jets but in Thursday night on a special Thursday night edition of ABC's NFL football you will be seeing the New England Patriots and the Miami Dolphins very important game in the AFC East on first down almost intercepted Bobby Butler was the man who had it in his hand Robbi Butler and Keith Jones both had a shot at that ball was made of the fact that John L brown was starting at tailback for Florida today but has not yet touch the ball from that position however he is the leading ball carrier on the team he has been a backup quarterback he wasn't mailed back first and he can run and he can throw Oh 3 of 8 for 19 yo standings after bullhog and he had to wait permit play a Keith Jones is coming into your coverage this ball is well thrown along the sidelines biochem their goal and here is Cris Collinsworth showing some of the form which I think next year is going to make him an allamerican here he is isolated he reminds me a little bit of an old teammate of mine del Cauca in 64 192 pounds and he is fat on first down from the FSU 49 yard line that is Perry Williams with the football do you think I'm sexy I think it's probably about Yulin you think I'm sick well ask Larry in there Marty Cindy or Elaine well apparently they do and thank you don't thank me thank you bet Oh dad that is Salim fourth in defensive end got Warren who went all the way downfield 20 yards past the line of scrimmage to cover that's a tough assignment when a defensive end has to cover Cris Collinsworth all alone because of the nature of the coverage is open but it's a good call by the official that's what Florida was able to affect that time by putting two wide receivers to the top of the screen they got the defensive end covering Collinsville exactly what they want to do today is mix up their formations a little bit more we might even see them using the shotgun which they have not used this year the penalty now being walked off against Florida holding call against the Gators so it all would have gone for not even if Allensworth had stayed inbounds and that moves the football back to the floor 38yard line we're now in a second bound 23 yards to go for a first down John Whitaker number 34 in the game is pull back for Florida Oh Castro almost every day Donnell Brown Jarnell not too happy about that you mentioned him just a moment ago that we hadn't seen him get his hands on the football the first time he does get his hands on the ball tempted past reception he dropped it he frustrated there is number one gone van wie who is the long field goal kicker for Florida and also the kickoff man and he is practicing into the net third down 23 yards to go for Florida first down the FSU like that keep dome knock them out of bounds and that'll make it fourth down presser by Arthur's got defensive in number 54 Ron Simmons number 50 was in there Reggie herring came on the Blitz three guys who have been busy all year when a certain 23 and you know what's coming you have an advantage on over we'll kick Garry Henry is deep the way for FSU very happy chance to run only goddess has the 30 to the 32 yard line Jim calamari reserve nose guard number 71 was downfield to make the tackle for Florida after the 41yard punt by Conover and FSU will start fourth position the 32yard line Henry has been affected this year as a return man in fact we ablated him actually coming into the day however so far he's been shut down light breeze behind walle Woodham artist Johnson to the bottom of the screen flowers almost 4:27 and Phil Carrillo junior quarterback a walkon from Coral Gables who almost had flowers on the sidelines cut and what Pharrell okay what is so close to a touchdown interception here is the sideline cut right now and the ball instead of being prone row and outside is from high and inside and there is a near interception jacqui flowers again to the top of the screen Phil Williams to the bottom Bowden uses wide receivers discipline near the 35 Jim Chris got underneath him pick up a brie and it will be third down seven I think it's the difference between woman and Jordan I think you saw this ramp on that sideline Jordan has a much stronger arm however what I was very effective on playaction passes he's very effective throwing buoys back he's good at picking the defensive the part as a leader when his words ring Jordan is the main that's important he got away from number 47 group Ron Curtis Johnson a freshman who has been very effective filling in for Sam planner as we see what I'm throwing the ball to the sideline and that ball is just well left certainly not an artistic success but a perfect pass as far as a lead and a great catch Phil Williams to the bottom of the screen on first down now from the 37 after that 30 yard completion was down here the 30 I agree with you Michael wedding as we pointed out earlier facility he took over after the Virginia Tech game and he's a good solid runner who also doubles as a receiver there the statistics on wood flour do to the top of the screen Johnson to the bottom all comes loose but Mark Lyle had already gone down since Jones the freshman defensive tackle number 86 was the man who stopped wild after a couple for now it will be third down a yard to go for a first down all is at the 28 they must get just inside the place up not necessarily a running situation for Florida State I think every situation is a possible passing situation and they could go play Austin pass and trying to go for the touchdown right now William to the bottom of the screen the second time today the like getting started when you turn a certain one into an obvious running situation you really have an obvious passing situation here they might fix it up by going to the draw or possibly a sweep because they are a team that like to confuse the defense last year's leading rusher was a tailback named home Johnson he went home before the seafood bacala's happened when they tried Ramsey for Aniyah sort of first down yardage my cricket freshman linebacker number 45 made the play out in the flat to floor there was the screen I just talked about on the platen the liason we talked about home Johnson there is a guy who was number free in career rushing with a year he had last year he has written Bobby Bowden says he will be back on campus for them next week Belem is on the try another field goal this time from the 37 yard line so it's a 47 yard kick within his range especially with a little wind behind him we still have just a minute remaining in the first quarter now Rick Rockville turns to the official insult for timeout and that will be the second one that has been used in the quarter by Florida State leaving them with only one remaining like a Florida player was on the verge of something offside and that befuddled the Florida State offensive line and Stockstill rather than to draw another delay of game call and take them out of field goal range held up the timeout stop if I'm correct does one left that's what I'm going you look at bobby bowden along the sideline aim the florida state from west virginia before he arrives and Seminoles had won four of their previous 33 games yes no good I tried to hook it back in with the wind behind them and it did not grow it's just like hitting the 5iron or watching and stay out there to the right he's going to the trap we hate it don't you coming up next on NCAA college football at 3 o'clock Eastern Time immediately following this game Texas Tech against Houston important Southwest Conference battle as Houston is still in the running for the Cotton Bowl berth 9th ranked Juicin 8 and 1 on the season the only loss to Texas against Texas Tech with a great fullback James had not watch that one on first down OSHA Rose complete to number 88 James Jones a freshman tight end from Pompano Beach Florida and hauled her out with you the linebacker from Sarasota tracked him down James Jones according to Charlie Pell is the finest freshman he has ever seen at this tight end position he has not started because Chris Faulkner being a redshirt freshman has a little more experience but he thinks that James Jones number 88 who we just saw coming underneath on that route has unlimited potential Hollandsworth to the top of the screen air golly once the 42 the 41 and that will be a first down for the Gator I got three yards on the first play they got 81 that one 23 seconds left in the quarter the first out of the 41 Cris Collinsworth taking that quick plant in route there are the sets on Larios if quite a Cinderella story on this young man we'll be talking about interrupts Darrell Jones to the bottom of the screen first Garrett's of the top wagon that was Harry Williams the fullback with a football Martha's got made the tackle and now we'll wait for the penalty cool looks as though it's going to be walked off against the Gators the orange jerseys have already moved the huddle back now they're going to decline illegal motion declined make it second down pin eightynine cents for Jackson comes in a wide receiver with the play and that's the end of the first quarter so in the one quarter playing Florida field it is 3 nothing FFT",

blades every year can help you be your way clean big crowd as usual on hand in Tiger Stadium Baton Rouge Louisiana very significant game between the seventh ranked Seminoles of Florida State University and the Bengal tigers of LSU ranked seventh Heath is this week UPI poll and there are fighting Tigers I'm the season the record for two and oh the two losses to Southern Cal into Georgia the Thomas law a 172 throw heartbreaker here at home about a month ago when Ben topranked Southern Cal came in here and got everything they could handle hello I'm Jim Lampley this is a significant game not only because it matches two of the top 20 teams in the country but because of Florida State in their positions they are ranked stuff but four years ago when Bobby Bowden first came to Tallahassee to take over the Florida State football program they had won four of their preceding 33 games there are some disbelief there are some people who don't believe that they are one of the 10 best football teams the country they have a chance to prove it today by feeding the scene was a great position here in Baton Rouge and LSU make it early take a big step forward and here come the Seminoles of Florida six the record on the season six wins no losses they have had an open week to prepare for this game and to be honest the Seminoles have been pointing towards this game in Baton Rouge ever since preseason practice begins once again I'm Jim Lampley working with them today coach Frank Broyles and coach royal when you talk about this game I think the most interesting element that comes up immediately both teams on offense have an unusual quarterbacking system they both have two quarterbacks who share the duties almost equally very on you that's very unusual and it's really not planned it just happens Bob out and told me yesterday that he hopes this is the last time he's faithful and there's a reason for this when you alternate the quarterback everybody in the stands notice when you also made any other position nobody cares and what could happen in this situation is that the players and fans choose one player as their favorite and they won't him in a ball game and this converts morality to pathology Florida State's two quarterbacks Wally Woodham and Jimmy Jordan both from Tallahassee Leon High School in Tallahassee Florida both excellent Panthers and the Seminoles entered this year as one of the nation's top passing teams the offense really hasn't performed that way and perhaps for that reason Bobby Bowden has made a very significant decision today they've had a ten game win streak over two years Woodham has started all of those ten games today Bowden is going with Jordan for the reason is that he's going to open up in this ballgame and Jimmy John has the strongest arm the quickest relief and Jim he's a impromptu quarterbacking get a hot hand like kid gets laid last year went through four touchdown passes in the second half the to LSU quarterbacks are David Woodley and Steve Ensminger Woodley started the first four games of the year for the Tigers Ensminger will start today as he has started the last two games ends mayor perhaps the better thrower of decision wouldn't it yes he is jim and witless had a little slump and that's why you have two quarterbacks in this situation you bench the one that's having a slump and put the other one in okay we'll be back in a second for the opening kickoff perhaps the key confrontation in the game will be between the Florida State offense and the to defense we'll talk about that as we go along and we'll be back to start this game that's about ready now for the kickoff Florida State will be kicking the football off to start the game and he proceeded for LSU is number 22 chris williams who is one of the nation's leading kickoff returns you see the statistics right there competes number 17 to kick it off for FSU a junior from miami who handles only to kick off duty another man David Kellen picked extra points and field goals for the Seminoles a late arriving crowd most of them probably stayed at home to see the end of the houston arkansas game and with the flight freeze of about 5 to 10 miles per hour behind him poppy sticks the ball out of the end zone they'll start at the 20 yard line here are the facts and receivers we'll be seeing on offense for LSU the quarterback number five seed in swinger need from here in Baton Rouge hokey guys Dan coming back from an injury at tailback Danny swallow is the fullback Robert dilly the tight end they'll use three minutes that position Carlos Carson the key man in the passing game number three the wide receiver and two split back to sometimes lines up in the backfield sometimes wide as jerry mercury first down from the 20 yard line and the give is too hokey guys done and he has about three tackle on the play by Reggie herring one of two outstanding linebackers for Florida State run a defense that ranks among the nation's leaders offensive line for LSU Charles Macduff the left tackle a huge man 268 pounds next to him is guard Tom Kelly number 65 a sophomore center a fouryear player fouryear letterman John Edie brats John Watson from Bossier City Louisiana is the right guard and Ed sentence from friends with Texas attack exactly second down in pair gets it out in the flat you turn and is the fullback break the tackle fumbles the football and it will be Florida State football Oh an immediate turnover at the 32 yard line the man who's gets up with the ball is number 42 monk funnel sort the free safety watch it again we will see that his mega sets up the screen beautifully Hernandez cut inside the kickout block but he doesn't protect the football let's see if we can pick who knocked it loose yes Mona saw it knocked it loose tough break for LSU at this made to the game run assort with the fumble recovery for Florida State it was Arthur Scott the defensive end who made the first contact on the play and the Seminoles now with a golden opportunity at LSU 33yard line Timmy Jordan part in the game at quarterback first time this year he wants to go deep right now that's Jackie flowers when he's overthrown him in the end zone so Jordan tried for the home run right away and didn't get here are the backs and receivers you'll be seeing on offense for Florida State Jimmy Jordan the quarterback you'll also see a lot of number 12 while he would have Michael whiting first start of the year at tailback for him he's a sophomore mark wild is the heart of the running game a big fullback Brady King good pass after that fight in and on second down and 10 yards to go Jordan under a rush it does not have quick feet and he's up for about a threeyard loss George a TN number 60 the big middle guard for LSU one of the better middle guards in the country face Jordan men dropped in for that sack so now it will be third down 13 you look at the offensive line for Florida State there is the best Walker on the front in Lemire Mike good the left guard next to him that's where they'll go on short yardage situation better John Madden replaces Gil Wesley who has been hurt Greg woods is the right guard and the right tackle is fom Brennan as 240 pounds the big offensive line 12 yards to go now for a Florida State first down love the two on the last play in the flats of whiting he beats one man and has a first down inside the 10 yard line Jerry Hill finally made the stop for LSU but a big play on third down for the Seminoles a 26yard gain let's watch it from the end zone you'll notice an image that far se had a man in motion but look at the poise of Jordan if he lays the ball out and of course why he makes a great run after the catch first down just inside the 9 yard line dance for the Seminoles two strikes early step back there whiting in Lyles to give us a lot and the 232 pounds fullback from Buffalo has sex up at about the 60 yard line Emlyn you have a real determine ties the offense like Florida State third ten doesn't need much to just need one down and they execute it perfectly on that third tenth situation they got three on first and goal it's second down from inside the six what's the left side of the FSU offensive line linear and good if they choose to say on the ground wait pull close quickly down to the pool George at me of the middle guard reacted quickly over to his left to help make the tackle by quieting has been the substitute pullback he playin tailback starting his first ball game number 27 likewise turns up field protect that football and picks up George orders that's all you're looking for all the goal line is get what the clock is given is running determined as you can third down goal from the 3 yard line Jacquie flower is split to the right and Jimmy Jordan wants the timeout Florida State receiver was trying to get on the field to bring in a new play you didn't make it Jordan call timeout when we come back FSU will have third and go it's Chevy truck showdown time right as we come back to Tiger Stadium Florida State on their first possession of the football game to the fumble recovery by bonus or third and goal at the 3 yard line quick down let's watch it again it's supposed to defense with LSU Clark they had a man in motion and no one covers Platt who is planning to the inside he's wide open if you look at the far pony see student has two white shirts on the side covering whiting whose own emotions Rick Knoxville will hold and baby cap Ellen will try to add the extra point he done with 11 minutes 49 seconds remaining in the first quarter Florida State capitalizing on a fumble recovery has gone in that make a seven nothing lead we take another look at the touchdown pass Jordan Kazaam flat rocks flat break to the inside your suits to LSU defenders over the left corner of your screen Platt was uncovered a busted assignment in the secondary which is very unfortunate to LSU but excellent execution by Florida State and planky has been playing behind Phil Williams at one wide receiver position back to the starting lineup today in the junior from Jacksonville Florida mix up a Dutch down on the bass from Jimmy Jordan so Bobby Bowden with a calculated gamble came out with Jordan at quarterback after having started Wally with him for ten straight victories over a two season period and Jordan has rewarded him with a touchdown on the first drop Bills defeat will kick it off number 17 deep to receive again Bareilles Kris Williams first kick with Barry this time Williams happy making his pots across the 22 the 23 yard line LSU will start their second possession from their mark muscling number 67 goes downfield to make the tackle he is a starting defensive tackle for Florida State there's the defensive line for the Seminoles Warren motsek Simmons Midland artless got watch number 50 Ron Simmons he is one of the very best defensive linemen in college football linebackers are Harrington jurasky excellent secondary Butler hunter bonus and jump in swingers billet quarterback for LSU okay guys are rock number 39 coming in from his linebacker position is Reggie herring jr. a former fullback from Titusville Florida and he's added about 20 pounds to a physique that used to be 195 now he's up to about 215 or 220 and he is really coming on as a linebacker Jimmy leaf the Seminoles and tackles with 87 means he's around the football Leflore number 89 in the game replacing Robert Dooley at tight in second down 11 yards to go and clean your feet he tackled in the open field by herring but not before he got it out to about the 38 yard line they'll face third and five from there Ensminger was running option play here's anything of stats Russian football remember that how fans should remember that LSU has a running quarterback he will run hops and plays as you did on the last sound on third down and five Carlos Carson has left the football game and the Tigers line up with to fight in they are believed and the cool guys John goes in motion in clinger 1000 now overthrows intended for Jerry Merkel the split back out in the flat and Florida State has forced the punting situation excellent defense by Scott Gorham 80 the defensive end he dropped off to cover the third man out of the backfield he covered in perfectly ends being overthrew it to avoid the interception John Adams number 86 is starting defensive end the punt the ball for LSU he averages 38 and a half yards per kick deep to receive its Gary Henry number 40 a man who is dangerous Henry has twice but the clock returns for touchdowns this year this time he called fair catch and fumbles it out of bounds a mild break for the Seminoles as Henry couldn't control it but lost it out of bounds Florida State leading seven nothing we'll start with the football from their own 34 yard line ten minutes sylweddol in the first quarter when we come back the Florida State Seminoles band has made the trip up here from Tallahassee on the field after a 38yard punt by John Adams the Seminoles start with the football from their 34 yard loss Lag is down as jackie flowers makes the catch across midfield Paul is going to be offensive interference less detect the offensive interference on flowers number 23 well I guess we've got the insulin shot but he pushes Britton um 11 back as he breaks off and comes cleared controls the ball but it's offensive interference with the 15yard penalty best watch isolate what flowers 23 push speed let's watch receiving detect right here his hands what whoo so whether you can play fantasy fit that you can put good pole by the victim obviously he waddles and plow completion but all for North the North Gulf is back to the 19 yard line 15 yards losses down it will be second down 25 for the Seminoles from there officials James Harper Dennis rigs Robert Towne Joe Pitt canal granting Jim Campbell Ronnie Baines Southeastern Conference first this is one and he has only a few back to the 23yard line once again George attea the middle guard number 60 a junior from Allentown Pennsylvania came over to make the play for LSU third down 22 yards to go as you look at the starters along the defensive line for LSU the man who lost their 94 Graham on white makes a lot of big plays for the fighting back Jordan wants his night in Brady can i knee over frozen so the Seminoles now will punt from deep in their territory coming on to putt the ball will be number three Ron starts a sophomore from 50 Lake Minnesota averaging over 40 yards per kick he's an interesting story a decathlete in fact the metro seven conference individual decathlon champion hole deep to receive the punt for LSU is Chris Williams is a tough punt returner LSU under Charlie McClendon known for years for the kick returning they have a different kick return and maybe we can see it if it the kick is that's adequate firstly let's see if they can set it up on the Puntland short and rolls dead at the 44yard line so we didn't get a chance to see the return but we will see the bingo Tigers of LSU starting with the football and excellent field position at their own 45 yard line 34 yard kick by start it is homecoming day here coach yes they're the Holcomb Queen LSU is old so they're pretty girls and they're fine football team they are pretty earthbound been from the 45yard line be wide receiver three wide receivers before the Tigers in Brazil the quarterback clothes over the middle intended receiver was Orlando McDaniel and the man who came over McDaniels back the bathtub all down was Pete Jones the crowd thought it was interference but the ball had been touched before it was a free ball you're exactly right Jim when the ball is touched defended by deflected by a defensive man harm off into man it's a free ball there's no more such thing fast interference you can push job do anything you want to get to the football there's Jones number 28 did good place you saw herring get his hands on it person in Jones batteries down second down 10 from the 45 yard line immersion is McDaniel LSU has come out in mr. Carlos Carson first down for the Florida State 35 yard line number 21 Bobby Butler made the stop there Carlos Carson from West Palm Beach Florida a tough man to handle let's walk Ensminger watch the poi he's looking cool throw between the linebackers where he can rifle the ball in get Carson vital the numbers big play now LSU is threatened there's one that got away from the Seminoles and the Gators and all those other instate Florida schools he was not a heavily recruited player first down it's a geyser rifle down to the 30yard line Walter Carter senior defensive tackle number 76 from Richmond Virginia made this up to the Seminole Jimmy always talked about momentum when you get the momentum you see the team run out at home a little bit quicker a little bit faster to get up the last Remy's and they come off with a good takeoff the fella issues Emma sighs the momentum there's a remarkable coach in that dark red sweater bobby bowden record at Florida State 29 wins 11 losses where they came from guys up one man to beat he stays inbounds you bet he did not he stepped out of bounds at the 8 yard line 23 yard run four guys on another first down for LSU a mere myth let's look again at the quick sweep quick pick guy John has the ball he forced to turn up whenever he sees daylight it was just a small crack but he knows where the phone line is watching number 47 outrun the Jones number 28 to the boundary but good faith back right there on 8 yard line first and goal now for the Tigers trailing 7 nothing to the football game but moving now in fingers wrapped up and there you see number 50 Ron Simmons deep off middle guard at the Seminole 6 1 234 pounds the junior from Warner Robins Georgia and he is a remarkable play watch number 50 Simmons he's a outstanding football player he controls the block of the board in this he penetrates in the backfield and catches the quarterback is me from behind you need a play like this to turn that momentum around and give you teams can hit second down goal now from the 13 yard line Carlos Carson going into the end zone marking the intended receiver he makes the catch the flag is down if the call is against our toothpaste this is a touchdown that the in Florida State the up step is stable post of the receivers that the man on the right going across to the left evidently push the linebacker out of the wood not against Florida State protocol I'm sorry lfyou offensive interference I'm in against LSU I'm sore out there I just had to all team do op it to the end crossing from the right to the left hook into the linebacker and kept him from covering park cost good call by the fish just as you called it offensive interference football moves back now to the 28 yard line white tiger players have gone into the end zone with the football neither one was a touchdown guys on stepped out of bounds Carson touchdown catch nullified by offensive interference third down goal now from the 28 zone separate them from the football each zone number 28 of junior song safety from Wildwood floor well he got a good break on Monday when the coach's grade the film because he collisions receiver let's watch 28 tilt as Carson is breaking across the middle ends minutes waiting that he gets open playing rifle the ball between the linebacker so let's watch the collision right there and charge the ball loose number 28 Keith Jones on to try a 45yard field goal now is the LSU place kicker John Bartell number 8 David Quigley other quarterback hold for Bartel kicking into a very mild breeze with his hip is going to be still so the tiger wait a soaring opportunity the big mistake the offensive interference called and nullified a touchdown pass and with 7 minutes 12 seconds remaining in the first quarter Florida State still leads at 7 nothing will be back we're back at Tiger Stadium on the campus of LSU in Baton Rouge Florida State now with the football out at the 28 yard line at the bartels midfielder 445 yards first down Jordan throws the flowers complete at the 35 yard line number 40 over there is Marcus Quinn withdraw basically from the flowers picks up seven it will be a second down three one of the base passes in football wide receiver single coverage go down by step break for the boundary the ball is their completion 7 yard game time flowers to the bottom of your screen and Bill Williams to the top that is white sophomore tailback from Largo Florida who had carried the ball only 29 times coming into this game as a couple my quarter state gym is the minutes at offense they fought back stays over on the practice field and virtually work so nothing but the package game a substitute quarterback works on the running game so that he can't have perfection in a game such as this third down two and a half yards to go flowers to the top of his green hardest Johnson number 22 a freshman to the bottom of the tree whiting in motion and Lyles has the football and the first down across the 39 yard line so FSU will have the first down day now let's look back at the offensive interference call which wiped out the touchdown pass to Carlos stark Carson is breaking across defense Enzo and someone right in the middle had had run across the edge of the line back Jinxy it it was a touchdown for LSU except for the penalty call back Williams for the bottom of his green jacket flowers to the top on first down whiting again in motion Florida State has come out dripping as Bobby Bowden said they want business white by Chris William the junior quarterback from Tioga and an incomplete or Jimmy Jordan Jim Chris Williams number 22 sack of the nation in taxes last year with 850 already has three this year he is one of the premier defensive backs in the southeast in competition Bobby Bowden strolls the sidelines Jimmy Jordan on the game three of six now for 36 yards the first time this season that the Seminoles have played this wide open on often flowers and hardest Johnson are the receiver Gordon wants flowers deep he's got 16 yard line it wasn't push down if you could have 50 feet heat really feel in Chris Williams down the miss 44 yard completion Jordans up louder let's watch it again he dropped the ball right in the arms of flowers number 23 but let's watch the concentration right perfect concentration he can pull the ball for the big completion let's watch it again one thing to Bobby Bowden told me he said Jim John has a ball that you take out run and here's a perfect example of it on first down gets it inside the 15 down to the 12 yard line Willie peel made the pickup from a free safety position it will be second down four yards to go I'll make it five yards to go they must get to the seventh for a first down if you look at Tully Mac Charlie McClendon in his 18th year as a head coach here at LSU no business the swansong and then last year on the job present her Football Focus pulsations this year thousand down the football game at middle guard for ls3 he's number 58 white gets to the 10 it will be third down there from Florida State you've seen 77 Benjy pivot oh is there 58 Bowser then we've seen our state go deep a couple times in this first qualify without filming so if you get behind the LSU second there is they have a Tennessee to lay up on the intermediate passes about 15 yards and try to get involved when you do is you got a great receiver you're on WiFi and that's what happens just third down three yards to go at the 10th the Seminoles are two for three on third down today growing in the Blackwell Isles and he just overthrew he had flour for a moment in the end zone but that was not where he was looking we have to realize that Florida state of a passing team at third and three is a basket down so wonderful for people like LSU by crunch wise from our school broader state doesn't expect them they're coming out for anywhere on the feet Jamie Jordan now four of eight for 80 yards this will be a 27yard field goal attempt the baby coming on the year he is seven of ten Rick stocks being the third team quarterback hole kick is up and he missed it wide to the right so LSU dodges a bullet there three minutes and 57 seconds still left in the first quarter as you look at scores from games involving the top 10 teams today alabama leading virginia tech 21 7 in the third quarter nebraska pounding colorado Cornhuskers can really roll it up later on today southern cow axis California and there's the heartbreaker for Frank Broyles and all Arkansas bands a 13 to 10 loss to Houston Ohio State still playing well their quarterback arch leaks are having a great year in Oklahoma now beating Iowa State 14 nothing in the third on first down David Woodley now in the football game at quarterback for LSU loses the football and LSU recovered to Florida State players at excellent chances at the ball 42 bonus or and 28 Jones that they could not get through it wooden is in the ball game is a little bit better runner than his mayor watching turned off the field but it doesn't protect the football this detects right here was knocked out watch the great effort I guess by Wallace number eight remember said bollocks recovers the ball sweet thirteen receiver Lionel Wallace a junior backed up the garlic barking from Houma Louisiana made the thick flavor LS he was the first down for the Tigers annika 42 and this is Leroy jump nursing a sore knee he did not play last week but Leroy Jones picks up six yards before heading for Richardson makes the stop for Florida State both teams starting to use some substitutes it is 83 degrees here today in Tiger Stadium so depth could be a factor as the game goes on after the fiveyard picked up by Jones it is now second down five for LSU Wallace to the top of your screen look forward to the bottom David Woodley now the quarterback to get was the Jude Hernandez and the sophomore fullback from Baton Rouge was rather right at the line of scrimmage falter up here linebacker from Sarasota made the stop for FSU is not a high percentage play it makes big yards occasionally but it has a zero like it did on that particular occasion Borowski diagnosed it made an excellent play third down five LSU is Oh for two on third down conversions so far in the ballgame three wide receivers and the man in motion a lot of activity deep in woodenly gets away from herring and gets the first down Karofsky brings him down as it gets down to the 44 Reggie herring had a shot at Woodley in the backfield but could not bring him down 80 all right ringing up in the first down how many times have you seen a quarterback make that move Jim he herring has a shot only he should have made the play wouldn't they stop divot inside has made the first down this is the time remaining in the first quarter and Hernandez Leroy excellent play by the quarterback coming hard that was Bobby Butler 7th ranked Florida State unbeaten on the season six wins and no losses coming in here to face the same challenge that earlier this season States in repop ranked LSU excuse me Southern Cal the Trojans came here on a Saturday night the Baton Rouge and had all they could handle before escaping with a 17 to 12 win and Florida State can win here it will lend a lot of legitimacy to their top 10 rankings whittling down the middle and the ball is knocked away 89 is regular Florida tight in under 48 who once again made solid contact with eat jump even hard hitting throwing centered he will get a bonus plus with that play because the fall was open in the middle the fall I think Willie hung them all up just a little bit and said a ride for them then June 14 as we say it knocked in Luke look at these scores Boston College is eating army started to a Pittsburgh first Navy bubble meeting the Midshipmen 24/7 first loss of the season for me where it's down now the flip pays off Gary Henry the nickel back in the five defensive backs defense ain't lifting from the left side and dumps Woodley before he could look down to watch number 40 coming from the left blitzing Henry we lifted into the Secretariat on the quarterback Edinburg Richardson was also there now John Adams second front of the ball game for LSU deep to receive it is Henry he is going to watch it roll and it takes a tiger roll inside the 10 so the Seminole 4pin back deep in their territory 48yard month for Adam they'll have a leak or dare remains undefeated leading Pennsylvania or Nellie and Yale will be playing next week and affirming the Ivy League championship pencil in Harvard cold in Columbia I'll tell you the Yale coats farm codes to me one of the most impressive men in college athletic he certainly is he last year president American Football Association has done a great job this year with an experienced team runneth even leave my heartily Jimmy Jordan still at quarterback for Florida State he has played the entire first quarter getting his first start of the year good faith wants to go deep he's got a man there it's loud it was not flowers it was hard as Johnson the freshman from Tampa and Jimmy almost hat he put a great move on Brit who's an outstanding secondary man but wit did what once again what bowed and said LSU by hesitated momentarily and you see Johnson in behind the ball broke just outside the boundary let's watch it again what's the move right here he hesitate goes outside and Britain I'm 11 it seated on the play but the ball is overthrown Johnson has speed they expect him to be an outstanding receiver in the future and Bobby Bowden's pants oriented office a give on second down is the mark Lyle and Lyles get across the 10 to about the 13 yard line a little breathing room for the Seminoles Albert Richardson freshman linebacker for LSU made the stuff and this will bring up third down you see the time ticking away in the first quarter another passing down situation part of safe the one man cheering section for the top of the screen artist Johnson to the bus very well covered in the middle the Ron Sark we did not get his first pump very well is sent onto the field by that man Bobby Bowden and Chris Williams an excellent Confraternity to wait for it for LSU and LSU should have good field position after the punt dark first kick went for only 34 yards Quinn and Williams are waiting at me William 50y from the go beeping as before the touchdown LSU will have first and goal after the 43 yard return by Chris weak what's the effort by Williams number 22 as he catches a puck he's hit momentarily and that sometimes is the best thing that happened to poverty calls the other covers over ran the ball and force Williams makes a great effort right here Michael whiting was the man who caught Williams from behind the first quarter ended on that play LSU will be in great position when we come back Mike Williams here's the latest in a long line of great defensive backs to play at LSU he just pissed off a 43yard punt return to give the Tigers first and goal inside the six yard line David Woodley is the quarterback full house backfield and two tight ends this is guys are falling forward to about the three fiftyone James Gilda reserved defensive tackle was there along with Paul kurowsky and you look at first quarter fitness if we look at Florida State they a heavy old path and 82 21 and just we expected LSU have you old running 21 to 61 to 29 even game LSU won the big place that was it the fumble was gave Florida State the opportunity to go ahead 7 nothing here second and goal crawling toward the goal line is Danny swallow while of a junior fullback from Elton is down to the 1/3 down goal from there the season section rises up let's watch swallowing on the pointed 7 run lot of midlife determine effort he makes he's not going to give up he still kicking Lycia feet daddy but official has stopped the ball thrown the whistle third one third down and goal at the one that's what God watch the determined effort that he makes right here dime aborted seven if he goes into the endzone given that last surge of leg power to put it across the goal line now Woodley holds for barbell and barbells kick it through so 13 minutes 55 seconds still to go before halftime and and what is so far been a wild game LSU has tied it up most I don't know if this is the lookout things to calm urgent some strange disease usual place for a college football game Michael whitey artists Duncan steps in front of him to take the kickoff and Duncan it's back to the 23 yard line Seminoles will start the offense from there we look to see who comes on a quarterback it will be Jordan Jordan look very precious to me he's been owned target on the Bob one time he was low bit wide out of Bounce which could have resulted in to a touchdown though neck he's looked sharp to me wind is only about 5 to 10 miles per hour just a little breeze but now Jimmy Gordon may be operating against me they had it with them in the first quarter when they went to the bomb we'll see if they stay up top mark Lyle and Michael whiting are the set back behind door and once hardest Johnson through it through the hands of James Creek now Bret number 11 is coming back from a broken hand this is his first return to the lineup since breaking the hand four weeks ago and it's conceivable that he might have held on to the football where he helped it well said Jim and of course the broader state had planned to pick only freshman Thomas number 33 who has a played football they've been playing in place off Jim from the folks on the level wide receivers now our Phil Williams 87 and Jackie flowers 23 powers to the top of the screen the pitches for white second down he breaks the tackle and has good yardage seven yards out to the 30 but the problem with staying with the passing game is when you get the incompletion on first down you can get good yardage with the running play on second down and you still have a tough third down pull third and 3 normally a passing call for the Seminoles they have to throw the ball the less they dwell it's all play occasionally they might want to call play with going they like to throw some types of short time to get the first day the top of the stream flowers to the box first man was open was the first one to get to Jordan George attea got there and so did John Atta the reason that God had no one to throw through they had double covered the wide receiver and was a quick pass with very little protection and it broke down and Gordon was taco polo though an effective team in the past events on that play by Charlie McClendon gsella thief that and Sark who had difficulty on the lam punt partially the pose of a bad snap goes back to kiss on the steps a little high but plenty of time to get it away kicked it in front of Marcus Quinn and it's going to roll out of bounds at the 45 yard line LSU continues to operate without standing field position after the 35yard punt by dark this week on ABC's NFL Monday Night Football live at 9 o'clock Eastern Time the Seattle Seahawks versus the Atlanta Falcons two of the very interesting rising teams in the National Football League beyond quarterback Jim Zorn threw four touchdown passes last week against Houston wide receiver Steve large in the Pro Bowl across two of them and Steve Bartkowski led his team to the playoffs in Atlanta last year Fran Tarkenton is currently boosting Bartkowski for possible all four guys on first down it's outside and is dumped at mid speed number 21 bobby buckle is an outstanding faculty on the quarterback position also has five interceptions as a word to say two guys on their guys John goes back to the hug guys John now seven buried forty yards in the ball game it's second and five for the Tigers hi John it looks pretty good running that football outside I didn't know that he'd had that kind of speed Jim but he's gotten outside three times so far Carlos Carson to the bottom of your screen sent back for swallowing guys in Derry Murphy to slip back to the south the guys on let's get to the ground and try to grind it out a little bit Reggie herring was there along with Scott Warren there's a pickup before it will be third down one let's watch God y'all turn up to the short yardage good pursuit out the line of scrimmage by 80 Warren Scott Warren out 10 football player he turned it back inside and then moves back to the inside and helps on the Cochran number 80 Scott Warren a premed student third down and one now let's park into the top of the screen read that back behind with them and what they want to throw up as Corp first down at the 37 yard line Butler gave him the cushion and Carson simply flipped the ball into his arms and set that about on short yardage you single up you go into a lip Seabiscuit Connor stop the run it forces you 101 and very wise they put them was given a good cushion to Carson give them a first down but not the touch net Boston African completes do fact two receptions for $28 Carson this time to the bottom of the screen on first down swallowing guys on behind with the guys and the LSU Tigers are starting the block support ready Marian came out from his linebacker position to make the stop but the lead back in this case is Danny swallow is starting to block the corner effectively and this is the LSU ground attack let's watch the blocking right here by Murphy number 29 blocked me on the cornerback the left of your screen right there makes excellent play and keeping hunter out of it for a big gain dajung second down two yards to go after the gain of eight Murphy is the DiNapoli's breeze Carson with a buck Karofsky got there first and may have wrapped him up short of the first down it will depend on where they mark the ball walter Carter senior defensive tackle is also there you look at Bobby Bowden many have written in the newspapers and have rumored the idea that Bobby Foust may come here to LSU the end of this year to replace Charlie McClendon this man as the head coach as we mentioned before McClendon is on his way out it would be a tough decision for Bowden to leave the program that he has built to such Heights now at Florida State he's 24 and 5 for the last two and a half years that Blanche were the best record of any team in the country he's a great young man that has built the record for himself with a passing game which is exciting or attractive to the Baton Rouge fan Florida State people are well aware of the need to keep out and happy it is reported that he has been offered a new fiveyear contract giorgia stays unbeaten in the Southeastern Conference now third down left the New York goes over the top to pick up the first down so the LSU Drive stays alive as they move the football inside the 26 yard line Mississippi leading Vanderbilt bordick to the 28 against Ole Miss Sloan's only won one game it's 50 souther was body college done a great job leading memory bal\u00e1zs district to safety look at all lake laura came back to the Demon Deacons the nation's Cinderella team were down 38:28 going into the fourth quarter and they came back to win it at winstonsalem so for the first time in 30 years Wake Forest is won seven games I call against enemy flag is down that zone gets around the right side for about for the pike that would look his napkin and I believe his napkin and I believe that stuff 50 Simmons Junko five momentarily fiveyard penalty tough break Florida State you know overhead as penalties on this movie just like blue face is the more popular than greatness exactly I guess they're meant to be personal probably just turned blue as the day goes Jade I guess big dance tonight I kind of like it college football the color on the pageant winner surrounded excited there you heard it from coach Frank Doyle go out next week climb the college football game and paint your face Tracy Porter in the game is split back now he's to the top of the screen Carlos Carson to the bottom first down five at the 21 this is junk the knee is not bothering the Roy Jones you saw the quick cut to the outside he's down to the 16 yard line before bulla Forte with help from Carter was able to stomp him I said bonus or say I shouldn't they bought of course the e is silent but there's Leroy Jones number 9 a senior from Baker Louisiana who missed last week's game against Kentucky but is coming back strong he's a strong rudder at course you need to tailback says he's going to rot him most of the time all fake keeps me fresh gives me better chance to make yardage Tracy boarded to the top of the screen Lionel Wallace down the game and he is to the bottom first down at the 11 yard line and Woodley is jumped by porosity as he gets it down to about the seventh let's watch woodenly turn up the field a quarterback is told on the goal line is when you see a fractal when this close turn it up don't worry about the pitch take a chance on getting the lowest yet for your head lower your hands make what you can we had George is Donovan good old first down this close to the goal Westman tackle now in the ballgame an offensive tackle on the left side for LSU is matching up against well for Carter 76 he's been playing very well for Florida State this is generous as they go the other way to the right side they can make a first down without getting the touchdown but they must get the ball inside the one to do so the thing the Florida State is missing on defense there's a hard corner all these rods has been breaking outside the defensive ends and the cornerback is did help at not being able to come up and support the run at the line of scrimmage and LSU is taking advantage on Jones now five carries for 19 yards and he has come in to relieve guidance step back to our Joan and her man on third down and two yards to go would it be let's watch the touchdown again you'll see the fake to the fullback and when they just fall off the floor back that's obviously Mizuki 2 yard line there's a little hole he dives over for the goahead touchdown Blaz 55 yards they ate up five minutes in doing so and LSU has gone on top Bartel skin is wide to the right so the bengal tigers lead 13 to 7 7 minutes 22 seconds still to go before halftime and Florida State's behind for one of the first times hardest Johnson has replaced Michael whiting as the man in the middle of the kickoff formation he is back there deep as Bartel gets ready to kick it off they move waiting to the right side perhaps because Bartel has been hooking his kick off this one he booms right down the middle he was being told to do by Keith Kennedy and so Florida State will start from the 40yard line third quarter North Carolina State and Clemson in a bap Clemson has a very tough defense whole days trying to come back from the tough loss last week final score and a big day for Pat dye and East Carolina as they tied North Carolina look at that one coach Jim Carlin is the homegoing Lyle's and ricky williams the step back behind Guinea Jordan and this is Ricky Williams the freshman from Griffin Georgia considered by some the outstanding player in Georgia last year and he dropped for a twoyard law what the fans can do to help your football team with momentum mls years now hit the fan so cheering and yelling you players respond and it's time to other team as you look at the chalk talk for the LSU offense on the sidelines 15 LSU players shaved their heads infinitely before the Kentucky game last week so Charles mixup is not out of order there second down 11 Jimmy Jordan trying to get it going for Florida State LSU has assumed command of this game Jordan is not that and he finally dumped by John Adam he was taking him from behind number 94 Lymon white was the first man to get in there and put the pressure on Jordan to force an out of the pocket Lymon white on white number 94 Johnny Mack says just a great football player watch his epic to go around the offensive blocker and chase the quarterback out of the pocket found out on some 86 with a little more speed his wife is going to make the play that was Kim Lanier the outstanding blocker on the Florida State offensive line whose white feet so now a third down and 11 Jackie flowers to the bottom of the screen and the pass is complete in the flat to Ricky Williams but short of first down yardage this program is being brought to you as an exclusive presentation of ABC for now let's pause five seconds to allow our local stations to identify themselves this recover GUI CATV we are in pirate city on the campus of LSU in Baton Rouge Louisiana where LSU leads 7th ranked and unbeaten Florida State 13 to sexy bronze arches keep the pot for the Seminoles the offense has called for them since midway through the first quarter and Stark's best punt of the day sailing deep where Marcus Quinn takes it inside the 30 they faked the reverse but the Florida State Seminoles covered it excellently down to you LSU is known for that reverse country turn and the FSU defenders were ready for it so with five minutes 17 seconds to go before halftime for LSU still leads Florida State will be back coming into this football game the Florida State defense ranked among the nation's leaders against the rush giving up only a few yards per game LSU already with 105 yards on even Woodley from the flip back position trying to hit creepy Porter downfield and that is a little wrinkle that Charlie McClendon throws been every once in a while last time was able to kiss it out to Woodley but FSU was ready for that one too but will this phase in a bowl game win back the defense automatically looks for something tricky arrow path and Horace think was ready for now Woodley comes out and in summer remains in the game the quarterback it was Woodley who moves LSU during both of the tiger touchdown drive Carson in motion John going ended for the 21 Tracy Porter and Bobby Butler 21 for Florida State was back to the same place let's watch the replay all Porter Porter head 21 receptors last year Jim and 7 optimal for touchdown he's already had one touchdown he's trying to outrun Butlins number 21 this'll happens it but was outstanding defensive back for Florida State good play on his part incomplete pass that back now Hernandez 13 and guys on 47th Karla's Carson is to the bottom of your screen makes the tackle picked up the seven if you're happy third down from just outside or 35 yard line I'll repeat the point coming into this game Bobby Bowden Seminoles are among the nation's leaders against the rush LSU already with 110 yards on the ground at more than the Seminoles average yield of 103 Don Adams will now punt it for LSU excuse me coach all right that was a surprise I'm sure because they felt the defenseman population Gary Henry will take this one at his 15 is dangerous if he gets outside but he does good coverage downfield by Kris Williams number 22 and the rest of the single Tigers who are down there and Florida State will start at the 20 yard girl this is the tiger den where the fans are participant they're not just spectators they actually follow the team up help them get the momentum and the fortunes go run along with momentum looking penalty against Florida State and this will put the Seminoles even deeper in the hole as it will move it back to the 10 yard line so after the 49yard punt by adam and the penalty against Florida State the Seminole starts deep in their own territory when we come back Florida State scored on their first possession of the football game and since then LSU has controlled this game on the ground Seminole now starting from their 10 yard line for 24 left Sephora nest as Michael wedding and the Seminoles have not been able to get a ground attack going against LSU to balance the Panthers very interesting statistic Florida State is average one guard on first down LSU 4.6 on third down two out of seven conversions for Florida State three out of six LSU in this kind of football game a tough game when you lose one phase of your offense one impressive you're likely to use lose your pass and also some field position all day also for Florida State second down eight now Gordon wants to throw in Pacifico mrs. Jordan under throws and it goes out of bounds the intended receiver was the tight end number 85 Grady King and James crit was back with cover changes strategy for LSU Jim very interesting in that shot and I thought he had to rush and played man for man in the secondary and when he did Florida State hurt him there's a penalty against LSU labeled use of the hands to the first down that could be a big break for Florida State well they can usually yes they need to get something to give them a little momentum illegal use of the hands personal foul mentioned field position before the referee rolling that penalty that's James Harper jr. the referee from Atlanta Georgia one reason for the difficulty in field position John Adams of LSU have hunted three times before yard average run start the Florida State is averaging 238 two or six but that's a little misleading the first two weren't all that good Wow a second Williams with the football on first down and Ricky Williams is that a bit of a rocky start in freshman year Florida date gets three out to the I'll call it the 30yard line it'll be second down something unless you will likely double covering force phosphate go to their titanium or one of the box flowers out of the ballgame the wide receivers are Johnson to the top and Williams to the bottom that John third down now Jimmy Jordan who was sharp earlier regarding to had a little trouble with his climate that's what you try to do on defense damn you disrupt the pounding over with legal put a little rush on with water back I'm not the brains unsure of how long he'll have pick out his receiver Jordan had 80 yards on the first few Drive in only 85 yards again big third down receiver Grady came to fight in covered from his own safety commission though another punting situation from Florida State and this crowd is getting more and more fired let's watch win number 40 plate expertly old pasty pinched coming over the shoulder of King watch him right here and knocks the ball loose excellent play on his board within the first act there's Ron stuck workin for a thirty eight point nine yard average in the game he had several earth and Marcus Quinn calls for the fair catch as he falls forward at the LSU 40yard line so not a particularly deep kick in a grant again great field position for the Bengal tiger coming up at halftime the fireman's fund flashback highlights of today's Houston Arkansas game a great game you missed it be sure to stay tuned at halftime to see those highlights also the ABC News halftime report and both things here in colorful Tigers City just outside the 39 in swinger is now the quarterback because guys John who's off to a great start in this dance eight yards across the 45 and 47 there's a flag down the line of scrimmage once again broader state had no forceful Nakano the robber Stephen Gorda had blocked the cornerback Connor no support good running room but a penalty against LSU another breaker Florida's danger and as we said before they can use them at this point LSU is controlling the football game this year is the first year that the clocks are total penalty went through declares ready up though so this year the clock started on the snap and that's a big factor working against Florida State right now now it will be first down and 23 yards to go for the first down on the line here today ehhem game Florida State winning streak over pcs in period one of the longest in college football instincts short difference don't need some saving tackle 28yard pick up four guys on descoth outstanding rug very simple plate turn and pick the ball student potted to the light but watch what Gaga under he cuts back inside a pursuit Duras key misses the tackle at the line of scrimmage golly he knocked down by pub he the statistics on the day for hooky guys on 12 carries 88 yards Laroy jump on first down and this is a big play from the Walker flame sophomore defensive end number 50 from Clermont Florida before the game Charlie McClendon's big objective and setting up the LSU offense was to try to influence the great Florida State nose guard number 50 Ron Simmons they've done an effective job there have been quite low caliber motion which has kept Simmons at home and took him taken him right out of pursuit second down pin and it is been an old football number 14 was Defty mile the freshman tailback in the ballgame for his first carry he could not get the handle on in fingers handoff and with a minute and a half left and a half Florida State finally has the ball in decent fields of this let's see if we can detect what happens oh well we had just dropped it I believe that miles had his hand up and incident could not put the ball in the pocket you have to get to elbow left elbow up high where the quarterback has a pocket that can turnover of the game for LSU we were unable on that replay to to see who it was who made the recovery for Florida State but it was number 67 mark motsek who got there first Neffe flower garden junk freshman wide receiver hardest done flag is down could be all set about that for example Dell su is definitely all Kyle it is a touchdown 53yard touchdown pass Jimmy Gordon the hardest Johnson and just like that Florida State is back in it let's watch number 22 Doc's go right down the boundary twinkled the middle and his father God said he felt like he could get behind LSU the Fiddler's because they don't dig deep they are thinking to stop the short fastest one concentrate many the shows of his heels and in front of go ahead far west to time substance 172 pounds freshman from Tampa and that touchdown ties it at 13 now baby capela can untie and he does go with one minute 22 seconds remaining before the half Florida State goes back on top 14 to 13 you look at Charlie McClendon you know Jim that this clan can realize is when he if you don't back up will omit the defensive back if you just kind of level all think'll run right banya they've got blazing speed and against times what we have already hope you and I know what Charlie McClendon is over there thinking you're thinking how mistakes will kill you in a football twice in half LSU has fumbled both time Florida State recovered both times the Seminoles capitalized for such that you can just watch the tremendous release and power in the arm of Jordan the concentration of Johnson he's behind the secondary something with a minute to go you wouldn't think would happen I guess that experience secondary as LSU has called the soul Patrol the 53yard touchdown pass now stretches Jimmy Jordans of the day to sit out of 15 for 138 yards if people kick it off as you look at Chris Williams eat at the goal line for LSU the man who called for a fair catch was Lionel wallow junior reserve split in from Houma Louisiana common so it will be LSU football at the 32 yard line and we can expect I think the see Ensminger yes it is in slinger at quarterback minute 21 to go as you see in the first half and Florida State outplayed and pushed all over the field by LSU throughout most of this first half has gone back on top that was Ron Simmons who got through there to stop him before he ever got started similar shots yet invited offensive set up as Jonathan the freshman receiver he had well before the season the Seminoles long hurt unglue considered perhaps their outstanding receiver not before the season they lost him in the first game you'll get another year of eligibility so Johnson has gotten to come on in flood and down breaking attack that is swallow football is loose and again FF you Heath Jones is there and so is ivory Joe hunter and in his ivory Joe hunter then your cornerback from Tallahassee who made the recovery Lola course he makes a good run but you have to protect the football in an open field both hands excellent that's a good effort on his part and when he cuts back let's seewe has the ball one hand going into crowds you covered up the one thing you don't want to do the part of state has given them them all again with the momentum I would guess unless you were line up about 25 yards deep hold any of the pass is right there and talk about effort the man who missed the tackle in the flat was Keith Jones and he was also there to help honey with your cover if again team to fight in and this time amid three defenders king is unable to hold on to robert Cerruti sophomore free safety man a 39 from Port Neches Texas was found there defending here's the end of the play you can see that the LSU fax you ruddy had the advantage of the receiver and could have possibly made them ascension was good play on his phone faith in their buried deep right now time for perhaps two or three more plays in the first half second down 10 flowers to the top of the screen and he wants flowers Jane look at the difference internal 3pls use zero for Florida State if that has been the difference so far the reason that the Seminoles are on top of the ballgame in a way it's the reason they're even in the ballgame correct third down pin now Jimmy Jordan trying to capitalize on the latest of the three fumble recovers Jackie flowers with 23 to the top of the screen hardest Johnson to the bottom this time it's done first down and he inside the 35 to the 33 yard line before Britt and Chris Williams finally bring him down let's watch Johnson go across the middle and see the concentration the young freshman has sidestep defensive back all right old target good concentration Texas beef a low scoring right here 21yard pickup timeout has been called by the Seminoles of Florida State I'll say it Jimmy Jordan is not going for a high percentage he is 7 of 18 but he's making them count 159 yards in the air Brigham Young continues to roll mark.wilson one of the outstanding quarterbacks in the country San Diego State on top of Utah I think Brigham Young won game this year through 50 toothpaste Colorado State leading Air Force later today Washington Huskies down at Terry Donahue UCLA team and Rich Brooks continuing to do a heck the job at Oregon as they lead Washington State tendon up for 10 to 7 I don't know if you saw them score earlier but Missouri is struggling today it has been a tough year for Warren powers now FSU has elected to go for the field goal with five seconds on the clock bill capice junior from Miami who picked off for the Seminoles who has more range than the normal place kicker Davey capela is on to attempt the field goal rich Knoxville the 13 quarterback number 11 will hold we'll be picking from the 41yard line so it will be a 51yard field goal attempt as the Seminoles try to go out leading 1713 five line they're kicking up it's going to be short and so the first half has come to a close in Florida State on the strength of a 53yard bomb from Jordan the hardest Johnson has gone back on top they lead LSU 1413 we'll be back right after this they exceed a halftime score from Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge Florida State seventh ranked and unbeaten on top of LSU 1413 first quarter with Seminole scored on a three yard touchdown pass Jordy the Sam flap after an FF you fumble recovery 7 nothing 2nd quarter LSU controlling the game on the ground hope you guys on a 1 yard touchdown run tied at 77 then David Woodley the quarterback from two yards out extra point no good LMG leaded 13 7 it's made that way so the final minutes of the first half another fumble recovery by Florida State the played immediately following the recovery a 53yard touchdown pass from Jimmy George the hardest Johnson the extra point kick by capela Florida State leads it at halftime 1413 earlier you saw the remarkable partial tour South Carolina beating Notre Dame in South Bend 17 to 3 well Notre Dame came back to get him the Irish winning the game 18 the 17 but a heck of an effort by the Gamecocks of South Carolina who had not lost since an opening day lost to North Carolina coming into this game against Notre Dame

unbeaten Florida State leading in the football game largely because of big play halftime statistics coach LSU controlled the game on the ground it was a stun than disappointing LSU team that win is a halftime dressing room in the figures tell why LSU had 139 yards rushing led in total offense 193 to 181 but what pops out at you is the turnover the number turnovers 3/3 ero that was the difference Prince William's check that that is not Chris Williams that is hardest Johnson hardest Johnson freshman receiver who caught a 53yard touchdown pass and the first half is deep for Florida State and John Bartell will kick it off Johnson goes all the way past the left pass mark to get it he wants to come back to the right he is dragged down wait click and the man who got him is number 84 a freshman defensive end as you look at the LSU defensive line that they were being in Florida State lime and white the big play man Benji Thibodeau defendants balls in his death fast lesson George attea one of the puck low guards in the country Ivan Phillips the right tackle and the right defensive end also the punter and an all Southeastern Conference Player is John Adams Florida State on the warpath but in position as they start from their own fiveyard line if you joined us late any Jordan has gone all the way at quarterback in Florida State you'll quarterbacking systems on first down mark Lyles has a couple out to the settle linebackers for LSU Tommy Frisell is one we remind you 15 LSU players shaved their heads before last week's game Jerry Hill the other linebacker James Britt coming back from a broken hand to play today a cornerback Chris Williams who had a 43yard punt return in the first half Marcus Quin one of an excellent pair of safety men the other is Willie field the free safety on second down eight yards to go from the 7 yard long Jackie flowers and Phil Williams or the wide receiver Jordan gives to the man off the tail and that is Michael white sophomore tailback from Largo Florida get some breathing room across the 10 to the 13 we take another look at hardest Johnson kickoff return the fans are booing the referees call they think that should have been a fumble let's see if we can detect whether it's a good call about here's Johnson going across he lands the ball is declared dead once he hits the ground and it houses out it was dead ball and not a fumble good call he had distant third down now three yards to go Jackie flowers with to the top of your screen the give is allowed and love is the line of scrimmage credit the right side of the defensive line Georgia Kia the nose guard Ivan Phillips the tackle they were there to stop Lyle before he could really get going in on fourth down Ron stark will come on to punt from around the area of his goal line you look at Chris Williams on the left more could Chris false and shut up for this McClure Ron Clark began to punt McClure Ron Clark began to punt well through the end of the first half and he hits the beauty here Williams will take it at his sport he's him they're giving Brent now he find the little running room across the board it is a 42 a 53yard punt for on shark could not have come at a better time for FSU is the defensive lines for Seminole Scott Warren premed student at left we marked my SEC the left tackle they will alternate for tackle Ron Simmons is the nose guard the other starting tackle jeremy midland you'll also see Walter Carter had meant white tackle Slaton he's played very well Arthur Scott is the rushing in the right defensive end guys John on first down for LSU has a couple before ma Tech makes the software fsq call a second down seven guys on in the first half had 13 carries for 85 so make it 14 for 88 now for hokey linebackers and secondary for Florida State Reggie herring is one linebacker he's played well fall throughout the next quarterback as the other line back in the secondary Bobby Butler one cornerback and we'll look at the rest of them in a minute on second down step guys John has about pool I left you coming up with the same offenses look as they carry throughout most of the first guy Jean from his failed back position the rest of the florida state secondary shows ivory till 100 number 36 at one corner and the safety man are month run assort a junior former walkon from pittsburgh who has five interceptions on the year and keep Jones a very very contact oriented and physical strong safety Tracy Porter is the slip back Orlando McDaniel also in the ballgame as roll on third down and overthrow Orlando McDaniel so they went with the pants on third down and it did not pay off as for debate had pressure on anything well LSU is it a triple wing then put motion back and you watch ferocity 53 and summons 50 force him out of the pocket first for house to the linebacker give him credit for the incomplete pass forcing the bad throw the butter is done Adams he has hunted very well in this ball game and Gary Henry Cole for a fair catch and makes it at the 14 yard line the Florida State continues to operate at this advantageous field position after the 36yard punt by adam with the Seminoles leading 1413 near be back you see jampacked Tiger Stadium and that new rules and Florida State once again begins to drive in poor field position second possession of the second half for the Seminoles disappointing in the flat breaks one tackle and gets across the 25 to the 26 before Willie peel made the stop for LSU Jordan to whiting the completion of first down for FSU yeah that's the first series in recent times that they have thrown old course down they have tried to run old first down LS she was in a running defense no gain they go to a passing down LSU double cover they call them in single coverage on that time good completion for universal message of college students send money first and ten from the 26 yt Florida State has not been able to move the football on the ground against LSU defensive line unless use defensive line where it way against the block and spring training on their practicin and they get effective against the run called a spate of courses of passing zombie passing team and alignment step back Jim and it's hard to fire out on run and set back overpass effectively and a good college the third college football team second down eight jimmy dore part of johnson to the top of the screen jackie flowers for the box big test across the 45 to the 48 yard line first down 19 yard picked up Jordan to Johnson and since they've only got 38 yards on the ground they're going to have to keep moving the ball this way you can see Jordan hit Johnson coming across the middle between the linebackers we put stuff on the ball right there good catch by Johnson concentrating turning back to the around buck 306 degrees but controlling the ball Chris Williams hadn't covered but there is no defense for the perfectly thrown bass and the great catch like that flowers to the top of the screen bill Williams for the box white again has dumped behind the line of scrimmage first man there was number 94 Lyman white the defensive end Tommy Frisell put the finishing touches on from his linebacker position watch white 90 for extra football wear get walked to the ground by the fullback but yes up gets involvement in the play along with Brett number level well I had it reversed it was Brazil who got there first and then white along with number 11 James Britt will give the real credit to Tommy Frisell the senior from Athens Texas second down 10 make the drop quite a jacket dumpling it's over his hands this time as this time Johnson was running the deep crossing pattern from the right side of the field best watch Johnson break across the middle and I think we'll see the linebackers in the line of the past where Jordan has to go high with it the ball is high he cannot control it going over the linebacker for sails head incomplete Jimmy Jordan on the game 9 of 21 for 189 yards the calculated gamble by Bobby Bowden he had started Wally Woodham throughout a 10 game winning streak over a twoyear period today he came out with Jimmy Jordan mental health third down Lyle's with the football dumped short of the first down number 90 Dimitri Williams was there so was Albert Richardson and for Bobby battling us back to the punt and LSU will have their full field position like Florida State kick him from the midfield Chris Williams on the left Marcus Quinn on the right Ron stark six punch so far on the day an average of thirty nine point seven yards he has improved steadily with each kick another good one when calls the fair catch them let them go they have a chance to down at deep end they do number26 calling on the football down there was Wade Wallace hit though at the 7 yard line and that is where LSU will start the offense when we come back crowd coming to life 8 minutes 35 seconds to go in the third quarter we have seen both LSU quarterbacks on the day this time it is in zinger and the senior from Baton Rouge gives the Hokie guys on who has been the workhorse for LSU all day Mississippi pounding Vanderbilt and a happy day one of the rare ones this season of the feed flow he's had a tough year second win of the season there is a Southern Miss I said about Wake Forest one of the incredible stories in college football the Deacons under new coach John mackovic in only the second year Zaire mackovic confirmed that football program completely around now on second down LSU with guy hammer guy John again with the football and he cannot move against Ron Simmons and this will bring up third down for LSU let's watch them a test how strong effective he can be saves up and watches the ball care if uses to be blocked Stockton foots off dodge off the no game this Drive began after 47yard punt by Starr Florida State may finally have turned the field position pride they've had trouble all day third down eight guys don has dumped again on the thirty nine shooting the gap was Reggie herring the junior linebacker from Titusville Florida and now it is LSU with must punt the football from very deep in his own territory the man going into the end zone the ticket will be done Adam Adams on the day for kicks forty two point seven yards for tip deep to receive Gary Henry will see whether the Seminoles wants a block or return it looks as though they have chosen to try to return they have Adams is able to kick it away from Henry however and get the good LSU roll the droplet me those in holes will start the offense from the dirty nine after the 41yard punt by jonathan it will still be Jimmy Jordan at quarterback Maryland beating Duke today hairpins have had some rough sledding in the previous school week NC State beating Clemson at Clemson and that is a big win for the Wolfpack a big pie for Pat dye and East Carolina as they tied North Carolina twenty four star heels with 15th ranked on first down live Rick flew for one of the most effective running plays because a for Florida State Willie feel made the tackle but not before Lyles picks up eight it will be second down to all the scores coming up time permitting after this football game ends on the college football scoreboard and you look again at that remarkable score from South Bend Notre Dame coming from behind the beat South Carolina 1817 that 8 yard pickup for Lyles was the longest run of the day for the Seminoles and you see why number 77 Benjy Thibodeau is there to stop riled along with 86 John Adams along with 49 Jerry Hill the LSU defense against the rush has been super LSU playing in Florida State the fivetwo defense penetrating explanting Thibodeau the tackle and hold solo thought apiece trying to get in the back seat Florida steak was hot on third down conversions early in the ballgame now they are only three for 12 as they face third down a long two yard waiting no way Thibodeau was there though was 68 Ivan Phillips the other defensive tackles though was that he is a nose guard not a foot too short again we ain't really fun Phillips is having trouble getting up you can see LSU penetrate in through the gaps or short yardage to try to stop it's all care for no gain and they were successful still fourth down the off the run son who hit his last punt beautiful the nail LMU inside the 10 during the game this time from the 43 yard line of the Tigers left where the ball will be Matt Williams and Quinn or standing campaign almost a high snap start going for the bar he has put them in the coffin once again the hopeless criminals were down fields to down it number 79 was there that was Gary foot 64 Jarvis Bush he was also there you look at Ivan Phillips's they work on him on the sidelines things are getting hot in Baton Rouge he was always an interest in show next Friday night we are back at Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge Louisiana where seventh ranked and unbeaten Florida State Seminoles have LSU Tigers pinned deep in their territory 508 let's to go in the third quarter lourdes a bleeding it's 1413 on first down hokey guys John took the handoff from David Woodley number eight now back in the game at quarterback and guys John picks up about three you look at the back of George if he is hit the big middle guard from Allentown Pennsylvania one of 15 LSU players who shaved their heads last week before the Kentucky game but you know a skinhead a flame dome wasn't enough for George he wanted something a little different that's what you got Ivan Phillips offensive tackle for LSU had cramps in his leg we should see him back in the vault Woodley on second down get away from one man but not enough he's bill short of the 10 yard line Arthur Scott FINA defensive end from Tampa was the first man who got the woodland it's an option play and the defensive end shot number 54 makes an outstanding play he blocked momentarily you'll see him come from the left corner of your screen in and close with it down enough pursuit to get to him no game third down five in this quarter perhaps because the field position the Florida State defense has stiffened against the tiger running game do they go to the air at their own 10 it would be a gamble they do not guys walkers and trucks he does not have the first down telecast is being brought to you as an exclusive presentation of ABC sports now let's pause five seconds to allow our local stations Adams goes deep in his endzone to punt it Gary Henry back to return for Florida State last time the Seminoles tried to set up to return and adam kicked it away from henry this time they do the same thing Henry will have a chance to run this one back get one block up run into the block number 42 back there for Florida State trying to make the block for Gary Henry with Francis color Court and there you see number 64 who made the play Mike Turner a sophomore reserve offensive guard he gets the big tackle and it helps LSU out a little bit with field position after the 41 yard kick by Adams Florida State will start from their 46 it is still Jimmy Jordan at quarterback we have not seen while I wouldn't who normally starts to the terminal and all today he's behind me partiece Johnson good the ball intercepted the ball did not hit the ground really deal with the book book in the thenor great Thank You Man comes up with a very very big LSU defensive you saw hardest Johnson gets behind the quarterback you saw the football hit him in the hands went up in the air it never came down to the ground that really feels granted for the intercepts this is the one time that Georgia's Bowl is outrun by the receiver and the defensive back because Johnson's in behind Williamson has vault has the ball momentarily then his knee picked it up in the air watch the play by field he comes down he realized he runs returns it all the way back to the 45 on first down hokey guys on has for dr. Warren damming the play up at defensive end but this is a big turnaround after playing with poor field position for much of the game Florida State had managed to turn the side and Tim the Tigers back inside their 10 consecutive possessions out there they tried to capitalize the interception has turn old was terrified to because they give up field position it breaks down you morale and files up you pull that's what's happened here three wide receivers in the lineup Carlos Berlocq goes in the back crazy Porter has and as Bobby Butler makes the tackle is down to the 39yard line of fsq excellent timing all that particular play porta was there the defendant as if he was going deep but Allah gave him a cushion and quarterturn in the ballers right old cart and first down at the ball game for LSU they lead in that category ten to eight the floor the tight end back in now on first down woodland the guys 53 is pol kurowsky who held his ground he has played a very good game at linebacker for Florida State and also get credit to part of the defensive tackles Jim he penetrated for Sky John to play inside where the linebackers could make the play Charlie McClendon in his eighteenth year as the head coach here at LSU he's and under pressure the last few years and this is the final year for a man who has emerged throughout his career to be one of the top coaches in the Southeastern Conference second down nine Woodley wants to an attack Gary Henry the defensive back Feld but as we fell down in his ankle whoops : Carson went down to this right and see why exactly why the fans booing Carson number three goes outside the cornerback someplace going deep Henry's on the board is coming into picture they get tangled up let's see if you would call interference here's Carson actually Henry falls down and Crips Carson and the ball could have been completed except for the accidental quick very negligible contact between their feet there was the penalty flag down on the play it appears illegal motion against LSU's declined by Florida State now that will bring up third and nine and possession down for the Tigers see how they have done on third down through the ball game they are four for 10 in the third down conversion category most of those however have been short yardage third downs Porter Carson and McDaniel 21 breathe and 30 football in the ball game Woodley wants Carson he was signing at safety quarter but he had to throw too quickly because the Florida State Rush was a Jim that was a little late to play big rush when they had no time to choose his receiver the mathematics coverage was effective a good call good strategy allows for you saved the safety blitz for certain spot that time Bobby Bowden picks the right one excellent well all the parsed a defective piece Adams began the punt now he is trying to pin Florida State back in for field position again looking for the right corner but it bounces into the end zone so the Seminoles will start the offense from the 20yard line we have one minute remaining in the third quarter of what has been a very eventful football games you look at scores from other games around the country very quickly we will recap the scoring in this game and the first quarter Florida State went out on top after a three yard touchdown pass Jimmy Jordan to Sam black then LSU took over control of the football game on the ground after a 43yard punt return by Judge William hokey guys down scored from one yard out that made it seven to seven then a touchdown by David would leap at LSU on seven Florida State came back after an LSU fumble a 53yard second quarter touchdown pass Jordan the hardest Johnson put the Seminoles on top 1413 a flag is down as on first down from the 25 iting gets five yards Benji Thibodeau mates attack yes Florida State two touchdowns were set up by the state on LSU spark I know they are disappointed but then LSU is disappointed they get a little bit momentum they have field position they can hold them right here they've got a chance to get back in this ball game holding call against Florida State that moves the football back to the 15 yard line there you see the Missouri score and it's been a rough year and ellonija for Warren powers and his brew and they expected much better Jim Dickey the old Kansas State has him much credit to second team the one expected to do much done quite well eighteen yards to go wild breakthrough longestrunning play of the day for the Seminoles as wild get this back out across the 26 and from there it will be secondary for Chris Williams made the Sun when you're running a passing football team you best play normally as a raffle draw and that's about all the Florida State has had any successful down horse down they talk LSU charging across the captain big hole for college hurry up you see heart of Johnson coming into the huddle with the play from coach Bobby Bowden down four yards to go Johnson is to the top of the screen and Jackie flowers just to the bottom and now Jimmy Jordan pulls out from under Center as the third quarter comes win it so we'll be back to the fourth quarter in Baton Rouge with Florida State leading forces a visiting college football team in the entire sport coming into this game Bobby Bobby privately promised that with Jimmy Jordan at quarterback he would come out ripping as we enter the fourth quarter Jordan in the air is 10 for 23 but for a hundred ninety one yard he has hit some bombs enough to have the Seminoles on top 1413 on second down four from the 26 yard line mark Lyles with the football gets it close to the 30 and now it will be third down and a short two yards to go over the first down you look at statistics in the ballgame so far Laurent strain has jumped ahead in Poland yard it's 250 to the 223 still what pops out Matthew is 6 LSU 3 turnover brawler state 1 first out LSU meeting 10 to 8 just what we expected in productivity of the running a passion for each team another NBA a doubleheader next week starting at 12:30 check your local listings for the game and the time in your area Jimmy Jordan growing on third and short and Becky flower has the football at the 35 yard LSU another big play for the Seminoles as the bomb once again work this time flowers from Jordan 37 yards LSU is going to rush cliff there at man's the man written on the Levin is covering flowers let's watch the the Matt right here on the left of your screen 23 flowers watches concentrate to the out ones of all you have to slow up a grip trying to catch up could not get involved in the foot and the pass was right on the money now make Jordan eleven of Duty Florida Florida State opportunity god yard long he wants cartas Johnson jump johnson is guest the freshman he's in behind britt again once again bobby bowden jim I've heard him lecture Brent cook he says this if your secondary doesn't think deep when I talk my receivers charge off that lively gonna go deep look at the men let's watch it again from the end zone you can see the the individual competition between grit number eleven and dumps and a Frenchman is in behind but he can't control second down ten from the 35 dominus the titan off the hands of Phil Williams not the tight end wide receiver Williams from 87 wide receivers going to play to cross the middle the linebacker if the quarterback wants to throw the ball between the linebackers he throws a little bit high and the Williams takes a good blow right in the back got Quinn number 40 meanwhile flag was down in the marker will be for five yards against ffu illegal motion against the Seminole I don't know if you thought the man another LSU if you saw the man standing behind Bobby Bowden in our chat again with the hat on with Wally wood within the starting quarterback through every game on a thin gamewinning speak to the general he has not played at all today Jordan then you just have to give credit to the receiver for water stayed in if they run their fast routes as well at any football team ahead take William stomach Winnetou with covering man oh man again and you when you cover mantoman you have to protect the inside watch Williams get a hands on the football and then the concentration of flowers right here you'll see the greatest number 22 is Krystal to play he deflects the watch the concentration right there by flowers excellent receiver takes it on into the endzone for the touchdown the kick is up by cap Elenin good so Florida State now lead 2113 with 1351 to go want to know how Jimmy Jordan knows he just threw a touchdown pass somebody told him that's how watch Georgia team Georgia T is making a great effort trying to get back and forth going to throw a little bit sooner and maybe have an incomplete pass Jordan is very very tough minded young man bill cook he kicked it off for Florida State Chris Williams will down it in the end zone so while Jackie flowers was scoring a touchdown for Florida date Jimmy Jordan who threw the touchdown pass had a closeup played for threat yes Jackie flowers on the sideline this coming Monday night on ABC of NFL Monday Night Football Seattle Seahawks against the Atlanta Falcons 9 o'clock news on Jimmy Zorn and Steve Largent up against the Bartkowski led thousands who made it to the playoffs last year LSU under the gun they trail 2113 at their own 2013 51 left in the football game Woodley at Corbin great play on the corner by ivory Java average Kilohana one field with a quarterback running out the red run all the way there you can see the Florida State coaches trying to get their blocking straightened out against the pass rush quick parody is talking about the safety blitz right there's a duplex middle linebacker blitz him being the middle linebacker no start study second down 10 for LSU Carson and safety border both to the top of your screen Tigers need to get something going they have not moved the football much in the second half pump fake across the 45 a Florida State the 44 yard line a 37 yard complete let's watch it from the endzone you seen Henry number 40 is going to intercept the past and switch down let's see if you can set this board is going to intercept the past but the ball is right on target if Carson makes the reception a big game for LSU and fun assort leveled carson so after the 40 yard touchdown pass from Jordan the flowers lfyou in trying to come right back Carlos Carson Derek catch that now Woodley turns it up inside and has only about a yard and Ron Simmons is beginning to make his awesome presence Bellary Simmons is the one that Charlotte McClendon told me he was really concerned about they had to keep him in hold TT V Bobby Bowden told in the spring that he disrupts the offense in college him they can't run anything when he's on the defensive feed he's an outstanding football player by the way he's won three consecutive jebel a defensive player of the game award it's on Carson is to the top of the screen and Chaffey quarter is to the button second down Kim he throws it right to bonus interception of the year for beau McCoy and he picked his way back across midfield to the 47 yard line before David Woodley himself made the stuff for LSU 25yard return of the interception by monk connoisseur who is one of the nation's leaders in this department it's a mistake to over lead a man crossed in the middle you keep the ball low low file that was tried in was the target but Montessori intercepted the pass and makes a nice run return he was trying to go to number 89 Lafleur the tight end but LSU doesn't have the same kind of practice game as Florida State they don't practice it as much it isn't as big a part of their offense and you expect mistakes when you have to go to the air first down from the 48 miles with the football the last time the Seminoles had it they went 80 yards in seven plays and took two minutes to do our victories two long completions Jordan the flowers scores from the top ten Alabama one so different Rex Southern Cal and California still tied up in the third quarter Houston beat Arkansas earlier you saw it on ABC the Razorbacks had a lastsecond chance to die but ish Ordonez 51yard field goal was no good the first time Ordonez had missed in 17 kick second down five to go now for the Seminoles at the 43 yard line of LSU there is month on a sword from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania a former walkon with an outstanding free safety yt he's going to be dumped Jerry Hill was there so was Lyman white aw I'm aborted to the made the interception walk owned as GM as mentioned before water state is keeping the bar on the ground empire to run out the clock make as much of the minutes off the clock as a bust again LSU meeting two scores to come back to win one is going for to double the time Bobby Bowden by his own admission is the conservative coach when he has a lead he s jumped offside for LSU that's a smart play third down and five he staggered this back cap they didn't going on the quick count they went to a long count LSU defense jumped all sides first down so big first down for the Seminoles keep this possession alive I was just going to say coach the conservatism that Malvin espouses once he has a lead he says is a big factor in his team somewhat reduced offensive statistic from a year ago maybe a little too early here to go into a shell de and they're not going completely in it because Geordi one flower and almost paddock good coverage downfield Oh Williams was there Britt was there and so was Willie reporters really flowers got hit right on the hand but he couldn't control it because of the defensive players of LSU you talk about concentration all day John from the freshman freshman will learn it there's Johnson coming in with the play from Bobby Bowden Jackie flowers has it right now he certainly does he drove expect the reception he had today you watch him and see that his eyes watch the ball all the way into his hands until he looks annoyed the best illustration sports with the 40yard touchdown passes the moments ago from Jimmy for second and 10 and Jordan wants to go deep again this time he's going to go underneath the flowers comes back to make the catch and you saw the big cushion that Flowers has when you've gotten them to think deep Gary Hill made the stop they've got to give you something underneath let's watch it from the ground level and flowers will push deep you'll get the defensive backs to thinking deep so if they'll retreat then when he curls up he comes back to the bowl let's watch you come back towards the passer which gives him the decided advantage excellence rolled find reception and a big first down for Florida State fifth catch of the day for 148 yards for Jackie flowers first down for Florida State from the 21 Jordan now 13 of 20 for 285 yard first and goal inside the ten Willie peel made the tackle tree here in the Florida State offense is starting to control the football game let's watch it on ground level you see excellent walks by the left side of the Florida State Line good kickout blocked by the fullback plows and fighting cut inside of his block back outside to pick up his flankers locked and goes all the way to the 7 8 yard line Jim I think we should Mitchell right here that Jimmy George holds the world record for the amount of yardage one season four thousand and something yards in senior year at Tallahassee Leon high school and the Florida State record had been set the year before by the other FSU quarterback wood on 1st and goal from the 8 whiting comes back to the middle of the field and gets down to about the 5 that is Ron Simmons it appears that he is being administered to for perhaps a cramp hot day like this given stadium like this closed in it both in very little wind hearted he played likely oppressed hopefully that ball it is no so much from every side hardest Johnson to the top of your screen and Jimmy Jordans backs away from the line of scrimmage there in the student in the Tiger Stadium it could be the noise made it difficult for him to get his signals for the rest of the team so we'll be back in a moment with FSU leading on cylinders and mobile again will expect to see him back in the ballgame look at the bicep he can benchpress 550 pounds unbelievable second down goal now for Florida State from the eighth Jordan threw it into the middle of the crowd trying to hit hardest jump from Jerry Hill was the man who got a hand on the football he will force the ball warning he will bounce one thing this kept him as a substitute for their quarterback he going in and relief rock and roll the ball in the crowd right there I have been intercepting LSU dependents they're the same class those definitely scored the first touchdown and LSU had made a mistake from their past couple that Phil Williams for the top of your cream Jackie flowers to the broken glass intersect Lyman white with the ball he made him a fake trying to run it out and a flag is down as white gets attacked only for the three yard line Jim I would guess it could either be umpire calls that four if neither offensive pass interference I believe that's what it is let's see if we can detect it again over to the left of your screen it looks like it's going to be passed often if interference Bob the office and back in the left corner of your screen now Lyman White had a chance to down this football and set LSU up at the 20 yard line well that's a tough call he wasn't sure he caught the ball in the field of play Jim and took it in the end zone which could've been a safety so this without risk in any chance he came back out first down from the three yard line in here in the football game for LSU he wants to throw from Vincent Nikolas Carson good defense by Florida State on authority in the deep zone and had to be on the ball all the way right now at the time that waters fate will vote a doubledouble to receive looks of eight minutes to play leading by eight points force the ball throw inside where you have a chance to your linebackers to make the play Carson might have felt more at home over there on the FSU been seeing from West Palm Beach and they discovered him look in the film of another player saw what filthy had an awesome scholarship LSU second down ten guys John was there warned was there Arthur Scott number 54 was there and so was Walter Carter Walter Carter 76 a senior defensive tackle from Richmond Virginia has played very well he's been in the backfield he's been able to get penetration against the run which is what you must allow as an optin to you he's been given from Houston that place there's one of those soughtafter properties in college football anybody who can do the kind of job he has done in Florida State is regarded as the kind of here for history everywhere in swinger throws it out of bounds and that was third down so now LSU will have a punting situation Carter dumped in from her back in the end zone but no flag went down then the two things that we say in coaching we start out say let's go beat outfits and we're going that ball game we're not going to beat ourselves we're not going to give them an easy touchdown LSU has done both you need two touchdowns and they're comfortable tough spot for John Adams the senior defensive end from de Ritter Louisiana hunting from the back line and his eighth point of the day sails out to the 40yard line good kick from left we do see that Gary Henry has a wall Jesse miles was demand he knocked Henry out of bounds so after the 38yard punt by Adam and the short run back by Henry Florida State will start at the 29 when we come back the man on the Left he's on the rise his stock is rising a man on the right is at the end of a long and illustrious career Bobby Bowden Charlie human being to sign football coach first down for Florida State from the 29 wait sit down to the 24 yard line Michael whiting has stuck his head in and worked hard today Florida State for the longest time could get nothing going on the ground now they've started to move the ball reasonably well in that department that will depict up to five it is second down five we've got seven minutes 16 quarters for me Jim whiting was a knockedup fullback and moved to payback for this game and a smart move by Bobby's out they Knolls are sent at tailback we feed Lyles the fullback plowing ahead and he's very close to a Florida State first down before the season Florida State's starting tailback from a year ago home Johnson left the football team went home to Lake Hamilton Florida then Greg Ramsey had the job he tore up a knee against Virginia Tech three games ago so the Seminoles are down to third string in the tailback boy Jim I think it's evident that the momentum is team so drastically the quarter state which has very little or no success running the football now the momentum the fortunes have changed LSU get discouraged Florida State is fired up right now and consequently they get movement and George on the ground a lot of people say that this is an impossible place for a visiting team to play my opinion when one statistic I found remarkable LSU has beaten only three teams with winning records in the last five years so to some extent I think the idea that this was a terrible place to try to come visit for Florida State was a bit of a myth waiting pounds inside and gets three yards down to the 16 yard line I'm not saying that LSU is a weak football team just to Charlie McClendon has been outgunned a little bit going against some of the top teams in the game chopped Johnny Mack is one of the most popular and admired and respected people in the coaching profession long illustrious career as you've already measured him tighten up in his 18th year at LSU time permitting college football scoreboard will follow this game immediately meanwhile we'll continue to keep you uptodate on as many scores as possible on second down seven that was fighting with the football he has the yardage down to the 16 yard line as the game comes to a close frank rolls and I will be choosing by Chevrolet most valuable players for both sides Florida State and LSU $1,000 scholarship in the name of each will go to his respective schools general scholarships on them from there into the hands of a deserving student from the overall city by feeding or student kinds of things there's Jimmy Jordan he's a hot candidate as he gives cook waiting and waiting on third down he's short of a first down as he moves the football to the middle of the field the field goal unit will come on him pops out told me this voices I was looking my neck right in the news by starting Jordan fantasy the first time I think that he's old fall back for the entire game since the two offers been playing there together for three years my knowledge that is exactly correct calculated gamble he came out in Jordan in the quarterback role and his up with him all the way just felt like this would be Jimmy Santa game this is a 30yard field goal drive for sapelo and big at the third kick is good the Florida State has extended the lead the 2413 with less than five minutes to go we'll come back to Adela's used last yes after this repeats on the right to kick it number fourteen deep to receive it his freshman running back Jen theme I'll report the winning touchdown a week ago against Kentucky gets it back to the 30 yard line miles was a key figure in the first half even though he handled the ball on only one play as you look at Davey capela because it was a fumbled exchange between a quarterback and Jesse mile which gave Florida State the football toward the end of the first half and set up a 53yard touchdown pass Jimmy Jordans our hardest Johnson then puts the Seminoles back on top of the game after they trail thirteen seven college football 79 tomorrow fighting highlights over all those of all those games over most of our ABC stations Texans of college football 79 in your area look at Scott Lauren and almost had an interception on that pass intended for Tracy Porter from Stephenson Jim and recapping no LSU is going to think of what happened to we had the game going our way in the first half we were leading by six points we were going for another touchdown we left it on the ground water state hits a touchdown right before the half they went in with momentum and that's all she wrote one team is explosive and the other is that has made a difference today second down 10 out the midfield any finger is going to bill the air I would think an LSU will try to keep their hopes alive with a quick score this presents the problem through the attack blocking of the authentic lines LSU broader state can ignore the run charge across you have a good jump on the pass rush and limits anything at the time that he has to select the 19 yard pickup on that play in fingers now for 12 when he throws into the ground again intended for a fee for well you're out he was there to come Jim let me just mention it one thing it happens to football coach he plays a certain style of defensive backfield play against the receivers on the B team that he's working against all week and you probably receive us the older son you up against the four or four and four three receiver and they run right by you and that's probably what happens in this game today LSU thought they could play that style of play but they'd haven't been able to work against that type of receiving with the feed not more from Lake Charles Louisiana and his cat for 22 yards lose the football down to the 28 yard line let's watch the Daniel 30 to go over in the middle the best place to throw on a prevent defense is deep behind the linebackers drop the ball walton rivals the linebackers and brothers lately you can see that wouldn't I miss being a has to lob it over the linebackers a good concentration by McDaniel now in familiar wants timeout so with three minutes 52 seconds remaining in Florida State leading at 24 13 Steve Ensminger will come to talk to Charlie McClendon the reason Jim that he didn't like the play called was the double coverage no both live receiveth a line back to drop sneak over there's a tiny and so that they could defend against his three first line receivers so he very wise which that I can't afford an interception here he calls timeout before going over poked off into quarters coaches and say hey fellas coach we've got double coverage what do we gonna do a mark the Florida State's explosiveness to Seminole struggles with a sluggish running game and poor field position through much of today's game but in total offense they lead with 386 yards to 311 for LSU it all turned around from that fumble to ride the goal to have LSU leading going in for the second touchdown the third touchdown of the game they fumbled and in one play one play that's advantage of a submitted past attack they can score in a hurry it happened so fast the fumble by mile the 53yard touchdown pass Jordan to Johnson and suddenly Florida State which would appear to be in trouble back on top and then inside the 15yard line extra timings are in stinger and McDaniel he waited our quarterback Israel waited for my Daniel came inside the linebacker and had the ball right over my rifle the number for completion second cat Orlando McDaniel six 175 pounds back in here to enjoy his contribution for the next year that time in swinger throws the ball out of the end zone and out of bounds so that will make it second down 10 LSU has the football at the 12 and a half yard line of Florida State as they try to get back to within 24 20 there's Jimmy Jordan and he is the Chevrolet most valuable player in the ballgame for Florida State Bobby Bowden was a calculated gamble today elected to go with Jordan who had not started the football game this year and he is responding to my 13 out of 30 in the air but he's not a percentage Pat he's a bum 285 yards and three touchdowns Jones and swallow behind infinity lost it Carlos here that was a thing of beauty what we called alleyoop a is being approves of all immediately have to step on a quick drop back Parsa that's locked in he's going to go to the outside looking over at the inside shoulder and Meghan's goal a top bottle of 21 is plaintive anthem and he doesn't see the ball touch that LSU will have to go for two and then to have an old sidekick second touchdown catch of the year for Carlos Carson and just like that LSU's back in the football game guys on in motion he wanted to hit mercury in the corner of the end zone and couldn't get so that will leave it at 24 19 LSU will need a touchdown but there's 322 plenty of time remaining will be back to Tiger Stadium for the final moment the LSU scoring drive six plays 70 yards took a minute 31 seconds to touchdown a 13yard pass from Ensminger to that man Carlos Carson you see his statistics on the day four catches for 78 yards and with that catch Carlos Carson has suddenly loomed up as a candidate for Chevrolet MVP for LSU will wait with plenty of football left miss Johnson drop at the 20 be assured that LSU will be grabbing at the football they'll be telling their defensive players hey we got the game bill the ground forced to kick but at the same time this product jar the ball loose and have excellent field position chance to win this game six points winter the capacity of Bill Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee where the Seminoles are used to playing is about 48,000 here 30,000 more people and those 30,000 more will be making a lot of noise for the next few minutes so this is attempt for the poise of unbeaten and seventh ranked Florida State there's a man who's brought him this far today Vinny torch as only a couple and suddenly the LSU defense which looks flat grew up some of this fourth quarter has reason to be motivated again because they face an answer back in the ball game you look at the big score from up in South Bend South Carolina led at one point in that ballgame 17 to 3 Notre Dame evidently had the go for to hizo this course touchdown or the second touchdown to win the game both teams have two timeouts remaining then on eight big black across the 50 to the LSU 48 29 yard completion you live by the past you die by the fact Bobby Brown says we gonna throw we're going to force you to defend the field from sideline to sideline in deficit if this is the post corner white flowers go hard to the inside it freezes Williams many comes back to the outside before number 22 Chris Williams can get back into place excellent role very fine fabric six catches 174 yards on the day for Jackie flowers with a potion fourthyear Lyle down to the 46 yard line biggest contribution of the day by the FSU running back they have not fumble that is a key factor if I said earlier that we look at cool thank you up the mp7 well as the fans watch the scores every game Jim don't beat yourself don't turn the ball over and by all means don't allow take what don't give them an easy touchdown LSU has two timeouts remaining the clock is running as Florida State keeps moving the football this time Wiles on the Statue of Liberty and he's got a lot of running inside the 20 Robert de Rudy and Chris Williams were the men who finally brought him down a 28yard pickup for Lyle and that may be the straw that broke the camel's back that's your limited life obviously LSU was penetrating across the line of scrimmage and his jaw dropped back and put the ball on his hip louse picked it off shuttle the defense fourth quarter update on the Southern Cal California game the Golden Bears giving the Trojans all they can handle 17 the warden Paul McDonald against rich Campbell those are collector and quarterback while rounding forward inside the 15 of their feet a minute time a minute for LSU still has not used one of their two timeouts Wiles on the day now 16 carries for 86 yards and that has taken cement for him to reach those two just because the calculated risk Bobby Bowden starting image Jordan for the first time after the other start of would've had won 10 consecutive ballgames is something that a lot of production better believe it he hung it all out here today Michael White outside to the 10 yard line Chevrolet most valuable players in the game we've already mentioned for Florida State it is Jimmy Jordan the quarterback for LSU the man who got them back into it momentarily Carlos Carson great little wide receiver who had four catches for 78 yards in the football game and his touchdown just a few moments ago closed it to 2419 now with Florida State controlling third down two yards to go at the 11 yard line LSU has used one of their two timeouts but there are only 30 seconds remain again I think we all recap to the fans who go on the slate LSU was in control of the game if course a looks like they had complete control they were going in from a third touchdown they fumbled in one place Jimmy Jordan hit Johnson or a touchdown pass the goahead 14 to 13 and from that point on disappointed LSU team went into the dressing room came out and it was a different part of a team it's definitely a different LSU game in the Steven Tucker hey let's speculate for a moment Florida State wins this game they are seven and over remaining Cincinnati South Carolina at Tallahassee Memphis State at Tallahassee and at floor perhaps to suffice game left against South Carolina in Tallahassee if the Seminoles go 11 and up they will be in the same kind of position that Maryland was two years ago unbeaten but will one of the three major bowl games cotton Suter take a chance on them we don't know how it goes yeah Orange Bowl Scouts have watched the Seminole flood they would prefer not to take a team from within the state of Florida but they might have to take Florida State if the Seminoles go 11 enough the reason Jim is pressured broader state will deserve LSU uses their last timeout as they force the fourth down for Florida State so with 25 seconds left and the score on fourth down Florida State went with a running play rather than the kick a field goal Ricky Williams was trapped in his own backfield and dumped for a 10yard loss back to the LSU 21 yard line and with 17 seconds left even finger will have one or two last chances to put the ball up dividing it somebody beat and get LSU back in the football game I've just got gen players on the field LSU just have skin players fine is not in the ball game three of them are wide receivers he wants Carson and as another interception the seventh interception of the year for a month gonna sort what a game he played we gave to seve MVP award to Jordan and he certainly deserved it but this man had two interceptions a fumble recovery and was all over the field free safety is just the free lift just what the turn of three means he play all over the field watch the quarterback when he pitches off on the oxen nothing tackle loud screaming did he close one side to the other he breaks for the school the quarterback and get there perfectly played by him of that particular day we've seen some remarkable individual performances Jordan Jackie flowers Carlos Carson a TEM Simmons both middle guards running back Lyles and guys in and that man bobby bowden the offense had been under wraps a little bit the perfect game for the season and now as jordan falls on the ball the clock will run out and that'll do it LSU moves to 4 and 3 on the season Florida State goes to 7 and OH and yes America the seventh ranked Seminoles are forreal so they have passed the toughest test so far this year they have come here to LSU they must do it every year for the next four years they have beaten LSU 24 to 19 Bobby Bowden gets a ride off the field and a disappointed man the fighting Tigers from LSU go out the other side right now let's go to our studios in New York Creek sample and Dave dials for further updates on college football today",

  "transcript": "as the Steelers meet the one team that's been toughest to beat for them here in Pittsburgh in fact in the Central Division only the Oilers have beaten the Steelers in Pittsburgh and they've done it three times working with me farmer allpro of Merlin Olsen and on a day like this even here some of the oldtimers say hey I'd like to pull on the pads and be down there and get a shot at tackling the likes of Earl Campbell I would like to be down on the field just briefly but then come right back up here because one of the exciting things about being here is that I don't have to tackle number 34 dick I've never seen a runner dish out the punishment to defensive players at Campbell dishes out and he is just awesome those huge thighs and the tremendous shoulder strength he really puts it argument that's quite a high comment and Terry Bradshaw man when he decides to run has been a tough runner and he's coming off a mild injury the toe is okay very concerned his teammates were upset he left the field against New England but he says he is feeling better I asked him he big a run fullspeed and he kind of smiled is it not less they chase me but they do rely on his leadership tremendously I think the most effective quarterback certainly the most effective quarterback in football last year and he's off to a blazing start in 1979 first Bradshaw blessed with two outstanding receivers some say the best pair in the National Football League and that's all he has today stalwart them Swan if one of those is hurt he's going to have to go to Randy Grossman who's a tight end I'll have to move outside both Stallworth and Swan are playing injured today but they're real troopers great athletes see Steeler fans get revved up with the introduction of their Pittsburgh team of course this is the first home game since they won the Super Bowl will reminded that Pittsburgh will be attacking an oiler area defensively the deep secondary that bum Phillip says is his biggest improvement Phillips went out of his way along with coach Maya soon help beef up the secondary of the oiler team they did it by adding a couple Vernon Perry who came to them from Canada number 33 and they've elevated JC Wilson to a starting position Wilson a young man who has better speed than what they've had in there they're not quite positive of what they've got they do feel they're going to be more aggressive in a secondary that should be helpful a quick look because injuries the Pittsburgh personnel could be a factor today some of the outstanding names for the Super Bowl champions will not be playing today and many will only play in an emergency we'll be right back mirror mirror on the wall who's the toughest dealer of them all when it starts to rain the Steelers start to bite the hole yeah they do Uniroyal presents the Steeler radio it's built tough with two steel belts and it's tough to beat when you look at its price you want to see a cowboy feed a Steeler like you know oil stealer you want a tough tire at a price that's fair you want you know loyal there that's Cathy Willis she teaches at our school I bet she's worried now about that problem dandruff or hers I wish he'd asked me mr. O's what shampoo do you think IRA Troy Pegram does it really work well in a national survey three out of four dermatologists judged the medicated ingredient integrant effective in fighting even problem dandruff I'll give it a test how does that dandruff problem I'll give Tegra and a plus mr. Owens prove it to yourself Tegra Newark's who'd ever think a car that looks like this could get good gas mileage like this based on EPA estimates the Porsche 924 can go 278 miles in the city or 524 miles on the highway with just a single time gasps the Porsche 924 who ever thought a Porsche could be this practical come off this thick rise lather holds so strong these men can't even shake it off I can't even throw it off nothing is happening this rise lather holds strong to your finger technical director sound Akita so director Mary Buda coming up in director Mary Buda coming up in this second week of the NFL season the Houston Oilers and the Pittsburgh Steelers sellout crowd Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh to see the Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers and the Houston Oilers members of the AFC Central Division Dick Enberg with Merlin Olsen welcome to this what should be a bruising battle in this second week coming in a fill season the Steelers tick it off Matt Barr hi short kick Ronnie Coleman no it's taken out of his rest by Tim Wilson at the 15 the 20 he slides out across the 25 to the 26 yard line and the Oilers offense on to the field with number 7 Dan Pastorini at quarterback NFL Rookie of the Year former Heisman winner NFL rushing champion or old Campbell at running back along with Tim Wilson in essence of blocking back is Wilson number 45 receivers can borough veteran at one wide spot with Billy white shoes Johnson 84th the other Mike barber the tight end number 86 first barber and Mike Wagner the safety man of the Steelers embroiled in considerable conversation during the winter we'll talk more about that later a whistle on the opening play from scrimmage as referee Pat Haggerty checks with his crew and it's illegal procedure against the Oilers that's a tough way to start things they're the men zavier shirts Conway Peters Marshall pool Creed and Lewis collaborating with a referee Pat Haggerty that's a not a good way to open a ballgame early you don't want to open with a mistake for sure let's take this time to look at the offensive line for the Houston Oilers the Oilers have had to rebuild a little bit they lost the whole left side of that line they now have gray and Heyman over there in place of Samson and Rena pocket Center and Fisher and towns on the other side of the line the Oilers that comefrombehind winner last week in Washington against the Steelers they needed overtime to beat New England and their opener first and 15 no surprise there it's Campbell out to the 26 yard line a gain of about or second down and 11 as we looked at the Steeler defense the people at Earl is going to be trying to run over today a very substantial Steeler defensive line Beasley has got in place of Elsie Greenwood who's out with a knee injury Joe green Steve Furness John bonacic some new names in there but some real quality second down 11 pitted Pastorini basing of past situation he's 12 for 30 last week give us the table as Tom Beasley 65 spearheaded the charge oh.what linebackers for the men of the Blackshirts am Lambert and Cole Golda's beat mountjames at that right side and the deep backs for the Steelers Johnson and blunt at the corners in shell and Wagner third and nine fast rainy has three wide receivers the football Pastorini sets an alarm problem stick he had a viral infection attack one of the nerves in his throwing arm and he's had trouble getting back into shape for this year talked to him yesterday and again this morning he is improving says it won't be long before he'll be flowing at maximum efficiency but right now he's still kind of getting used to it clip parsley at an excellent week forty five point six last week in Washington and Jim Smith who was not going to play back at the 34 of Pittsburgh beautiful kid Smith at the 22 would appear like oh excuse me dick would appear that someone was off to the line too quickly and partially not allowed to leave except for the end men until the ball is kicked Pittsburgh apparently happy with their field position just as soon not have another shot at that return a lacquered he's going to talk with Terry Bradshaw and here it is the National Football League microphone inoperative Swan and showers come out on the left side back Rocky Bleier starting it's half of the 38yard line a short game Franco Harrison Sidney Thornton are the running backs with quarterback Terry Bradshaw there's the offensive backfield set for the Steelers wide receivers stallworth and Swann what a combo and Randy Grossman Cunningham it tied in there's the offensive line for the Steelers veteran crew Korb cold person Webster Mullins Peterson two new names in their horses and Peterson second down Norton who scored the two touchdowns at New England went on a rush in the other on a pass wide open gets it to the 41 yard line will be third down and six veteran defensive unit for the Oilers certainly up front two of the finest defensive linemen in football curly Koch album but they young man Andy Doris on the other side and outstanding linebackers Washington Bingham a new man in their art stringer Brazil Robert Brasilia Bradshaw covers it at the 39yard line and Andy Doris to make sure that Bradshaw didn't take off with it Elsie Greenwood on the sidelines some rate him the best defensive lineman in the NFL but will not play today a chance to see why that ball was dropped it appeared to be a bad snap Bradshaw and Mike Webster don't have that problem very often they played together a long while goes to show you even between experienced players that can be problems Colquitt delivers a short punt slides it off the side of his foot and out of bounds about where the Oilers gave up the football after their first possession just inside their own 30 either team able to pick up a first down we have no score in Pittsburgh Steen is some mighty fine football last year I can tell you the Houston Oilers are glad it's not the scene of another rainstorm in 26 degrees temperatures this is more their kind of day it is a perfect football day sunny skies the high 60s second possession for the Oilers it is Tim Wilson figuring that Pittsburgh defense with Keon Campbell Wilson who logged the ball only four times in the opener against the Redskins hit by furnace and ham one of the interesting things about this Steeler defense defensive lineman on this team are trained to play all four positions and when you have an injury you don't worry about it George perlis the defensive coordinator said hey I hate to see LC Greenwood on the sidelines but we've got some great people I want to see him play to the right side and Earl Campbell for every inch in this first corner Vanna sak and Lambert storming into close the whole Earl Campbell of course known for running over defensive players and has not done that so far in the ballgame the Pittsburgh defense I think pretty well juiced up for the game they came in ready look at two of them right there to meet him at the line of scrimmage they're not going to give him an extra yard as they drive him toward this sideline turned him toward the sideline to put him down third down six receivers my Koran saying his first action of this season did not play this yes looping around the outside to make the tackle I think we'll see a lot is stunning between a defensive lineman as the Pittsburgh Steelers try and put additional pressure there you see it on the outside defensive end coming to the inside locks up both the tackle and the guard furnace looping around to the outside does a beautiful job of getting on Pastorini and had passed everything had time to throw borough had gotten open so the pressure took it away from him fires made a kick from around his own Tim Smith back at the pittsburgh 41 wobbly boom 42 said Thompson made the tackle stay Furness logged the Steeler sack and that puts the Oilers in a bit more that ought to be quite a quinella sports world next Saturday from bowling and some of the great names in bowling hi die Carrie Bradshaw first quarter no score Gordon trouble on the handoff and portent corralled by Greatland Bingham 54 both of the defensive linemen on the right side birthday and Curley cope having a little trouble with Bradshaw's count as they lean in on Webster we got a look at them going offsides they're going to mark it up against the Houston Oilers give you a chance to look at it at home watch them as they anticipate the count they stagger a little bit I will let the referee tell you but they both apparently were guessing on the count Bradshaw threw them off and pulled them off sides got a burst in prior that's got it down as you like to have it Bradshaw does with Pittsburgh the long soda Stallworth at the 11:00 but it's called back boy you hate to see that beautiful execution Bradshaw right on the money to John Stallworth and you got to walk all the way back up the field one of the offensive lineman have used his hands a little too effectively we had a chance to look at the center Mike Webster on that lacked last play maybe we'll get a chance to see the holding I don't think it was on Webster's he did a beautiful job watch Webster as he takes curly Cole pair pushes him off gets excellent position on it pushes him again getting a little help from 77 Steve person Webster doing a great job here obviously not him but they called the penalty on it was on 55 John Cole Berlin and how Webster has developed now in his sixth year out of the University of Wisconsin made allpro last season and especially on that odd man defense he really is tough against that nose guard isn't first down and force that one incomplete at the 37yard line lynn swann wellcovered a trio of white shirts walking number 88 Swan it'll be second down and 15 frets looked and looked and looked at plenty of time but simply unable to find anyone open and gun that one and that was a dangerous pass but Terry's arm is so strong that he's not afraid to throw some of those dangerous passes occasionally gets him into trouble but as in that case his receiver had a shot and no one else Bradshaw who led the Steeler team to nine victories in ten games here at home last year nine and one three rivers in for the Steelers they appeared to be offside and flags are down as Thornton powers to the 48 yard line and again the oiler is a bit too eager and jumped at the count album Bethea jumping up on the right side and you can hear that putt conduct a staggered count watch but they on the right side of your screen as he thinks he's got the snap count takes the one step Webster alertly snaps the ball to Bradshaw and they'll mark off five yards gonna be second in 1065 defense sitting down here's the first score of the day from New England Patriots on the board with a Steve Grogan to Harold Jackson 49 yard touchdown pass what an emotional game they played against these Pittsburgh Steelers last Monday night and to wonder if they'd be able to bounce back but apparently they're doing it and again the Oilers offside intended for Stallworth but this time it was number 67 Mike stems Ruud a rookie from Iowa State he was also the man they call Mongo got to wonder if Bradshaw hasn't crossed them up he usually does not bark his signals quite as aggressively and of course drawing the young rookie off here he gets his third offsides on the oiler defense and boy those are the kind of mistakes that kill you you're playing well defensively you hate to give up that pre yardage and for the Steelers number 20 Rocky Bleier makes his first appearance of this new season former Vietnam veteran like a third guard second m5 Harris field and here's how to bounce at the 40 just shy of the but dot by JC we'll send a micron first report from the Silverdome today the liens have taken the early lead against the Redskins manny ricardo 27yard field goal Rocky Bleier into hell Paris on that play comes out Thorton back in on third and one wire of course recovering from a knee problem that kept him out of the preseason and out of the opener and they they have missed his performance he's one of the great blockers in the game and also a great team leader to tie tension there Cunningham and Grossman and again the Oilers are offside partner first down at the Bradshaw really has a number on the oiler defense as he's able to get them off again and again and again with that staggered count watch him here he's not even bobbing his head he's doing it all with his voice right there gets them off quickly calls again and then something happens that is very dangerous a lot of the Oilers relaxed knowing they were offsides Thornton took advantage of that plunging into the end zone watch Thornton sliding over behind the fake to Franco Harris off tackle behind Steve Corson who gets a block to the outside he really accelerates great thighs runs a lot like Robert Newhouse dick he doesn't date let's listen to Bradshaw pick him up that time flag down again tackled by Reinfeld and perry now let's check the penalty illegal procedure stealers so twice Bradshaw has hit Stallworth and then Swan to get Pittsburgh into deep boiler territory and both throws have been called back in check Noel's brow furrows a bit deeper this is not the kind of game we would expect from to polish the veteran teams the mistakes have been really the dominant here in the early going Pittsburgh twice apparently getting into range for some scoring and being called back on their own mistakes and the Oilers have been offside what five times already in this game first and goal no its first and 15 New Orleans takes the lead at Green Bay on a field goal by Tony Galbraith of 23 yards of Galbraith kicking field goals something's wrong with the Saints Burks laban screen the Harris 30 21st tear us out of bouncing when he gets a full head of steam he can be mighty rough Franco Harris one of the most productive backs in all of football and one of the most durable one of the things that happens to you when you play against this Pittsburgh offense dick they've got such great speed on the outside that they've really lengthen you up they send those receivers down they're getting double coverage at least on one side sometimes on both sides that opens up wide territory opens you up to the screen and Bradshaw took advantage of them their first down at the oiler 16 ha not much of a trace of that toe injury that was supposed to slow lynn swann down two things here bradshaw has tremendous time to throw the ball you just can't give Terry Bradshaw that kind of time or he'll do this to you as a flying Swan puts it right on the money throws it low so there's no chance of an interception and that's a patented Swan reception what it's row did you see that tight spiral Franchot dart to Swan on the right side by Corson and Peterson a lot of concern here because of injuries which have taken down a number of the good offensive linemen that have been playing regularly for Pittsburgh but they show their great depth here as they go in behind a couple of reserve lineman for sidin Peterson and of course Sidney Thornton himself were reserved for many years carrying the ball in for a touchdown Matt Barr to kick out of Craig hole question in the first quarter thorns oneyard run gives Pittsburgh the early lane exactly eight minutes left first quarter Pittsburgh has a seven nothing lead against Houston Oilers deep to return Ronnie Coleman just activated this week and Guido merkins on the far side bad bars kick little deeper this at the 7:15 tackled by Randy Grossman number 84 playing on the special teams the Steelers a 49yard drive five penalties two of those against Pittsburgh and six plays actually there were four offside penalties against Houston and one was refused Dan Pastorini unable to move his club in the first two possessions that book in I'd you like to have those on either side of your offensive line the Oilers have it at the 14 yard line yes Pittsburgh Steelers laid both their defensive tackles inside usually it looks like a stun in there I think the the offensive line for Houston expected a stun Joe green just slips inside gets away it looks like Vanna sak who actually leaped out stripped the ball away from Pastorini and that's a very good responsible foul mock the center to get on that football and save it for you and these three points when you fall on those bubbles in the fourth quarter last week at Washington recovered one of Redskins and one of their own that saved the victory out of the backfield Tim Wilson and Wilson recovers his own fumble as he said by Lauren caves number 51 linebacker from California Lauren saves very active an alert linebacker you see him here locked up with Barbour that tied in but quickly read the screen came up is in position right there Coleman trying to get away tapes gets him by the arm strips it go out say he's lucky to get on that football either scores the wigglin hits again 14 a nothing on a drove into Stanley 37 yards short Bernie Jones heart Earl Campbell with a finery as they go outofbounds yes and the Oilers maintain possession they fumbled on all three plays of this series as a recovering very day the championship game here when a record 12 fumbles were dropped on this turf and of course that was a disastrous day for the Houston Oilers they're going to get back on this sideline and try and regroup a little bit alright bump Phillips must the feel at this point there's something to those Terrible Towels Tim Smith parsley two yards into his own endzone dying and it goes so Pittsburgh the second straight time after a punt that they put it in play on the Houston half of the field six minutes 13 seconds left in the first quarter Steelers with the ball and delayed now Todd pickups go beyond tough they're ramped up the biggest maximum payloads more than Ford or Chevy the most brutal our with its most fuelefficient v8 and with optional threespeed automatic the best mileage ratings to more than for a Chevy now one higher mileage question preparation is number one in gasoline mileage of the big three now Chrysler offers a four hundred dollar rebate make your best deal on these dad's cars trucks and vans and Chrysler will send you off four hundred dollar check get a Dodge diplomat get a check get a st. Regis get a check get a Magnum get an aspen get a Dodge van or a full sized pickup and get a four hundred dollar check check it out it died the Steelers scored on their last possession of 49 yard drive and they open at the oiler 43 after a short 30 yard punt by cliff parsley six minutes remaining in the first quarter here at Three Rivers Stadium Franco Harris inside the Houston 40 art Springer 53 from Ball State first man to make contact for the Oilers stringers been a fine addition to this linebacking crew which is one of the best balanced line backing crews in the NFL he's given them more range and better pass coverage ability out of that position Steve Kiner played there for many years played very well but they feel a stringer has the ability to to work right alongside Robert Brazil who's been a consistent allpro second down a long six for Bradshaw why action and this time it's the Steelers who are able to move and uncover their own mistake as 52 Mike Webster the center alertly fell on the loose ball they're not penalties they're fumbles what a wild start there's a wild start and that was blitzing linebacker Brazil who actually came in over the top and whacked that ball away from Bradshaw Bradshaw had done a beautiful job of hiding the ball but they had the Blitz on and they were able to get the penetration and knock it out just as he raised it to start to throw the winningest Steeler coach ever Chuck Noll he won his 100th game that counts postseason games last Monday night in New England for the orders and 14 recho deep of lynn swann a tough catch for a normal receiver but when swan goes in the area usually expect him to come down with a football and he comes up limping just a bit Swan running into double coverage here watch him as he goes down the field you'll get a look at it right there number 32 Vernon Perry stays to the inside knowing he helps his help out there gets outside you'll see a second oiler coming in but it's really Perry as he stays with Swan and knocks the ball away that's Wilson coming into the picture right at the end Vernon berry from Jackson State where he was a teammate world of Haven and Robert Brazil Colquitt hangs it up fair catch Ledo merkins what a Berlin Olsen's favorite names Guiteau Perkins at the 14 for Houston how merkins is a character has played wide receiver defensive back and now is listed as a backup quarterback I asked him in the locker room I said how do you know which which meeting to go to he said I can go to any one I want I know what they're doing in there he said interesting story a free agent pic and he made the club because Gerald Wilson scouting for Houston played softball with him in the summer said hey this kids pretty good athlete why don't you take a look at it now he's got an NFL uniform bastard a looking for his first first down the hall to Jack the Steelers we get by an allpro and ham and here comes another guy Lambert daniil you gamble showing client speed getting to the outside but one thing you'll see at the end of this replay is about eight or nine Steelers out there where the action is hamstrings it out forces Campbell behind the line and really makes the play he gives the defense time to come to the outside there's nowhere to go Donny Schell up and that's Lambert coming in to stick it away Campbell now poor rushes has only five yards second and 12 Pastorini reverse the cable he's got some Running Room 1015 outside at the 20 and out of bounds near a first down at the 23 so past greenie gave it the pass look and Campbell with a couple of fall steps to the right then circled back end of a Statue of Liberty type Lloyd variation off the Statue play you get a look at it right there as Campbell had started to his right reversed and came around and now watch some of the aloof elusiveness of this big back cuts inside gets away from one man they're a nice block on him and then breaks outside uses his speed and power to get the extra yardage he's just short of the first down as the Oilers look for their first of the game Campbell and Wilson third and one behind pastor rainy gamble first out of the 27 Marilyn you almost get the feeling that the Oilers love that situation short yardage and giving it to Campbell because if he can pop through that initial defense he's the kind of guy that can turn a short gainer into a 80 yard score one of the dangers always in stacking the line of scrimmage and taking the gaps as you do on short yardage is that you leave yourself vulnerable if as you say it's the receiver earthy ball carrier can pop through that initial yardage especially with a ball carrier like Campbell you don't want to get him isolated on your defensive backs and linebackers he'd just run over them first down at the 27 7 nothing Pittsburgh two minutes left in the first quarter gamble again or is he hit by John Vanna sak number 76 and Robin Cole 56 other scores first report from Buffalo three nothing bills on Tom Dempsey short 18 yard field goal and the Redskins have taken the lead at Detroit Joe Theismann to Ricky Thompson a nine yard score 73 Washington leaves Steelers burying their defense a little bit for this game knowing that Campbell must be stopped and they've stacked their people inside pretty well for an S able to take advantage of his position to make that last stop on Campbell second and ten kill green takes care of Pastorini the art bro from North Texas State still gets his share of sex well of course the man I think responsible for that play more than anybody you see Beasley coming off he's broken his mass was steep Furness who broke quickly inside got away from Heyman and I think came on hung on to him I think that's where the flag came from watching yourself watch furnace whoops here he comes inside of Conway Heyman you see Heyman trying to hold him out of there he gets by Mach now watch Joe green slide on to the other side and get a clean shot right there at Pastorini but I think the flag went down on Conway hema there's another one of those games at defensive line place and let's follow that as one of our themes today Merlin Olsen will first get the word from the official holding number 70 decline even where the hold Heyman couldn't stop Furness from ruining the play the fact that those four defensive linemen really had their own creativity and I know you were a part of that and helped to originate that system when you were with Iran the defensive linemen loved his stunt gives him freedom and gives him a chance to use some on those offensive linemen for Pastorini a ghost lon to Burrell his fingertips smell blood on the coverage one of the better man for man cornerback salut a headed London borough would have been playing against each other for about 13 years four years in college and nine years in the pro and I asked burl about blood he said yeah he knows me better than my wife and he proved it there as he was right on top of burrow for that past room right off the fingertips is Pastorini trying to hit the long bounce right a furrow Parsley's last two kicks have met been good jim smith pitch dance at the Steeler fortyfour Smith at the 40 and he's on that bye good coverage Ted Thompson 51 finally made the tackle he's one of the top special teams players for the Oilers a 41yard punt three yard return for the Steelers 7 nothing the Steelers lead bum Phillips Oilers second half we have some fun this is it off the 46 yard line again up in that three Andy Doris 69 off the pile and Greg Bingham 54 on the tackle at New England the Jets have connected on a pat leahy 30yard field goal 14 to 3 New England 1st quarter memories of that game we did last year up at New England when they blew out the Jets but then the Jets came back to play their best football there's the defensive front for the Steelers take a breather eris again near midfield short of the first down and odorous again down at the bottom of the pile for the Oilers and Greg Bingham motioning in as if somebody may have been injured we get Larry Brown number 79 who's been nursing an injury has not played and will not play today except in short yardage that's Steve Corson more they can ill afford to lose another offensive lineman as he goes back limping to the huddle does not want to come out of there but he's going to have to as he cannot do his job you made a good point Merlin that Larry Brown was a player that the Steelers did not want to use today he's already in there and now they have to use Tom Dorn Brooke of Kentucky so they're down to their last healthy lineman the rookie from Kentucky anthos for the first down we may have a measurement at first quarter dominated by the Steeler offense and New Orleans now with another field goal at Green Bay early in the second quarter leading the Packers six to nothing not only dama Houston comes away with negative yardage 15 yards rushing a minus 21 of course that's the sex coming into play there and Pittsburgh with 23 yards rushing in 34 in passing the comfortable 57 yards in the first quarter Chuck Noll not going to gamble at midfield since in the cutting team both quit to kick it to Guiteau merkins and bill courier the end zone and is in the end zone Dwayne Woodruff 49 very honest 30 downfield to try to cover it will be the Oilers ball at the 20 yard line early in the second quarter here in Pittsburgh learners with the ball trailing Pittsburgh 7 nothing hey wait those X's mark the different time that Saturday for sports world at 3 o'clock Eastern Time 12 noon on the west coast because we have one o'clock baseball both Major League Baseball contests from the west coast Cincinnati and Los Angeles Houston and San Francisco master any of the others at their own 20yard line lay action fake gets her old camel but an incomplete pass Johnson with eyes on the scoreboard has to bring it back Jack Lambert one of the premier linebackers in the NFL you'll get a chance to watch him in action as he backs up from his middle line backing position reads the play comes quickly forward Campbell looked to me as if he had control of that ball and Lambert is having trouble getting his hands on it watching as he crawls after it ah frustrating moments Lambert either that looked like a new swim stroke we might see that in the next competition that's fun to tease him about second in ten open down the middle Johnson Billy white shoes Johnson first down at the what a throw by Pastorini nothing wrong with his arm on that one reception by white shoes there we ask bum Phillips if he was trying to used white shoes Johnson as a kick returner he said I can't he's too valuable to me as has a past receiver I only have two healthy receivers right now and you see how healthy he is as he gets up beautifully and pulls that nice pass in from Pastorini and that's the first big play for Houston offensive the other day early in the second quarter Tommy creamer scrambling two yards to give Vikings seven nothing lead at Chicago picks it off zone 46 yard line obviously Jack Lambert he likes it when he doesn't have to swim the 50 if he only takes one stroke he can come up with a ball that's very frustrating I think one of the most frustrating moments there is for a quarterback who has fired it into the arms of a receiver and then watches it bounce away to be intercepted and it'll be credited as an interception watch the pass here right on target to Barber bounces into the air and alertly Jack Lambert is Sarah Lambert watch him as he drops in to pass coverage here is over quickly around the football and that's what makes him such announcement Jack Lambert second interception of this young season Pittsburgh leading seven nothing and Bradshaw typically going to go right to the air Randy first down at the Euler 40 yard the ever dependable tight end Grossman from temple what hands Bradshaw knows that the two wide receivers are going to be double covered frequently that opens up tremendous territory inside you see him scrambling for some extra time here picks out Randy Grossman Grossman is in the open having picked his spot in the seam there they take him down but that's a big game whore for the Pittsburgh Steelers in the first down Bengals have scored on a pete johnson run to take a 73 lead at buffalo in washington now leads detroit 10 3 Mosley with a field goal for the Redskins on the second quarter he took quite a pop dick I think one of the things that sets Stallworth aside as you see him accepting some of the pain that goes with that looks like he grabbed his wrist and we said he had wrist problems he has such incredible concentration this is the kind of pass that receivers hate to catch they're coming into traffic right there he refused to take his eye off that football took the shot went to the ground look on the inside as Bradshaw drops find this finds his man puts it on the money but look at the shot right there from 32 Vernon Perry who really will hit you first down Steelers at the oiler 21 leading seven nothing in the first half here in Pittsburgh Franco Harris fine high 52 Robert Brazil as they backed up Andy Doris Doris on Brazil collaborating to draw Paris in the backfield just gave him no options couldn't cut back inside and couldn't get wide New York Jets fall behind 21 to 3 in the second quarter Steve Grogan has three touchdown passes all long ones to Jackson for 49 Morgan for 437 he's hit Morgan again for 50 we're going to give you those scores as they rise our NBC vote will keep you uptodate on all the other NFL action might be too much time for the Steelers umpire with deep sleep a still time dorsen bradshaw little bump there that neither man seemed to want Chuck Noll must be very happy I think one of the offensive linemen looked at his hand on that Chuck Noll a very happy coach on the near sideline but I think bum Phillips has to be extremely upset on the far sideline he told me earlier that he felt that his team was at the same point that they reached perhaps at midseason last year and that he was feeling very good about the progress they'd made up to this point in the game they have not looked good it made it great many errors they've not played with the kind of intensity that I'm sure he wants to see on the field and offside JC Wilson with a free hand Wilson from the University of Pittsburgh born in Cleveland playing in Houston he was born to be a Central Division player I wonder if there was a bumping going on certainly there was some contact there but the defensive man is entitled to some territory and if the contact is incidental to both men being in the same position at the same time it's not a penalty on the defensive man just good position by the defender and of course every receiver I know will scream in a case like that hoping to get a call wilson nicknamed squeaky a moment he was in a tight spot there was Swann broke up the play there was no offside they didn't call it on 71 Bernard apparently he got back in time Grossman had not turned soon he was covered by Alexander the past seemed to hit him right in the left knee retro under quite a bit of pressure on that one is the Houston defense has been employing a poor man rush as opposed to the three man of course they play the threeman line regularly but they feel that they're getting more pressure now and they finally have some young defensive linemen that they can put into the game fact coach bump Phillips is very proud of the young man he brought in the last couple years feels that he has six good defensive linemen now Matt Barr this could be out of his range 45 yards they said anything was a bonus from bar and he routes went up 45 yards and the Steelers take up ten to nothing lead Barr's beers route they replace Chiarello's gorillas and it's 10 nothing Pittsburgh early in the second quarter don't worry they just got lucky I'm sorry I let us down forget it we'll beat him next week no I really let us down come on I'm gonna make a love light huh Michelob makes a light there sure the good taste of Michelob light don't just compare it to other light beers compare it to your regular it's that good and now her mother's out for year old rookie he looks more like 13 when you see about a uniform at least made his faithful happy where the 45yard field goal 10 nothing Pittsburgh the thickest Ronnie Coleman at the 5 15:20 had a little daylight for a moment and sagres after the point line were sacked Valentine 54 rookie linebacker for the Steelers makes this tackle we've gone from the gorilla to the bear here at Three Rivers Stadium rather passive looking animal let's and like the way this game has been going I think faster any thinks he's facing a group of bears out there they've really been tough to work against pressure is on right now on Houston's offense they've got to get something going got to get some points on the board minutes remaining in the first half pastor Aeneas 3 of 7 for 19 yards gives it to Campbell gets to the 30 maybe the 3165 Jean Tom Beasley from Virginia Tech replacing the injured Elsie Greenwood with a tackle and it appears on those first downs Merlin that that defensive line they're not playing any Sun they just try to physical you just play your area and stop Campbell they're zeroing in on 34 would appear that they're playing the run very strongly too they haven't missed they'll seem like you think they might but that's because of the depth and quality of the backups on this Pittsburgh team let's it off to Wilson and Wilson gets six yards through the 36 yard line before Lauren caves can make the stop and you could see those black shirts all looking at Campbell and when he dumped the ball off to his other running back Wilson there's a little daylight other scores the New York Giants leading 14 I think I've seen the Cardinals score early in the second quarter Theotis Brown a short run 147 Giants and at Chicago Bob Thomas's field goal for the bears 34 yards puts them on the board Vikings lead 7 3 midway through the second quarter Barbara Rucker and caster in for Houston and it's Campbell doesn't make what a play by 65 Tom Beasley that's what Merlin told you about at the start of our telecast the depth of the Steelers so outstanding they don't even miss an allpro like LC Greenwood now Beasley excited to be in the game and thrilled to death to make that play got a lot of help by watching the cornerback number 29 Ron Johnson came up so hard borsch Campbell to go outside and let Beasley oneonone on Campbell and had him going toward the sideline was able to take him down the Oilers have to give up the ball again parsley get get to a trio of Steelers Smith the deep man at the 27th beautiful spiral yeah all the way to the 13 25 goes the wide receiver from University of Michigan 49 yard kick 12 yard return the Steelers have a ball again 8 minutes remaining in this first half at Pittsburgh Steelers lead 10 to nothing or the pennant races are really something National League Pittsburgh leads Montreal by only 1 and next week you'll see Cincinnati at Los Angeles the Reds now lead Houston by a half game and the Astros will be at San Francisco check that time now for a game and the Astros will be at San Francisco check that time now 4 o'clock Eastern Time next Saturday whereas will have the playoffs for you American and National League early in October football and right back to Thornton he recovers at the 26 yard line that's the fifth fumble of this game all five recovered by the fumbling team unusual to see that happen usually you drop the ball that many times one of those opposite colored shirts he's going to jump on the ball Thorton coming out of the game apparently didn't quite get that into a dress before he tried to run away with it the bills a buffalo have taken the lead against Cincinnati 10 to 7 Terry Miller a 2 yard rug replaces 36 yard line Robert Brazil is one of the fine linebackers in football but even the play of a Brazil cannot nullify that beautiful run by Franco Harris watch Brazil as he gets a read gets out of the block right there number 20 Rocky Bleier comes down to help on the tackle but already Franco has the big gain in the first down Mike Reinfeld 37 also in on the stop as you look at Willie Alexander with Coach bum Phillips on the Houston side of the field Pittsburgh leads 10 nothing 643 left first half Kosta Harris hard swinger 53 good name for a linebacker because often he has to spring out those wide sweeps and that's just exactly what our did it made a good textbook tackle that's what Coach Miles said about that young man said he has great range and able to get out there and you saw it right there as Phillips would say we pause briefly for station identification this is the NBC television network sellout crowd on a beautiful football day in Pittsburgh the Steelers lead Houston ten nothing was 605 remaining in the first half the camper with Arlen Olson it is second down and ten for the Steelers at their own 37 yard line liar that's his first carry of this new season Rocky Bleier sorely missed for his blocking also can come in and get the big run for you knowing that they're going to key Harris he gets some good blocking some trapping on the inside Cole blocking well Webster and Blair accelerates rapidly but ends up going the other way with some fine work in the defensive backfield not till he got close to that first down maybe third and just over a yard to go officially just an eightyard gain for blyer who's out Thornton is in us short to that submarining moo by Thornton he's only five 11 to 30 and when he at the line there wasn't much to tackle except helmet and shoulder pads looked like he was running in the form of Earl Campbell on that one one of the advantages of a runner built like Campbell or like Norton Mike Robert Newhouse tremendous thigh size and very low center of gravity and when they bunch down and put those shoulders in that headgear at you you just can't grab onto anything looks like trying to tackle a bowling ball and Thornton got the first down for Bradshaw and the Steelers at the oiler or check that Pittsburgh's 47 yard line throw the flyer in 45 a what a job by Bradshaw as he had to throw out of the hold of Robert Brazil I was in on him in a hurry he didn't have much time the kind of play that shows the maturity of a Terry Bradshaw able to read that blitz and didn't panic at all just simply drop that football off blyer you see Brazil coming he's just scorching in on top of Bradshaw but still able to get it out and a good job of liar realizing the Blitz was on he turned very quickly to accept that pass a flyer and Thornton shuttling in and out of that backfield for the Steelers and each contributing it's now second and a long one at the oiler 44 Franco Harris maybe a yard at best let's check on other action in the National Football League the Cardinals down 40 nothing in the first quarter has scored twice in the second period mark Arneson has just returned the fumble 30 yards to tie the game with the Giants at 14 elsewhere the Redskins now move in front 17 to 3 at Detroit as Benny Malone is scored on a 5yard run and at Green Bay New Orleans 12 the Packers nothing Archie Manning hits Henry child's 33 yard touchdown score missed extra point of a key here it's 10 nothing Pittsburgh side again era straight ahead or Thorton it is again the defensive line of Houston reacting to that audible count and the defensive linemen are trained to watch the football watch what happens when they use their ears instead of their eyes they end up going offsides and I'll tell you Terry Bradshaw has really taken advantage of that Stensrud the young rookie right there listening to the count instead of watching that football Webster alertly snapping the ball when they saw him over the line of scrimmage first up who was most effective of that disc rhythmic table though Munson when you must've got us 11 times when we played Detroit one year I think he got Deacon Jones nine times in that game Louie he went to sleep at night hearing that wrong Papa still hear that barking camp Bradshaw great babe intercepted by art stringer but he was down on contact from Stallworth so stringer took it right out of Star Wars myths and Houston stops the Pittsburgh Drive that's the first interception this year thrown by Bradshaw and it took a fine play by the backer swinger though the owners have the football 252 remaining in the first half they trailed by 10 Charles Leavitt hands just got a Dodge Aspen and interception at each of his first two years with the Oilers has his first of 79 you can see why the Oilers like this young man he gets back very quickly has excellent range and great concentration on the ball able to strip it right there but that's a that's a defensive play what the Oilers need right now is some big offensive play and they just haven't gotten it here early in the ball game they have only one first down in this first half ask for any looking for Johnson and all they can see a black shirts bernessa Banaszak smothering very difficult to throw the ball when you have to throw the ball I think the Steelers were a little bit ahead of Pastorini anticipating that he might go to the playaction pass getting great penetration watch yourselves Steve for an s60 for Joe Greene both driving hard inside and it's for an S that's all over Pastorini bana Zack coming into the right side very difficult to throw when you're on your back I was straight ahead power this time they're liable to have a stunt Kaster veteran from Jackson State who led the Oilers last year with five touchdown catches one of the things that is terribly obvious to us is that Campbell is not having a very productive day and that really hurts Pastorini he's been used to having Campbell averaged four or five in fact over five yards at Carey early in the year right now Campbell is nine carries for 23 yards and that's not the kind of productivity they're used to conrad rucker 87 joins the oiler huddle he's the big 260 pound tight end Rob carpenter 26 in the backfield as Campbell is out we've got two tight ends right now after any dumps it off the carpenter the line is swimming 59 makes the play for the Steelers and they loved the defense in Pittsburgh Pittsburgh Steelers playing excellent defense on this crowd is just going crazy now two minutes remaining in the first half Pittsburgh with a 10 nothing lead and they're going to get the ball again four minutes left in the first half the Steelers will attend nothing late it's been a quiet Sunday afternoon thus far for Earl Campbell marsley to Ken Smith and midfield for the Steelers great kick he really hit one all the way to the 20 at the 38yard officials can and not apply the official couldn't find his flag through his gap at the 28 and you have to feel that say either a block below the waist or a clip against the Steelers East 7 yard kick and a beauty by parsley it looked like dirt Winston actually got two blocks there I don't know whether they call it on him but there was some good to hitting going on on the part of the Steelers one of the dangers of kicking the ball that well as you sometimes out kick your coverage and you get yourself in trouble parsley really bump that thing out of there Pat Haggerty we have a personal foul cutting we're gonna have all the scores for you on NFL 779 at halftime as you see the clip again well duck in one right here New England has taken a 28 32 lead over the Jets in the second quarter you saw the block the double block by Winston but I didn't pick out the clipping perhaps you saw it at home all at the 14 for the Steelers see how safely they play it 147 11 in the half Bradshaw hard to go to the air the biggest tight end in the NFL in terms of height six five and 247 good target but pass a little Ryan bit surprised aren't you Merlin to see Rancho throw from that deep in his own end with just a 10 nothing lead not really Bradshaw has gotten so confident in his passing game dick that he's not afraid to throw anywhere on the field and really the Steelers have gone from a team that that's number one weapon was Franco Harris to a team that's number one weapon is the arm of number 12 Terry Bradshaw stop the clock with 142 left the author's trying to tend the Steelers in playaction screen now Sydney Thornton is a bit of an enigma for the Steelers in that one day you'll catch everything inside and the other days can't catch himself and he's dropped a couple today and that hurts the Steeler cause and at the same time for the Oilers those two incomplete passes save oiler timeouts and stop the clock 137 left in this first half tenth nothing Pittsburgh and they bring in a fifth defensive back and a fourth defensive lineman to try and put some additional pressure they'd love to get a big break defensively maybe an interception something to get them a hoppin offensively maybe put some points on the board Bradshaw gets out of the trap good shot if you wonder why Terry Bradshaw the MVP last year and both the Super Bowl and the NFL watch him here it looks like a sure sack gets out of their grasp of one pulls away from stems root and still concentrating downfield picks out the receiver fires the completion just a tremendous play and the only the only reason he can make that play two reasons first because his mobile and second because he never lost his concentration watch Swan here breaking down the field season season Bradshaw is in trouble and breaks open down the field then comes back to the football Mike Reinfeld there to put him on the ground but that's a great great play terrific coverage guys and some of the folks watching down in Texas might have wondered whether Swan didn't push off on JC Wilson number 33 as he had lived his pattern upfield he did use a little push but at that point I think he was using that just to change his momentum and the ball have not been thrown as yet let's look at it again again you're watching Swan and Wilson on top of him here Swan turns in now that's where the ball originally would have been thrown Swan gets a little bump right there but that really has little to do with the play as Bradshaw is scrambling for his life upfield it was the second reaction this one that was the great one I want to play here he saw the combination of Bradshaw and Swan that has electrified the fans and certainly tough combination to beat in this NFL knocked down by Robert Brazil playing to his allpro status in this first half 1:19 left in the half stay with us at halftime we'll have all the scores the highlights Brad Gumbel Mike Adamle from New York in this second week of the NFL year here in Pittsburgh the highlights thornton scoring on a oneyard run capping a 49 yard drive to give the steelers a 7 done thing late mat bars 45yard field goal making attend nothing and for the Oilers you have to search a while to find any offensive highlights Pittsburgh's defense much to toe I think the highlight of this first half is that they have played that poorly and they're only 10 points down Bradshaw lookin for swine I believe Swan on my health a flood would have caught that when he seemed to slow up a bit Bradshaw getting some pressure they're still able to throw that ball power play down into the end zone and Swan as you said had he not been limping a little bit usually manages to make that play he always seems to get open doesn't it always seems to find a way and and of course that doesn't do any good unless you've got protection so you can throw it and a quarterback that can deliver the ball this quarterback can deliver the ball even under pressure and you see the timing here as Swan drives into the end zone just off the fingertips and we get another look at Swan who drives those defensive backs for those big strides that he takes and he got behind 33 wilson and just missed for six and Bradshaw let him just the step too much if you have one great receiver on a team you can double cover him every play if you have two great receivers as you look at the statistics for Bradshaw which you're not nearly as impressive as when he's put on the board and the way he's played if you have two great receivers then you have a problem and if you have a tight end that can catch them all on top of that as Pittsburgh does you really got your problems cut out for you defensively well you do have to have empathy for that oiler defense say and anyone else that plays these dealers Cole quit driving it toward the sidelines and outofbounds David just inside the 20 and the Oilers will have a final shot with just under a minute remaining 59 seconds in this first half all the scores and highlights on NFL 79 so stay with us at halftime know England hitting the Jets big thus far now I lead 35 to 3 before half them New Orleans trying to surprise Green Bay at home well we'll Pastorini try to hit on something with a minute to go Pittsburgh well II did that our pastor he may be having trouble with his arm and we see the concern on the face of mom Phillips but the one thing I would say that Houston has going for them going into the locker room and this first half although they have really not done a thing offensive ly their defense has kept them within ten points in this ballgame and ten points is not a lot for a team like Houston that has an offensive running game and the ability to throw that ball and explode on you and the owners of the type of team they usually force a mistake or two as well it created a lot of fumbles for any second and ten at the 17 gets up Wilson Wilson and Pastorini Alba collided and barely the hand off Beasley makes another tackle in the backfield of the Oilers some days things just do not go right and you're looking at a man who's shaking his head right now Donte Pastorini Pastorini of course as we said earlier had suffered with arm problems earlier was not terribly pleased with his passing last week in fact he said gee I'm glad we got out of the game with a victory I didn't want to lose it for us but his offense today and then we can't we can't lay it all on Pastorini has there been a great many mistakes that have kept them from performing one of them you just saw as a near collision in the backfield Pastorini dropping back a little looks like a kind of a statue play and Wilson choosing to go inside instead of behind as he should on that play unable to get by cleanly and of course the play stopped for a loss I measure the confidence of the Steelers they call the timeout with 40 seconds left they figure they'll stop Euston get the ball back again permit now you're involved in a new NBC project on Saturday morning call timeout and I happen to see some of the pieces that you did and I think you're going to be featuring the very first week next Saturday and they've been a lot of fun everything they really have a chance to talk to the kids about some things that mean something to us as athletes will have some gymnastics some football some tractor a lot of different opportunities for the kids to get a little insight into some of the different sports that they can participate in and duck hunting the great magician also has some how does he do it hey I'm gonna watch them every Saturday morning on it 14 the only setback good protection this time open no he trapped the ball Mel Blount trapped it at the 36 it was intended for Richard caster but too tall for the 65 receiver and that's what was happening to Pastorini in their game against Washington overthrowing on a number of his passes got him into trouble then and has gotten him into trouble today as well 34 seconds left for Pittsburgh as parsley comes in Jim Smith who was not to a play today but has returned all the punts stands in Houston territory now you know what it feels like to be standing back there waiting for this snap and knowing that the Steelers are coming and you better believe they'll try and block this one fires Lee 1yard into his own endzone gets it away and hits a good one Smith all the way to his own 38 Camden and run out of bounds at the 37 yard line Guido merkins was the first man downfield or that's a kick under pressure by parsley parsley averaged over 45 yards a kick last week and he's done a great job this week got a wonder dick if maybe bum Phillips might consider putting Gifford Nielsen his backup quarterback into this game Pastorini seems to be not throwing the ball particularly well and although Pastorini is certainly the number one quarterback you may have to consider a change when your offense is sputtering as the euler offense is in this first half did you hear Phillips line about the kicker parsley he said with time parsley will become sage I don't oh that's bad Bradshaw just out of the hands of Swan at the 40yard line and it took a fast move by Wilson 33 at a duck in at the last second and get a fingernail of Evelyn is that me or did that ball seem to hang up there a long time give you a chance to watch it at home Bradshaw back again the confidence he has in his passing game throws the ball out appeared to hang just long enough for Wilson to have a chance to come back they didn't have the usual zip on that one or that one might have been completed there's the receiver or the intended receiver swanny down and quickly outside has to hang in wait that's not usually the case that's a pattern that Bradshaw usually hits about the time the receiver is breaking 17 seconds left the other side of the field intercepted 40 and down at the 36 with five seconds remaining in this first half so Bradshaw intercepted for the second time Reinfeld has the second interception of this season Bradshaw putting a little move on auntie Doris that would have done the tough ride to the old scrambler targeted himself in fact he showed a little target going away from the line and then fires the ball again the ball seems to hang a little bit did not get a good step on it Mike Rhine field simply steps in front of it from a safety position streaks up the sideline but not a lot of time left on the scoreboard to get some points on the board here Houston will try probably one quick pass and then hope to go for a field goal wonder if we might see the tail end of that play again Greg Stemm Rick as you may have seen was covering the receiver with his back to the past some people think that is face guarding it is not the only way you get a penalty is if you're waving the hands now watch stem Erick 27 well you can't see him as the Bronco came up to make the interception it was the other angle where stammering covering the receiver had his back to the play as long as you're not waving your hands in front here it is that's not a penalty if he was waving his arms it would have been like he may have been using his hands such good a bit for a minute we had the field goal team out and now it looks like Pastorini is leading the three wide reciever team onto the meal as the field goal would have been from about 53 yards maybe even a little bit more I think a little bit out of the range of Tony fridge and you saw right next to Pastorini number 84 or white shoes Johnson you got to figure that Johnson's the man is going to try to work a way to get open deep in that Steelers secondary illogical play here or certainly to throw that ball up get a lot of people downfield hope for perhaps an interference call or a batted ball and certainly maybe a chance to get some points on the board from a field goal they're probably the last play of the first five seconds left they flood the right side up for grabs almost picked it off both teams were in the end zone Pastorini just misses and that's the end of the first half in Pittsburgh where the Steelers lead the Oilers Tampa typing at your Chrysler Plymouth dealers by the Schlitz malt liquor bowl the special premium brew that's in a class by itself by America's full service bankers ready to serve you where you see this symbol and by Radio Shack the nationwide Super Market of sound defending champion Pittsburgh Steelers laid the Houston Oilers ten to nothing as we approach the end of the intermission here at Three Rivers Stadium a sellout crowd 49,000 fans enjoying a steel tough Pittsburgh defense shellacking Houston in the first tab we'll be back after these words Houston Oilers and the Steelers are now taking the field at Three Rivers Stadium it's ten nothing Pittsburgh at the intermission Dick Enberg with Merlin Olsen and I imagine it was the most interesting session for both coaches during that half time I'd imagine that certainly the most busy of those coaches was bum Phillips trying to figure out what they're going to do in the second half but what do you think they'll do well I don't think they're going to abandon our game plan they need to go back and run the football do the things that they said they were going to do in the first half and didn't do Campbell is really the key to their game still if they can get him out in the second half and establish it a running game then that makes Pastor and he's passing especially the play a playaction pass is more effective I don't think they're going to panic just make down ten points if they were down 14 17 points maybe they go in to make some drastic changes I don't think they're going to do that at halftime Earl Campbell officially with only 23 yards rushing it is interesting to note that all last year only one back rush for more than 100 yards against that Pittsburgh defense and that was John cappelletti out in Los Angeles while Campbell had some good games he did not hit the 100 yard mark maybe even though that's what they do best that's running right into a Pittsburgh strength that you can't overcome a Pittsburgh effective over the years against the run because of the great line backing because of some find offensive line play but one thing we have to remember is that the Houston Oilers have made their mark in the last two years as a comefrombehind football team in fact in most of their victories they were behind at halftime they're no stranger to this situation and only being ten down there probably yawning a little bit better they've come back for a lot worse than that that old line know the oil errs got the Steelers right where they want them right 9 out of 11 times the last 11 victories for the Oilers nine of those came when they were behind at halftime good point Merlin we'll see if the Oilers have that charm going for them this afternoon next week on NBC sports world will be seen Saturday at a different time three o'clock so that we might be able to bring you the four o'clock major league baseball game of the week which will feature the Dodgers and Cincinnati and Los Angeles and the Astros of Houston will be a Candlestick Park to make the San Francisco Giants there's your lineup four o'clock Eastern Time one o'clock on the west coast so sports world at 3:00 Eastern Time at four o'clock at redhot Western Division pennant race of the National League now separated by only half game Cincinnati the lead after action yesterday all on NBC and stay with us after our action from Pittsburgh we have three games for you in the second half of the doubleheader here on NBC most of you will see the Chargers hosting the Oakland Raiders remember a year ago that game when the fame Pastorini on the sidelines I'm sure thinking seriously about what he's going to be trying to do and again i i'm sure dick that bum phillips simply said look we played a lousy first half offensively we did not execute well certainly we're going against a good defensive team but let's go out and take advantage of the things we do well let's see if if they can continue to play well defensively and get their offense on track Tony Frisch kicks it off and Larry Anderson at the 8 yard line for Pittsburgh Anderson with a good move and he shot through to the 34 yard line and acted as though he wanted more before 36 Carter Hartwig a rookie from the University of Southern California made the tackle Steelers take the field Terry Bradshaw with excellent completions twice denied by penalty and then couple of passes intercepted in the second quarter has with him in the backfield the running tandem of Franco Harris 32 in Sidney Thorton 38 Bradshaw not too happy with those statistics 33% of the first half franco across the 35 and into the hold of art stringer number 54 53 of the houston weathers stringer playing well in this ballgame absolutely living up to the expectations I'm sure of miles the defensive coach for the Houston Oilers an important series this first series defensively you certainly want to shut Pittsburgh down and you want to keep them from getting any momentum hopefully get that ball and decent field position to start your offense to work fake to Harris Brazil after Bradshaw whistle once clearly in the hold and control of the quarterback the whistle sounded and odorous secured the play after Brazil shooting in from linebacker made the initial hit the second sack for the Oilers as you can see certainly that kind of rule hurts the quarterback like Terry Bradshaw Bradshaw is so strong physically he often pulls out of the grasp of tacklers you see him get away from one tackler there and Doris using great hand strength able to keep a hold of it but you're absolutely right the play was called before he ever hit the ground because of the new rule ball just across the 25 yard line where it is third down and 19 for the Steelers they lead 10 nothing we're just opening the second half at Three Rivers Stadium on a perfect football day Bradshaw looking for stallworth he's open by Mike Reinfeld who had one of the two intersections for the owners in the first half little dismay on the face of Jojo Starbuck the bubbly wife and Terry Bradshaw's visiting with us here in our NBC booth as he pulls for her husband Brad shot back looks first to his right give Stallworth a chance to get open then fires the ball deep just a great defensive play by Mike Reinfeld who anticipated the pattern and broke quickly with the receiver got his hand on it knocked of the way white shoes Johnson is back to return this kick by Colquitt at the 35 a long line drive and Johnson at his 27 looking for help and then reverses running by Johnson but all back toward his own goal line Robin Pohl 56 Elden 48yard fine and a minus seven yards on the return will be back in Pittsburgh 40 minutes left in the third quarter we're pleased to be here at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh where the Houston Oilers endeavoring to generate some offense have the football for the first time in the second half trailing Pittsburgh 10 to nothing you see the Oilers running game all but nil in that first half Campbell for every yard again gets it out to battle 24 before mil blunt forty whoops comes up from the corner Robin Kohl six with a little extra push on Tim Wilson forty five Tim of course doing the blocking honors on that play the thing that we see happening the defense for the Steelers is forcing Campbell to run laterally and of course that's what you want to do to a big back you want to force him along the line and then you've got a chance to to tackle him when he doesn't have that momentum when he's coming straight at you you've got a tackling would force and it's very difficult on my back like Campbell six Johnson and Moshe Wilson up the middle and down at about the 27 yard line short of the first down by a couple Steve Furness from Rhode Island number 64 made the tackle yardage troops onto the field for the Oilers and it looks like we read their intentions pretty carefully dick they have come out and tried to establish the running early not going to panic ten points is not a big bulge for a team in the NFL but they did do one thing they put white shoes back to try and get the big play on the return and it backfired lawanda third and a long one caster emotion Campbell 1st down and a flag is down as Campbell has dropped at the 32 yard line and the Steelers are applauding so apparently against Houston now it looks like it's going to go against the allpro that he recently acquired from New England Leon gray as bana Zack stood up and applauded and said hey you can't hold on to me like that serious conversation on the sidelines Randy Grossman and of course Chuck Noll talking to Terry Bradshaw we have holding and we're sitting Eclipse puppets stare down the upgrades allpro tackle from Jackson State and the NFL world is still a bit puzzled Hallett boilers got him for a number one and a number six he's still puzzled I asked him about it he doesn't know why Wayne Woodruff gift the Pennsy back in for the Steelers on third down pastor a knee the Steelers had one of those stunts on vana Zach made the he hurt dick as he's on the turf very slow getting up what a tremendous rush these dealers have put on today Pastorini taking a little extra time and very sorry that he did as he just mowed under by that black shirt at rush I said at halftime the defense shall lack the Oilers I meant to say Shackleton but I believe Pastorini would agree with the initial comments along shellac again Vanna Zack coming inside as the tackle goes outside Furness and they've got three we used to call it a jailbreak that's a great turn again now all four get home free that's when a stun has really worked fast arena you can see the back he wears that back brace as well as the flak jacket on the ribs that's a carryover from late last year and then not a hundred percent obviously and now parsley asked to hit another long one and he's done a good job one in trouble Smith at the 41 abuse me by Carter and another good kick Smith drifting to his own 49 runs into his own blocker and he's down at the 45yard tackle made by car Berkeley Houston Jack Lambert can't wait to get back in there timeout at Pittsburgh 11 and a half minutes remaining in the third quarter defense takes its breather the offense on the field Terry Bradshaw the Steelers leading Houston 10 nothing Bradshaw is 6 of 19 intercepted in this one both sides playing outstanding defense rats oughta throw at the 34 how he gives he like an upstanding boxer anticipating the punch how he absorbs the blow he's always moving away from content hard to get a good shot at him and again the great communication unspoken communication between quarterback and receiver as chuan finds the opening and then Bradshaw delivers the football great spin there's Jojo Starbuck the famed wife of Terry Bradshaw the outstanding figure skater let's see how she liked this one oh yes Jojo introduced me to John Cole said I want you to be nice to him because he's very nice to my husband by the way you're going to be able to to see Jojo and some of our outstanding US Olympic prospects in a special star skate from the Los Angeles sports arena that's going to be the Saturday of Thanksgiving I know that's way off but it's a show that you'll not want to miss and Thanksgiving time think about us an NBC sports world and a special figure skating show second and five Pera sound the quick toss read well by the euler defense JC wilson getting over there in a hurry that's what we talked about early mom Phillips likes the aggressiveness of his two new men of the deep secondary Wilson and Brennan Perry Steelers have been attacking heavily up inside and on that particular play tried to get wide Harris not quite as quick as he was in his early days but getting out there and had it not been for the fine force of JC Wilson would have had some yardage farside a score Green Bay is connected on a Bharti Smith run of a yard 12 to 7 New Orleans leaves in the third quarter Baltimore jumps up early no four minutes left in the first quarter of Colts lead 17 nothing Gregg Hawthorne the number one draft pick in the lineup for the first time for Pittsburgh and he's the man there Hawthorne as he gets the first down physical specimen e6 two and a half 225 a first round pick out of Baylor they like it him to Calvin Hill no one on him gets up and breaks it down the sidelines against a little bit of extra yardage finally Ted Washington number 59 and art stringer 53 put him out of bounds but Terry able to get the ball to him quickly and apparently anticipated that coverage very easily the Bears have moved and run after falling behind 7 nothing Bay answered points they laid in a 30 Bradshaw going to throw for he has scored both touchdowns against the Patriots he scored both Steeler touchdowns today against Houston when the running game is going you can fake the playaction frees the linebackers give yourself a little extra time and Thornton in this case breaking open down the middle found some extra room fine passed by Bradshaw good catch six points they'll go for settled Matt bars try for point Blitzen and with a timeout and exactly 10 minutes remaining in the third quarter the Steelers have built their lane Pittsburgh 17 Houston nothing it's a Cranshaw just a minute 38 seconds to get seven more five plays 45 yards he hits Thornton 16 yards same play that was successful against the Patriots Monday Matt bars kick is short taken by the up back Tim Wilson at the 18 the 20 and Wilson from the University of Maryland gets it to the 30 maybe the 31 yard line kickoffs really are a function of kickoff coverage they're a function of hang time and acceleration by the onrushing defenders and although bar does not kick that ball deep hangs it very very high gives people time to get downfield and he won't have that many returned they are loose and for this for them this is good field position at the 31 faster any battered quarterback but the veteran from Santa Clara still in there both wide receivers to the left Burrell and Johnson Johnson in the slot bake the camel inside under pressure again tried to hit Campbell but the black jerseys were closer to the ball Cole and Lambert playaction passing really not very effective when a defense knows that you have to throw the ball and now with with 17 points on the board a lot of pressure on the offense for Houston I'm not so sure that that was a wise call under those conditions now Chuck Knox's buffaloes are back in front in the third quarter 17 to 10 Rowland hooks scoring on a three yard run Buffalo lead Cincinnati for their first way the same faster any down the middle intercepted by Wagner 35 30 the Steelers the ball at this that Fisher finally stopped him and for Wagner his 27th career interception these Pittsburgh Steelers are the only team to win three Super Bowls it's because of plays like this tremendous pressure on Pastorini has to unload before he gets deck there by Joe Greene what their reads the play beautifully steps right in front of the receiver and then breaks hard down the sidelines Mel Blount chugging doubleo as it comes off the line and right there that's just pictureperfect defensive play by Mike went back to live action Bradshaw throwing first down for stallworth and almost intercepted good coverage by Greg Stemm Erick oneonone against John stores in the end zone stop work talking down there to the officials also pumping going on but a an equal contest of bumping both offensive and defensively Gretchen loading the ball has time to get it off watching the corner of your screen right there both offensive and defensive and fighting for position stem Erick got the best position Stallworth acting as a defender then trying to strip the ball here it is again and stem Erick Justin I had the interception in the end zone so the Steeler still alive second intent at their own 28 yard line let's on and Harris right through that blitz to the 25yard line Nena three it's third and seven for Pittsburgh Steelers leading 17 to nothing we have nine minutes 15 seconds left in the third quarter and his Franco Harris goes back to the huddle Maryland a good time perhaps to point out once again how unique this Pittsburgh football team is 45 players not one of them has played it down with another NFL team I think one of the things that makes that special is that Chuck Noll and his staff can ask things of this team offensively and defensively that other coaches might be afraid to ask who are they going to compare things with say they don't do it this way Washington or st. Louis or San Diego they just don't know there wasn't anyone near that Bradshaw passes he unloaded it but did not draw a flag as 54 Greg Bingham had a bead on Bradshaw we'll see about the field goal kicking bar goes onto the field now Colquitt they've got Colquitt out there rather than our they're going to punt and drogon has hit another touchdown pass he has five today and that is very much like the game we had last year in New England when they smothered the Jets and just came back to have their own taste of victory but it's all New England again today a 42 yarder by bar is no good just missed to the left Joe bar who connected out a 45 yard attempt in the first half denied on that long try we saw Colquitt out there and thought for a second it was a punt of Colquitt of course is the holder for bar on the field goal team did a good job of getting that down a bar had plenty of range on that one just for a second let's talk about the the unique nature of this Pittsburgh team one of the other things that makes them special is the kind of talent that they have on the apprentice system that they use here bring young men in and they don't get a chance to play for a while they have to earn the right to get in there and once they do they'll get some playing time and that's certainly proved very valuable as they've had people go down to injuries here this game a store any on first down trailing 17 nothing almost intercepted by jack ham the omnipresent linebacker who leads all active NFL linebackers with 26 interceptions a flag is down it's like a holding penalty on the offensive line and that's what happens when you have to buy some time for a quarterback and meanwhile oh he has such great temperament and yesterday he was the last one to leave the stadium looking at films of the Oilers quite a student of the game holding number 16 at Fisher tagged with a call he's trying to work headtohead with Joe Greene not an enviable assignment even though he's aged a bit the joke could still get after you pretty good master any and the whole again inside his 15yard line going long for with white shoes Johnson that no blunt had him boxed in along the sidelines later today NBC presents the second half of our doubleheader Oakland at San Diego Miami Dolphins still the only team that has gone throughout this entire young 79 season preseason and regular season without a loss hosting the Seahawks of Seattle the Browns are their dramatic overtime win at New York they kind of Kansas City team and the Chiefs threw a big 0 at Baltimore last week and they've been working on the defense out there in Kansas City and we'll see how the Browns are able cheese that's all following this action from Pittsburgh on ABC second in 24 Pastorini in trouble can't get him is deflected it and John Boehner Zach from Eastern Michigan a free agent and 75 has one of those glorious moments for a line dreams about his opportunity to snag that football on that particular occasion Pastorini has not yet gotten up from the field as he was tagged pretty good on that play vanna's act alertly around the ball you see bum phillips is concerned for his quarterback obviously not just worried about what is happening in this game but certainly terribly concerned about the man who had led them into the playoffs last year Dan Pastorini I guess he threw that ball James got a piece of the hand and arm Gifford Nielsen the backup quarterback the young man from BYU now warming up and at this point you have injury or not you almost feel that Pastorini who is hardly nimble with all his various injuries might be coming out for a change to Nilsson we pause briefly for station identification this is the NBC television network this is channel 11 WI CTV Pittsburgh let's see if we can discern what happened to Pastorini is he had that ball deflected by Lauren caves and intercepted by Banias ACK Steelers Bradshaw out on the field commiserating with Pastorini and his teammates and they all have great respect for an outstanding athlete and no one in this game relishes this situation where they see a fallen foe watch Pastorini as he scrambles away from Joe Greene Dave's running stride for stride with him faster any offbalance here as he steps back tries to unload that football tabes going for the football catches him as his shoulder rolls away looks like he may possibly have done something to his shoulder what a terrible position to put yourself in with your body rolling one way and your arm going the other let's hope that there's not a serious problem with with pass during his throwing arm well that's an unusual picture in the middle of a game a man is injured and Mike barber and Terry Bradshaw going over the hitters while we have a second that we gave you a good look at Leon gray earlier and talked about the trade the shocking trade that brought him to Houston from from New England had a chance to ask him this morning if he had any inkling that that was going to happen of course that's one of the facts of life the professional athletes have to deal with that they can be traded on or the decision of a general manager and owner he said no he said in fact we talked about the highs and lows of the game he said I'd gone I'd left training camp and gone home my wife had gone into labor and we had a baby born to us at 6:30 in the morning and he said I called the coach Ron Earhart just on top of the world and said coach I got great news for you we just had our baby and things are going well and the coach said I've got news for you too and told him at that point that he'd been traded to the Houston Oilers and he said it took a while to soak in but it still doesn't know why but that's putting them right together then that's really riding the emotional elevator but in the penthouse right down to the basement the Pastorini applause from the people across the way indicating that certainly is conscious but obviously in considerable pain and they're going to card fast Rainey back into the clubhouse he has so many injuries in a way he's holding that side would either be the shoulder or the ribs ribs and obviously is true for this day and hopefully let's hope that it's not a serious problem I'm sure that they're not taking any chances and we'll try and get you some news on his condition as soon as they can they say as is his right shoulder and as you as you got a chance to look at it here watch him now as he rotates away to deliver the ball and then turns his body back on the delivery but can't bring the arm back because it's pinned right there as tames goes after the ball his shoulder follows through but Rush's of Bro has scored from nine yards out or the number one pick from Baylor off his own left side I'm very excited about the potential of this young man and he gives you no reason to challenge that as he goes easily into the end zone excellent blocking looked like he was going halfspeed and just trotted right in for the six more and the emotional letdown of the Oilers after seeing their quarterback go off the field and the Steelers immediately punch in the touchdown tack on the extra point and we have a timeout at 8 minutes and 12 seconds remaining in the third quarter Three Rivers Stadium where the Steelers have opened a 24 nothing lead what's up there Betts Burghley choose to 24 nothing midway through the third quarter Three Rivers Stadium bar to kick it off to Coleman and Perkins of the Houston Oilers 20 down at the 34 yard line first down Houston and a quarterback for the Oilers different Nielsen st. Louis only buying 14 nothing early the Cardinals now taking the lead in the third quarter 21 14 and Buffalo gets a touchdown lucious Sanford's interception return of 23 yards and they now lead Cincinnati 24 to 10 and the Redskins that was important lead Detroit third period 24th to be the number today is 24 nothing here in Pittsburghers Road made the tackle flag Assam tremendously aggressive play by the Pittsburgh defense dick while we have a second many of you at home saw they apparently relaxed and unconcerned attitude of the players as Brett as Pastorini was laying on the field that's a little bit deceptive one of the things that professional football players must do is to keep themselves emotionally involved in the game when one of their comrades goes down on the field the instinct of the player is to go over and blend all your support and all your concern but at the same time you've got to separate that from the game can't do that you're gonna be in trouble that's what you saw they they were hurting with him they could not allow themselves to get involved gamble has had a rough day that's his 12th rush and he now has 31 yards unofficially Steve Furness made the stop for Pittsburgh and it's now third down and about six another score from Green Bay New Orleans had the lead 12 nothing and now it's all Green Bay 2112 Steve Acton says just scored for the Packers ball davar leads Tampa Bay 17 to 6 before the half Richard Nielsen at the control third down and six incomplete at all trickle back to Mike Wagner was intended for Mike as a fancier the defense of the Steelers once again go back and underline what you've just talked about Merlin about the attitude of players basically what you're saying is there's obvious concerns on both sides for any injured player but to labor on that emotionally is just not part of the game you have to have something that blocks it all off and says hey it doesn't happen to me it does happen in the game and I got to go ahead and and play the best I can pump up our zli either stay on the ball again with a 24 to nothing lead I would say that parsley has had about he only plays the Oilers can be proud of they certainly a disastrous day for them although even in their pressure they've they have still played well defensively except for that quick letdown after the injury to pasture any coming up later today Oakland at San Diego shootout in San Diego Seattle of Miami she'll of course got his troops going well Kansas City that's the second half of our doubleheader here on NBC Bradshaw doris calls him down at the 18yard moon Doris now the Oilers logs the third Houston sack of the afternoon he's from New Mexico State worse in New Orleans where he once played with the Saints he works from the police department there did a little handcuff job on Bradshaw on the sidelines bulked himself up about 15 pounds heavier than he was last year playing some excellent football there's another I just thought of another reason why Barbara and Brancheau might have been attracted to one another they do have a common denominator they both went to Louisiana Tech's and they might have been checking out things down at the Alma mammy pretty good football institution Franco Harris to the 20 yard gain in fact Barbara was telling me you think of this as a ncdoublea division tutti Merlin was Mike barber their wide receivers will rock their car and Pat Tilly and Roland Harper was in the backfield and they had Fred being at the defensive lineman that's a pretty good football team right there you put a few chemistry majors in there and win the championship that's not a bad combination to draw to big numbers on some mighty big backs white white was not played today Joe green down the middle Harris but short of the first down at the 29 yard line tripped up by Willie Alexander fifth defensive back for the Oilers Bradshaw trying to cross up the oiler defense an obvious passing situation goes to the draw play to Franco Harris good call Harris pops open but good reaction also by the secondary as they come back up and get a hook on him before he can pick up the first down Colquitt will have to kick it away and they put white shoes Johnson hoping for the big play hoping for the big return Johnson will take it at is 31 the Steelers just continue to do everything well they just the complete game play of the Steelers is awesome and they're playing an excellent football club yep amazing next Saturday on sports world three o'clock eastern time to be followed by major league baseball we have from Irving Texas though the Cowboys it'll be bowling present great and the past greats of that time game followed by a world record high dive attempt Doug Jones I don't know how it is that they said it just a crazy height that he's going to try to hit I just get on that low board going feet first and my kids applaud it'll be next Saturday on sports were Redskins find a tighter at Detroit where the Lions have scored Rick keen on a 13 yard run for Detroit they have 13 minutes left in the fourth quarter each team looking forward its initial win of this new season both wide receivers to the left for Gifford Nilson roll Campbell nothing inside Steelers Furness and Kol teamed up on the tackle again the thing you'd like to do to a big back you want to turn him sideways you can force him to run toward the sideline he loses his power and you saw it right there as Cole was able to tackle him gonna be third and short and obviously the Houston Oilers if they're going to get anything going have got to get some points on the board they got to make things happen playing catchup football is is not a pleasant thing to do Buffalo built its lead to two touchdowns Neilsen this fire is intended for Rob carpenter out at midfield check that at Mike barber was the intended target 86 Nielsen trying to thread that throw through Steeler arms and Pittsburgh will get the ball back I wonder if anyone has done a master logical forecast on the Oilers for today dick they must have some very bad stars going for them well things are tougher elsewhere the Jets have three the Patriots have 49 now Tom Owen is in at quarterback for New England after drug him through for five touchdowns and OH on his past 14 yards for a score of 49 debris was some question as to whether New England could bounce back after playing such an emotional game against the Steelers and losing last week they certainly proved that they can that's a good football team up in New England Tom Phillips has not enjoyed his last couple of trips here to Pittsburgh after he beat the Steelers their only home lost last year early in the year when Houston came to town and beat Pittsburgh 24 17 then they had that rough match in the Astrodome Pittsburgh winning 13 3 and then the disaster in the playoffs went for the AFC Championship the Pittsburgh Steelers seemed to enjoy the icy home field and one going away 34 to 5 they're xraying pastor meanies shoulder and arm you see what what damage was done on that interception we'll try and get word to you soon as we can find out what's happening it just adds additional worry to bum Phillip says he has observed there on the left one amazing thing about that man he's so open and so straightforward oh he can take a loss there are some coaches that can't handle a game like this bum Phillips is one that can maybe his personality may be best suited walk down they're gonna go for it fourth and one caster motion gamble right that's a tax on another star on that stealer defense Justin needed one they said the game's best back in 1978 the top rusher in the NFL up the middle as it looked like he made it well let's give him a chance unload in there he didn't look like he had it at first but I think he surged toward the end he's amazing he fell down last week and got up and made six seven yards so let's not write him off yet no Merlin I think you're right where they spot the ball is that where it appeared he went down he must have been able to do a little nosedive and squirm under that defense because the ball is spotted almost to midfield and I think he does have the first down yes well that's a calculated risk certainly again talking about playing catchup football you just you have to do some things you don't want to do you turn over the ball at midfield you give him another shot at you but when you're down this far you have no choice what what testimony to the Pittsburgh defense only the third first down of the game for Houston the first of the second half and had to go to fourth down to get it and Athiya Nielsen the barber broken up neatly by Michaels Waggener and they seem to be in good spirits about one another despite all we've read and heard about the rematch and revenge and all in fact before the game today they came out it was one of the nice things to see they talk to each other they shook hands and even video Mike Wagner walks away shaking his head and blabber got a little smile there a very close call at all it could have gone either way you can see it for yourself Gifford Nielson back delivers the ball hi Wagner has good position watch him now and see if the contact is early Wagner going up for the ball pretty close it looked like a good defensive whoa what a hit I'm Tim Wilson who tried the middle and gained one let's just write down all the scores for in New England in the fourth quarter leading the Jets 49 to 3 st. Louis 21 Giants 14 third quarter bears 19 Minnesota 7 in the third quarter Buffalo lead Cincinnati 3117 in the final period Washington over Detroit 24 17 in the fourth quarter Green Bay leading New Orleans 1412 our last report Baltimore 17 6 Tampa Bay in the second quarter the Green Bay score in the third quarter they got the date on all the stores here 24 nothing Pittsburgh Nielsen a bullet complete to Billy Johnson is spirited at the 28 yard line well that Johnson something every time that Billy Johnson has touched the football in his NFL career he has gained an average of 16 point 1 yards now that's a big money player it's no wonder that bum Phillips wants to get the ball to him as often as possible see Billy stopping off over there to talk to an official about probably some bumping going on down the field Gifford Nielsen doing a good job delivering that ball does not have the power of a pastor Bradshaw but is a very apropos third and and the figures to be Campbell it is able to cut back inside the wide defensive coverage close to the first down many people feel that Jack ham is probably the premier outside linebacker we have had a chance to look at the other linebacker who has gotten a lot of respect around the league Robin Cole watch him right here he goes outside gets in front of Conway Heyman number 70 steps back in gets a little piece of Earl Campbell but Campbell picking a solo well has got them into a fourth in one situation for all at the 27 yard line Marc leads his team out of the huddle captain ol Steelers have shut out the Oilers as far as coming before nothing two minutes left in the third quarter whistle that's no play they whistled a dead before the snap quite possibly too much time yes well the new quarterback in there Nielsen and may have extended that 30second allowance between plays it's been a day when nothing seems to go right for the Houston Oilers for time oh we got a false start there it is on the right side you see Fischer lifts his hand before the snap of course the automatic penalty of five yards still have to go for it down this far you have no choice and again play catch up football is dangerous business fourth and six for Nielsen but a flag is down and we may have a defensive hold against the Steelers Johnson actually on fourth down should have just batted that one down they would have gotten it at the line of scrimmage but I don't think it's right a count anyway the flag could be against the Steelers it appears to be that way as some of the Steeler DBS wandering back a little upset apparently by the call but that's a that's the kind of play you have to make if you're going to get some points on the board many people here will be unhappy with the call a good call by the official five yards on the defensive hold against Pittsburgh and the automatic first down so the Oilers and this has been helped by penalty their longest drive of the game less than two minutes left in the third quarter 24 to nothing Pittsburgh now they're trying to see whether it was defensive holding in other words a hold before the throw or interference now they bring you back the other way yes five yards for defensive golden matter when the ball was throwing and when the foul occurred had the ball been in the air same contact interference again the use of the double check rule each defensive Becker linebacker allowed only one hit on a receiver if they take it second hit on him an automatic fiveyard penalty and a first down ball at the 27 of the Steelers not caught a pass to the right barber ink is the left side of one robbed partner Jack Lambert along with Jack ham and Donnie shale three ol pros in that Steeler defense team up on carpenter who played his college ball at Miami of Ohio and with a name like carpenter give you three guesses to what his hobby is Merlin I don't know what happened er carpentry that's right very good and looking at that picture of Jack Lambert you can't help but wonder if maybe he had not a work go to dental school that Lambert other he and Neilson rented well and that's going to be a flag against the Steelers Billy Johnson the intended target and I think what Pittsburgh's complaining about there is once the ball hits the hand of the receiver then you can hit him let's see if there was contact before the ball arrived Donnie shale a very aggressive player proving the Oilers being helped here briefly by some calls and by some very aggressive play on the part of the Steelers I think they're the most physical team in fact without question the most physical team in football and that's one of the reasons for their great success we just got word from the locker room that the xrays were Pastorini and have indicated a jammed shoulder jammed arm but no breaks and certainly for Houston fans holding their breath and certainly for his teammates excellent Gifford Nielsen at the controls held by penalties on this drive gives to Campbell and he's down to about the 13 yard line let's repeat that News Dan Pastorini taken off the field on a stretcher in this third quarter has not no fractures second down a Gary Dunn yeah Gary Dunn the hero of last week's game with three sacks against New England and just looking across that defensive line none of the original Steel Curtain in there Dwight white sound there Joe green LC Greenwood Ernie Holmes of course long gone that was Beasley 65 done 67 made the play and that's the end of the third quarter at Three Rivers Stadium where the sellout crowd enjoying the home team advantage up to beat I can't compete we're still gets it it's got that guts the bounceback Uniroyal presents the Steeler radio lead the race for the 1980 or pocketed that address again just a moment to Ken Berg Merlin Olsen three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh the Steelers 24 Houston honors nothing Houston with its deepest penetration of this game third down and nine inside the Pittsburgh Neilsen under the Blitz and he can't hit can borough complains that Blount was holding him that's had longstanding matchup Blount and borough and Blount getting the better of things today as that allowed a catch by double zero can borough of the others there's the emotional leader of this Pittsburgh team and say he's a meanlooking man amazing to me dick you look down the lineup of that defensive team in there now and the whole front floor is switched over from the Steel Curtain that we knew they got Beasley and Dunn and benna's AK in there pronouncing their names that blew it off sides on the Oilers it looks like I think the real key to the successful domination of playoffs in the last few years by the Steelers have been several things they have quality players and incredible depth they certainly are able to generate outstanding coaching Chuck Noll a brilliant strategist has got a good coaching staff and they have a topnotch organization here they've been able to draft well and it would appear from the depth of this team that they're going to be safe for a long time to come five yards against the Oilers it's 4th down and 15 Nielsen trying to get on the board away from Beasley into the end zone intercepted Wagner has another Mike Wagner that'll be a touchback for Pittsburgh they'll take it out to the 20 longest drive of the game tonight as we open this fourth quarter Mike Wagner the heady free safety of this dealer has always around that ball and we have a timeout early in the fourth quarter in Pittsburgh where the Steelers he'll lead 24 to nothing now Mike Wagner excellent athlete at Western Illinois many great Olympic athletes and as you see Nielsen being picked off want to give you that Olympic address again u.s. Olympics post office box 1980 M Cathedral Station Boston mass oshu one one eight bumble and Bradshaw again on the loose ball it's been an incredible statistic today we've had six or seven fumbles all recovered by the fumbling team or old Campbell has certainly had many better days than this one I doubt if he's ever had a day and I don't think this would be a problem to check out I doubt if he's ever had a day this bad in the pros except for the game against the Houston in which he was hurt and had to leave in the first quarter for nothing Steelers second and 11 Pittsburgh behind Bradshaw for now it's Rocky Bleier into the game and he drives out to the 24 yard line before pushed back by the oiler defense wire from Notre Dame number five stealer richer all time Smith and Stallworth and now the wide receivers Lynn Swann given a breather but Bradshaw still in at quarterback I know Mike physic is a bit frustrated the backup quarterback for the Steelers was such an outstanding player in front of him and even in a game like this he doesn't get much action how about the number three quarterback cliffs tau Henare a number of years never had a single play in the regular season I mean if you want to be frustrated try that one that's for sure Bradshaw behind the antenna target Franco Harris a hard stringer the closest oiler now david stern's ted Nathanson our producer and director they've had cameras at all angles where they get this one really well they got this one tucked away behind the offense as you watch bradshaw drop back get a look at the pressure being applied by the defensive linemen excellent excellent coverage there it is right there Tom Lowen away Franco Harris had no chance stringer was upset he thought he had a chance Colquitt to Billy white shoes he makes just an excellent catch then stays inbounds 2530 and wrestled at the 31 and Johnson getting his leg pinned in underneath his body and let's hope that he wasn't heard that was an awkward tackle as Johnson went down and he has not gotten up yet Oh 13 and a half minutes remaining in the game Pittsburgh leading 24 to nothing 34 white shoes Johnson injured on a fairly innocent tackled get an idea right there look like his legs were twisted as the tacklers and blockers alike rolled over the top of him he's still on the turf large number of players they're clustered around him several doctors and trainers and what a disastrous afternoon it has been for the Houston Oilers not only disastrous on the scoreboard but Pastorini carried off in a stretcher into the locker room and now white shoes Johnson obviously dragging that right leg as he heads off the field and not the kind of player you can afford to lose and still hope to be effective in your in your season and that that is not a good sign as he leaves the field what's that it's a tough emotional pill for the fans of the Oilers to swallow today as you see the other scores updates from around the country and it's rather obvious today we are consciously trying to keep you right on the spot all the other games in the National Football League you seen the scores almost as quickly as they put them on the scoreboards in a various NFL stadium here Bob Phillips looking for that first one to go up on his side as Pittsburgh leads 24 nothing in the casualty list is mounting for a Oh Phillips I believe that's the same me that Billy white shoes Johnson hurt last year and missed the almost the entire season so that might have been the look of almost ministration there comes the frustration of the Oilers after the tackle Oh Tim Wilson one of the owners appeared to be robbed carpenter went after a scalar defender and punch was thrown had heard that it was after Mike Wagner that carpenter was addressing his anger and he is out of the game will see whether or not any stealer is ejected and you quickly see the defensive coaches and bum Phillips and the rest of the team say hey cool it we don't need this little class out there but frustration is bound to bubble the Steelers came in here the Oilers excuse me came in here expecting to play good football and they have played tough against the Steelers perhaps tougher than any other team Rob carpenter coming in from the backside stacking up a little bit on top of play that's number 29 Ron Johnson wondered where that extra stuff came from Arthur Nielsen hits Renfro Oh don't see a flag down I thought there was a penalty when you hit a man in the helmet with any part of the arms or body and that was a high hip I'd like to see that one again I thought that was a penalty Renfro has not caught a pass in the preseason or till now is recuperating from knee injury takes this pass comfortably feels good about it and all of a sudden Justus ambushed right there that's dirt Winston and he just about did take his head right off got sandwiched at the same time by Lambert coming in underneath or not to burn Lambert but Cole number 56 ball exploded out of there Donnie shale 31 picking it up for the Steelers you now have the ball if that's not a penalty the officials are really asking for trouble Hawthorne bobbled the snap because the other side sees that and there's they able to be retaliation and this is the kind of game that it shows signs of flaring out of control let's see that hit again at full speed see it at full speed see what you think boom boom you don't go after the head that's one of the new rules they put in this year that to protect the man with the ball you tackle and you have to hit him in the body surface not in the header helmet you don't attack the man with a ball at the head very Bradshaw 20 for nothing despite a off day in terms of his accuracy oops almost picked off by Stan's road intended target it appeared that Wilson hit him before the ball around oh they're building up to a rematch already everything just like heating dynamite on the stove down there you watch Bradshaw he gets away here that's stendra knocking the ball loose Bradshaw picks it up and he is decked as he unloads that football but the lateness of the throw and the extra shot right there by Brazil there are a couple of possible Finley's not only the two hit over the top before the ball arrives but watch Brazil right here coming in from the backside boom ooh did that hit occur before the ball arrived from that angle that looked like it was pretty close it was against Wilson for interference at the 38 yard low Bradshaw the Hawthorne and the play was made defensively in such a manner that I believe Brazil shielded the view from Hawthorne number 27 the rookie he may have seen the ball as a clear the defensive linebacker here's a young man who spends most of his time without the headgear and wearing a communication set talking to the coaches upstairs relaying suggestions possibilities some plays out to Terry Bradshaw you know who Alan Clark is Merlin oh yeah Alan Clark did a great job of returning some slack and he discord for New England and will have a fifty six three lead oh boy coach Walt Michaels is probably wishing he'd stayed in bed today Hawthorne and thanks are heated to say the least 24 to nothing Pittsburgh leads the Oilers 1134 remaining might be some questions Merlin when you have a valuable property like Terry Bradshaw why you don't give a crew sick or a stout a chance to play with eleven and a half minutes left and things getting a little rough out there I'm sure that Cruz ik is thinking the same thing and maybe even Terry Bradshaw thinking the same thing but it's hard to secondguess the coach that has three Super Bowl trophies in his trophy case and has put a team like this on the field but you know if you'd ask Bradshaw he'd never like to come out though he loves to play the game at the 25yard line Lynn Swann makes the catch tackled by JC Wilson first down Pittsburgh you said that Bradshaw likes to play he especially likes to play when things are going well for his Steelers right now he's got it on track nice play as he flips it high to Swann and again the great athletic ability of that receiver is obvious as he goes up to pull a pass that that is a little bit high swanny doesn't worry about it he just goes up picks it up and in spite of the hit from the backside just brings it on down Swann leads the receivers so the Steelers with those four ball thrown in motion on first down Bradshaw that's one over the middle and down goes Swan I believe the law of progress to about the 14 yard line and Bradshaw took a good hit from Washington Washington right 59 from behind as he unloaded linebacker on the Blitz and certainly what can you do what can you do you get in you get the Blitz on him you try and put the pressure on him you see him right here watch watch Washington come to the right side of your picture you'll get clean come around from the backside but even then Bradshaw unloads gets it away pays a little bit for the toss but there's Lynn Swann coming back to the ball breaking beautifully it's going to be second very very short get short of the first down at the 14 of the Oilers this one had to come back to make the catch whoops blown signal to loss back to the 18 or 19 yard line Jesse Baker number 75 a rookie secondround pick from Jacksonville State he said my biggest problem is a pro with all those people watching the biggest college crowd was around seven thousand plus back in Florida can't help but wonder if possibly there wasn't a blown play as Bradshaw turned around and everybody else was going the other way fortynine thousand seven ninety two four nine seven nine to nethers Steelers sellout they've been treated with 24 nothing in the fourth quarter Bradshaw what a crooner Tim Smith for the touchdown perfect rainbow throw to Smith and the Steelers have 30 safety blitz see you see stomach come on or done stuffing you can see bradshaw come off the field we're watching white shoes Johnson going off that's the second on the stretcher of the day and at the same time Jack ham is walking to the Pittsburgh Clubhouse well what a scene ham an allpro linebacker with a groin injury he's going back to the Pittsburgh dressing room and Johnson the allpro kick returner to the Houston Clubhouse the kick is good by far and with eight minutes plus remaining in the game in Pittsburgh the Steelers now lead it 31 to nothing our NBC doubleheader the Chargers will be all of that as they're ready for the Oakland Raiders the Raiders with a great victory against the Rams last week in Los Angeles that'll be seen by most of the country ito merkins into the hold of Anthony Anderson the rookie from temple made this Pittsburgh team stopped at the 28 yard line I think bum Phillips might have been a little bit of a prophet when I talked to him last night I said is this a good time to play Pittsburgh he said there is no good time to play Pittsburgh of course we were referring to the fact that there there were a number of injuries and a number of Pittsburgh front liners would not play but they have just been awesome here today last week every game seemed to be so close 10 to the 14 games decided by a touchdown or less and it seems to be this the opposite this week in the NFL on a lopsided games Nielsen right into the arms of Winston winston's first NFL interception is a touchdown 36 to nothing third Winston many feel could be starting for most of the teams in the NFL of course here he backs up the Jake the great Jack Lambert and you see Gifford Neilson going off the field Ron Phillips there to talk to him watch Nielson he gets a pretty good shot right there from Beasley just as he unloads that football unable to get it high enough and of course carried it in for the touchdown add the extra point and boy and they bring in this fixer out you just hope that they don't have any more use for it today lead 38 to nothing with eight and a half minutes left rusik who rarely sees duty apparently going to come in the next possession by pittsburgh let me correct myself Dennis Winston did pick off two passes two years ago that was his third career interception of course his first touchdown Ronnie Coleman down to sidelines and pumped out of bounds at the Tushar the 30 and a little extra action over there as Anthony Anderson 33 comes out of a pile of Houston jerseys now these are football teams that have great respect for each other but they have been so competitive over the past years that their sparks flying when they get in groups and every time they come together you begin to wonder if they're gonna come out without a fight Guiteau merkins they're number 12 he's a feisty little devil where said I know whether he goes into a fight as a wide receiver or defensive back or a cord effect Steelers try to use as many of their reserves as possible we see that the rookie 4920 Woodruff now in the secondary for Pittsburgh the Andersons playing a corner number 30 that didn't look Philips bored little toss that was hesitant at best as boobie Clarke acquired from the Bengal sign waivers 245 pounder from Bethune Cookman out Phillips very pleased to have him on the club will be Clarke's first carry of the day Gaines very little at second and a short 10 B's Lehman caves made the tackle burro to the left Renfro to the right that might really help me Ronnie Coleman he's tackled at the line of scrimmage it'll be third and 10 Earl Campbell and bum Phillips trying to protect the franchise it appears that Campbell's going to be rested the final seven and a half minutes of this game 48 nothing Pittsburgh and oh how lonely it can become when you run into one of these and every National Football League player knows the feeling it happens to everybody I've been on the long end there some of those 50 someodd twonothing scores and there's only one way to deal with it you put it behind you and you forget about it and very often coaches don't even let you look at the film of the game like this is that's a part of history we just forget about it Nelson hits Conrad Rucker he got only 2 passes all of last year now he has three this year 260 pound target from Southern University thank Joe Costanza our statistician Bryan makinen Tim Fogarty player identification from Three Rivers Stadium and we're starting to get some finals in the National Football League it's the first of the day and you have to imagine that the Jets were glad to hear that final gun New England pounding them 56 to 3 here in Pittsburgh six and a half minutes left on the game Neilsen the booby Clark with a 46yard line Jon Faddis act made the first hit number 76 27:14 the Cardinals in the fourth quarter Minnesota down twenty six to seven and at the ending of Chicago gets a final now Cincinnati shut up last week and Buffalo 51 to 17 for the bills about Knox had a defensive team some crooked numbers on the board to dowel Ronnie Coleman yes 45 yard line of Pittsburgh I'd better explain that expression crooked members which is borrowed from baseball lexicon and manager left nothing more to look up and see on his side those eights and sevens and fives he said I'd like to see those crooked numbers of the board for my team and he says if the NFL bottle in that suit today lots of five ruzic ready to come in for Pittsburgh other action final Redskins so they hold off the Lions Lions Owen to Washington now even at 1 and 124 Washington time running out here in Pittsburgh Steelers very much in command 38 nothing big goal for Coleman and Dennis Winston he hits us hard as any back in the league Dendi Merlin he does Coleman doesn't do that in his own right Coleman recently active it in fact just activated for this game appears to be in pretty good shape that's Dennis Winston 53 coming in from the inside and both Winston and Coleman went right bang on the head of Lauren Hayes I think Dave's had beginning to wonder where he is what happened to me you get two guys banging that hard and then hitting him right in the helmet it has been a hard hitting game we talked about the frustration of the Houston Oilers but they just in one of those days when they couldn't do anything right and the Steelers had been hot in spite of the injuries that they had had and a number of people who have gone in and substitute physicians they have played nearperfect football in this game today any coach would be proud of the performance of his club of battle this pattern of the Steelers Rob carpenter looking for the first time yardage and he had the sticks out of bounds at about the 35 yard line we received word Merlin that Steve Furness has a bruised knee for the Steelers so the penalty of injury rising on both sides of the field we pause briefly for station identification this is the NBC television network in eight days we'll have some interesting news for Pittsburgh on channel 11 at him sellout crowd of over 49,000 have watched the Steelers build early 38 to nothing and you stay tuned we have the second half of a doubleheader on NBC coming up most of you will see the Raiders and the Chargers from San Diego are standing by out there in Southern California as well as in Kansas City and in Miami one by an old gentleman up high in the stance here enjoying the whole thing hard Rooney will good look at him later on we'll see mr. Rooney when we return to Three Rivers Stadium where his Steelers lead it dearly loved owner of the Steelers Art Rooney it's a measure of the man you look at the Pittsburgh Steeler press guy you don't see a picture of mr. Rooney coaches and players are featured he's a man who's always taken the shadows and let his players and coaches have the boughs and put them a long time to enjoy the victories that are now piling up fast for this Pittsburgh organization and you know yeah I think of mr. Rooney the way I think of Gene Autry the baseball owner the California Angels who by the way when we featured tonight at ten o'clock prime time here on NBC a man loved by just about everyone who's ever met him this I know that a lot of people claim that they did for Rooney for mr. Autry to get into a baseball playoff certainly one of the reasons for the great success here in Pittsburgh was the patience that he had and with Chuck Noll early in his career when things were not going well here in Pittsburgh but he should hey I believe we're on the right track and he stayed with him he was right Ruby Clark showing some speed as he pounced out of the 26 yard line of the Steelers and at this point with four minutes left in the game for the Oilers a chance at least to save a little face and get on the scoreboard they don't want to be shutout by Pittsburgh we just got word that Laurent Aves has jammed his neck will not return today and this is beginning to resemble what they called the hospital Bowl last year in the Astrodome when so many players from both of these teams went to the sidelines because of the very violent play yato merkins a backup third string quarterback is now the wide receiver to the left would Renfro Gamble has not played most of this fourth quarter Coleman just activated before this game adds a contract dispute at the start of the season join the club late did not play last week suited up today and he's seen plenty of duty tackled by Tom Beasley close to first and may have a measurement they're calling it a first down as they move the sticks down and I think both coaches feel the same way as this game grinds to a close they just want to get it over with and get it behind them Pittsburgh with not much left to prove on this day and certainly Houston with many wounds to like first down to Coleman didn't realize he had a first down and they lined up in a tight formation and went off tackle and got short yardage clock running down to 242 39 Steelers led at halftime tend to nothing we still had a game there but they scored twice in the third period and two more touchdowns in the fourth quarter taking advantage of just about every turnover and on this day there's superior effort they just have done so many things well it'll be a challenge what it does someone call the Steelers the Goliath a football of the present time everyone taken the slingshots out at it sometimes it takes a little more than that but playing the way they have today they're not going to sneak up on many people from the NFL of course they wouldn't anyway a Super Bowl champion like the Steelers carries a special responsibility in their games because everyone says hey if we beat them we have instant status two minutes left in this one we have a timeout the score Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh the Steelers 38 Houston nothing once too strong two minutes remaining bump Phillips Oilers down at the pittsburgh 21 yard line looking for their first score of the game they trailed 38 to nothing six yards passing for the Oilers Oh van Basten he started off with a shoulder injury Chuck Knowles defense Britt nickname toughest ear incomplete is Nielsen by the way Earl Campbell today 38 yards rushing 16th rise at 2 yard average that's his lowest NFL total for a game in his two brilliant years let's go down all the scores for you final New England 56 the Jets three final the Bears beat Minnesota twenty six to seven final Washington 27 Detroit 24 final Green Bay coming from behind they trailed 12 nothing at the half beat New Orleans 28:19 late in the fourth quarter Buffalo 51 Cincinnati 24 in the third period Baltimore 17 Tampa Bay 13 the other games just starting Oakland San Diego Dallas San Francisco Seattle Miami Cleveland Kansas City stay tuned we'll have the second half of our doubleheader right after the final gun they third down and three Clark so the 14 yard line appears to be just short of the first down he's 23 but he went a few Kewpie dolls of the carnival plays professional soccer before he arrives here at about 20 games professional soccer city said he had a mad Hungarian for coach that's his father his brother Chris of course the tape with the Bengals a great family from Penn State fourth and one Coleman right into the thick of that Steeler defense and a believe he has the first down Gary Dunn 67 first man to make the hit as the seconds tick away in this fourth quarter of a bruising game bruising the Igor the Oilers who trail 38 to nothing but much more seriously their core crippled by some key injuries primarily Pastorini and white shoes Johnson started off on the stretcher rather lineup for the second game of our doubleheader we'll go right to those games at the final minute here in Pittsburgh oh just inside the ten yard line as Neilson staying on the ground clock now 37 36 seconds no effort to stop that clock by the orders who are as close as they've been today to ask or executive producer of NBC football Don ohlmeyer telecast of today's game has been produced by David Stern directed by Ted Nathanson technical director was Bruce Burke West Mike Hadley was our associate producer and Randy wons Associate Director good job gentlemen Nielsen knocked away balanced I'm number 54 it was the second round pick out of East Carolina by the Steelers just 13 seconds left stay tuned the second half of the doubleheader coming up immediately there's your lineup just as a parting thought dick I'm sure that Noah Chuck Noll would like to take some of these points with him into the rest of the season maybe parcel out four or five a week and it's nice that Coach bum Phillips and his staff can put this game behind them and say hey we've got a new week new chance let's forget about this one Nielsen has a man open and Renfro ran out of room in the back line of the end zone with eight seconds left next week the Steelers will be at st. Louis and the Cardinals gave Dallas all they wanted last week and playing well again today and the Houston Oilers will host the Kansas City Chiefs who thus far have played very well so there's no Noah wasters it doesn't it doesn't get easy and of course people looking at this film certainly on the pittsburgh side will we'll have cause to wonder what in the world they're going to do against the defense and how they're going to last play for the Oilers fourth down eight seconds left Nielsen looking for six hits Americans for a touchdown that is his first NFL score like wide receiver the third string quarterback for Houston and with three seconds left Chuck Noll with a smile that's almost a nasty smile from the head coach of the Steelers I don't think that's a day after project I think that he is almost smiling and relief for bomb philipson for the Oilers he didn't want to have them shutout I he's a very nice gentleman he's not going to give you anything but to see the score by a guy who has such little notoriety as merkins it's strange irony that he would be the guy to score their six points fresh to try the point after and interestingly Merlin Joe Costanza vloging that drive the Oilers finally score in the final seconds and it took them 18 plays on that drive to punch it in and a toss from Nielsen who by the way these are his first ever NFL passes and of course in that or this year 2 for 4 last year but as first NFL touchdown Nielsen Guido merkins Tony Frisch there's one prized possession that the antiques he likes to sell or collect but those shoes they're five and a half years old he guards them with his very life he must feel as he did earlier in the year when he came out picked up his jersey and realized they'd misspelled his name and one of the preseason games it's been that kind of day I think there are a lot of players on the Houston side of the line who did we'd like to have somebody else's name on their backs today it's been that kind of day I would close out with an interesting note for you NFL fans Tony Frisch that is alltime alltime the best of kept secret in football he is the best percentage field goal kicker in the history of this game over 69% Frisch I watched him kick one day in practice and he said how you want it to go left right up you want me to hook it fact if he really has marvelous control of the football and although he doesn't look the role of the great athlete he does have tremendous ability and sidekick covered by Robin Pole of the Pittsburgh Steelers it had not gone the 10 yards but the team receiving can cover in that zone before 10:00 that's the end of the game Terry Bradshaw and the Pittsburgh Steelers are now to a know after a scare Monday night they come back to beat the Houston Oilers today 38 7 promotional fee has been paid wins the Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh Terry Bradshaw the Steelers winning convincingly 38 to 7 now state to and most of you will see the second half of her NFL doubleheader Cleveland Kansas City Seattle Miami Oakland San Diego after these messages from your local station",

stadium is going to be packed and there will be plenty of people out in the parking lot just having a good time we're gonna see two outstanding coaches tonight John Robinson of USC and Charlie Mac Charlie McClendon of LSU well Charlie Mac is who everybody calls Charlie McClendon Charlie Mac in Louisiana and all over the country and the coaching field for that matter a great experienced coach he's been in a lot of big games a lot of bowls John Robinson a great young coach been in a lot of big games inaudible games for a young one this game isn't going to bother either coach the name Williams should be very prominent in this intersectional clash tonight Kevin Williams number 8 for USC and Chris Williams number 22 a defensive back for LSU look down here they say Chris Williams can cover anybody Kevin Williams in Los Angeles says he can beat anybody well if they throw the ball to him it McDonnell gets time to throw it's going to be interesting to just watch that contest the folks down here have been talking about upset for over a week what do you think they live a I think the Trojans have the best football team on when you just look at it straight physical personnel and I think that's the way it will come out LSU USC the kickoff coming right up by two dudes with all that food familiar I want to take you to the committee parents gasps dogs with licinia see what is it meatloaf sandwich in our life gentleman we all know and appreciate White has 1/3 less colors with regular beer and it's less filling but the best thing is it tastes great a spelling no you're wrong this is my brother you want the beach you gonna like beer familiar everything you always wanted in a beer unless California your chevy dealers have a message for those of you who haven't bought a

tankful than these smaller foreign cars more room and comfort got stop meeting like this and more miles per tank Chevy Malibu the temperature 81 degrees relative humidity 62% a big roar go up from this partisan LSU crowd as we prepare for USC LSU here in Baton Rouge hello again everybody Mike Walden along with Dave Levy the Tigers of LSU have won the toss they will receive Rob curb prepares to kickoff Chris Williams his deep for LSU and it'll be Williams five yards back in the end zone eel makes no attempt to run it off and we're underway with for the Tigers it'll be a first down at there Davida Woodley will be at quarterback June being a fullback okay the tailback the flanker Jerry Murphy the split in Carlos Carson and the Robert daily LSU with the 200 records they crushed Colorado 40 pulled it nothing at Rice forty seven to three USC number one in the polls threeandoh after defeats over Texas Tech Oregon State and Minnesota there is the first play in the game as Whitley heads off the air by John up for the 25 yard mic LSU went without a tie when in motion they snapped the ball when he got into position to be an extra back in the backfield they ran us seas blast play right up the middle with to lead blockers Ricky gray makes the taco a gain of five four guys on second and five Woodley for LSU tigereye its guy shot again to the outside by Jean three push down last show I'm not sure if USC's inside line back here's where stunning to the strong side formation or not but they were definitely over shifted guys John a guy with a great name as well breaks it to the out backhoe may buy Jeff Fisher with some help first intent for LSU at the Tiger 33 yard line Tiger Stadium 76,000 plus and this plane Nets about three yards guy John the carrier a gain of about three a lot of the proteins had some action in their chip banks led the way and dave levy this is one of the rare times SC gameplaying in home uniforms cardinal and gold it's been quite a while Mike I think the last time was 1973 down at Georgia Tech in Atlanta what LSU is trying to do in their running game so far is get a power i formation without lining up in one getting to lead backs through on us sees linebacker on the inside and trying to get a doubleteam on the nose guard is a very good Olsen so far it's been good Wow 15yard penalty against LSU holding against the Tigers that's the referee Joe Hicks he's from the South East Conference we have a split true here tonight three officials from the southeast three from the plaque Ted Joe Hicks is from Birmingham Alabama he's the referee the umpire from the pack Ted Neal Gharib the head linesman his nor Ackerman from the Southeast Conference wide sale is the line judge from the pac10 will give the others in just a moment this is guy Sean again somebody had a hold of his shirt and that somebody was tie Sperling the nose guard of SC us si is shifting its defense completely over to the strong side innocent weak side tackle LSU is seeing that automatic back to the weak side guys Jean having some success going outside but it's pretty long yardage to try that play it'll be second down and 20 yards to go for the first down the bottles at the LSU 20yard line no score we have played just two minutes of the first quarter that's the tight end coming in motion Lafleur throwing on the run is Woodley incomplete he was throwing to Jude Hernandez his fullback Ronnie Lott covering Woodley is the type of quarterback that is that likes to run option plays he's very capable of doing a very good job on normal bootlegs and sprint out passes and Oregon State had some success although not scoring much but with that type of play so LSU likes it anyway I think we can expect to see more of it this program is authorized under television rights granted by the University of Southern California and it is solely for the entertainment of our audience any publication reproduction is strictly prohibited the handoff the guys on nail at the 25yard line getting up off the bottom of the pile for us see Dennis Johnson well we expect to get 20 yards on a draw play on an obvious fast draw screen down it's a pretty ambitious task it just didn't happen LSU partially stopped themselves I think they showed some pretty good ideas on their running game in punt formation is John Adams he's been averaging almost 43 yards of punt the snappers John Ed Bradley deep man is ray Butler look at that excellent spiral Butler update 25 Butler is snowed under by a Stanton made the tackle you can tell from the reaction of this crowd that L way I don't think we're gonna find a quick fired up this is going to be a hard hitting contest all night it was a 45yard punt by John Adams and now the Trojans will have their hands on the ball for the first time tonight first and 10 at the Southern California 32 yard line Marcus Allen and Charles white as his running backs rock shot he comes in motion it's Charles white Charles white bumped down hard at the 34 yard line LSU normally uses the same defense that USC does but you can look for number 40 LSU strong safety he's playing up like a linebacker and they've moved their normal outside linebacker not over the tight end but maybe a yard or so wide so they're trying to play a type of an eightman front which means they're probably in the mantoman fast defense that's the offense he picks that up a gain of just two by Charles white second and eight at the 34 no score we've played four minutes so far first quarter Mike Walden and Dave levy Marcus Allen Marcus Allen fumbles I believe Allen reached out with his right hand and recovered it for USC he was hit lost the ball as he was going down and then was able to gather it in at the 39 yard line a gain of five on the play setting up a third and three for Southern California this is a good this is a good LSU defensive team strongest part of it is the secondary even there one new corner back tonight a fellow they call themselves the soul Patrol they can play mantoman third and three for the Trojans with Hunter now Williams goes in motion he's not in your screen right now McDonald wants to throw McDonald spinner on 40 and McDonald is spilled at the 45 yard line and that is the mark of an experienced quarterback he couldn't spot anybody open so he decided okay if they're going to give me five yards I'll take it and McDonald gained six and he's got a first down for Southern California you can see the PO McDonald was looking to one side of the formation only obviously the men were covered he took off running right away and went straight up the field exactly what he should do and he got the first down tackle it was made by Jerry Hill first and ten at the 45 of Southern California Allen and white the running backs Rock Shawnee goes in motion Charles white 45 15 play it is in to LSU territory and white stopped it around the 45 or 46 yard line by Marcus Quinn the strong safety and credit Don most far Roy Foster and Chris hook with some good blocks up front as long she continues to play as you see the replay Charlie White takes it outside almost the minute he gets the ball uses his speed gets a pretty good block from Butler for a while and picks up a first down I believe were mighty close to it but as long as LSU is going to leave number 40 they're strong saftey almost up even with the linebackers USC is going to have to go to the weak side for at best up the middle on the running game and a landmark for Charles white he now has an even four thousand yards in his career he's now number nine in the alltime NCAA stats list as a rusher he just passed Joe Washington of Oklahoma it will be a first down there was some discussion whether it was or not and the coaches made it by inches so it will be a first down at the LSU 45 yard line ray Butler wide to the right side and even out farther from that is Williams who now comes back in motion to give us to Marcus Allen stopped at the line of scrimmage there's just not going to be much room on the strong side on the side of the tight end LSU is determined that their quarterbacks are it are good enough to play mantoman pass defense with us these receivers that remains to be seen in fact the passing game really remains to be seen Greg Bowser a freshman nose guard had made the stop on Allen no games second and 10 at the LSU 45 Butler wide to the right side Williams his flank to the left side and motion comes white McDonald wants to throw he's got time he's going long and deep for Kevin Williams and it is bobbled around and intercepted in the end zone by Chris Williams well you can tell what LSU thinks about that last play the stadium really comes alive and as you're watching Kevin Williams running almost straight up the field he has his man beat for a while Paul McDonald throws the ball a little bit to the inside a little off target and the defender wins the jumping contest Kevin Williams is 58 Chris Williams who made the interception is an even six feet and that's his 13th career interception Tigers were the first up from their own 20 hokey guy John with a stutter step gets just one possibly two yards Dennis Johnson on the hit as I told you a split officiating Carew Joe Hicks is the referee Neal Gharib from the pac10 the umpire norm Ackerman as the head linesman he's from the SCC wide sail from the pac10 is the line judge al granting from the Southeast Conference the field judge and John Barger from the pac10 the back judge second down and eight the ball is at the LSU 22 yard line we're about midway through the first quarter no score here in Baton Rouge Woodley wants to throw he's looking for Carlos Carson in December by Jeff Fisher at the 35 yard line Jeff Fisher the junior from Taft High School in Woodland Hills making the intersection for Southern California the intended receiver was Carlos Carson the leading catcher for LSU and Fisher made a great interception at the 36 and got it back to the 33 of the Trojans are really in business for the first time to the LSU 33 after all these years I still like working out I really like is a beer that's waiting for me when it's over and if you work out the way we do there better be a lot of beer waiting with me that's all we drink Light beer Miller Lite has onethird less calories in regular beer and that's less filling and it tastes great take it my guy who works out a lot could really use one right now like beer familiar everything you always wanted in a beer unless satisfied customers by Chevrolet dealers than any other make in the USA Chevrolet is number one mile after mile year after year the California one you we want to see you Southern California Chevrolet dealers now so SC gain 22 yards on that exchange and the Trojans with a first down from the LSU 33 McDonald wants to throw to ray putler dishes it off to the tight end Hobie Brenner at the 25 and Brenner is dropped at the 24 yard line Hobie Brenner a junior from Fullerton who was the most valuable player in football and bass all that fullerton high school boy was he a great athlete coming off knee surgery a year ago last spring Hobie Grenier LSU taking some calculated risks in this first quarter overloading the strong side against the run playing mantoman the weak side running game is there and so would so in a weak side passing game be there McDonald to Brenner for nine yards at second and one for the Trojans at the LSU 24 McDonald wants to do it again it's complete at the 15yard line rame Cutler made the grab at the 15 Chris Williams was covering the right quarterback of LSU but he couldn't do much about that well Mike you've gun remember mantoman pass defense doesn't say stop everything it says don't get beat deep but really crowd really crowd the man as close as your ability will let you in this case Butler drove the cornerback over had time to catch the ball and I think the Trojans will continue to try that if that a gain of a first down for Southern California at the Louisiana State 16 rock shadi comes in motion Ellen White running backs penalty marker drop could be delay the game that's going to be it the lay of the game the Trojans now going with their three tight end offense if you will Rock Shawnee number 80 playing what John Robinson calls the VBAC or allpurpose man he's excellent at going in motion and then John Robinson likes to run student body rider left with Rock Shawnee leading the play it's the first time we will see if you see John Robinson on the sidelines the first time now for the Trojans with the ball back on the LSU the butler over Kris Williams covering but McDonald let him too much a lot of Bengal tigers on or near the line of scrimmage I would agree with what John Robinson is asking Paul McDonald to try to do and anytime people play mantoman pass defense that means they should bring at least one extra person on the pass rush you won't have as much time as usual but when it works it's going to be a big play three tight ends right now for Southern California Williams is out of there Rock Shawnee is back in second and 15 walk Shawnee in motion the pitch to Charles White makes his cut at the 20 down he goes at the 18 white necks only three the hip mate by the linebacker Jerry Hill everyone on the LSU defense knows who Charlie white is and when Paul McDonald pitches that ball out you're going to find a lot of people trying to get there I don't like the secondguess but it's kind of fun if if Charlie White would throw the halfback pass I think he would find somebody wide open because the minute he starts to get the ball wide everybody comes Dan Garcia goes wide to the left side in the slot on third and 12 is Williams McDonald dumps it off over to white at the 20 when it is hit at the 16 falls forward into 15 a gain of only three and the Trojans probably will have to go for a field goal the tackle was made by Ivan Phillips and here comes Eric hip hip missed his first two field goal attempts that was at the season's opener Texas back on the 8th of September so he's old for 2 and field goal attempts holding will be Jeff Fisher he will kick this one from the 22 yard line snapping will be Mike McDonald the Tigers jumping up and down trying to bother him the kick is up it's got the height it's gone 32yard field goal by every tip and the broken jaw this is the University of Southern California standing proudly on the threshold of its second century 100 years of academic excellence private support and responsible independent education a century of outstanding men and women leaders in the arts and the professions a tradition of commitment a catalyst not merely a reflection of the vital changes in its community this is the University of Southern California proud of its independence prepared for its future accepting the challenge of private higher education the University of Southern California moving toward century two LSU wasn't able to move the ball so we pick up the action with USC's next series of downs first intense Southern California at the Trojan 23 to nothing SC leads thanks to a 32yard field goal by Eric hip tailback Charles white 25 spins away picks up an additional yard Tommy Brazil number 44 the linebackers stopped white after the six yard pickup it appears to me that USC's interior offensive line are winning the contest on the line but with number 40 the strong safety up there there's a man you can't really account for so they've got SD sort of outnumbered as he's trying to counter with that by bringing Rock Shawnee in motion that time it was a good idea good game Dan Garcia is now in there for a butler for SC white gets the call again down he goes of the line of scrimmage the hit made by George attea the nose guard Charlie McClendon is a very experienced coach and he is going to try to take away the one make you beat him some other way it appears he has decided to make us see beat him in the air piste what he feels is an excellent secondary make it very tough to run and so far that's true white has carried seven times for 22 yards three to nothing SC we have 43 seconds remaining in the first period Rock Shani MacDonald deflected McDonnell got heavy pressure from John Adams the defensive end and Adams just got a piece of it I think he was throwing the Vic rocks on it this is exactly when you want to have this is the type of game when you want a good punter and a good defense that won't rat keep you in the football game ahead if possible until your offense can decide what it can do McDonald was conferring with quarterback coach Paul Hackett on the SC sidelines Dave Pryor who is averaging 41 point 1 yards per punt this season 8 kicks ready to punt for SC Kris Williams one of the deep men for LSU and it'll wind up being taken by Willie teal and he goes up to the 40 yard line Willie teal number 37 LSU with pretty good field position to start out we're they trying to move the football not a great deal of success I would expect them just to still try to put the football in the air I I think we'll see some more of the option series but most of their running game has not been consistent neither is the passing game that was a 36yard punt by Pryor in a fiveyard return by teo first and ten at SU at the tiger 40yard line georgia chicas now the nose guard for SC guy shot has run down by Ronnie Lott will be a loss of two yards on the play hookey guys on and again we have been talked so many times on these se telecasts about the speed of the linebackers Scoggins and Dennis Johnson and Ricky gray that Larry McGrew but grew maybe the fastest of the whole lot but this time it was Ronnie clock running down hokey guys on that play looked like it had a chance to go someplace and Ronnie allowed an excellent tackler and a great hitter miss made it a twoyard loss great a nothing SC 18 seconds to go first period that's Lafleur the tight end coming in motion Woodley or a girl's complete the Carson person slips one taco hooks another one and Carson has finally run down by Dennis step first down LSU sounds like New Year's the it was was a split receiver down and then with a great second effort he breaks a few tackles and the Tigers have great field position a lot of people around the ball but Woodley threw it right between everybody great second effort Dennis Smith finally just bear hugging and holding on for a ride and that's it for the first quarter from Baton Rouge USA leading three to nothing you've heard me talking about my stores Lee's bar stools and dinettes and now I'd like to talk about my advertising agency ad marketing they specialize in marketing techniques and media buys for retailers like me working with ad marketing has really been a pleasure I get

whether Woodley was hurt or not or maybe he was just taken out of the game Charlie Mac was displeased with his play anyway the ballcarrier guys on tackle made by ty Sperling and Larry McGrew a gain of just one Charlie McClendon may feel that Ensminger can just pass the football a little better than Whitley has so far in this first half it that maybe all of this there's hokey guys on number 47 on the sidelines we've got a new tale back now for LSU Jude Hernandez and here is Ensminger and complain Carlos Carson and I think the second I think Burt Ward number 23 did a good job he's entitled in his position see the receiver if we see the play again break to the outside and then turn upfield if Ward was in position the officials certainly made a good call but at had the receiver broken free that ball was on target the new tailback for just one play was Leroy Jones pokey guys on I think is going to be back in there let's check the backfield yep and Lionel Wallace is a split end in smegger down the middle it's complete 36 yard line of Tracy Porter Dennis Smith makes the taco and ends finger did a great job of wiping that ball down the middle Charley McClendon apparently was right in slinger doing a good job of throwing the ball in LSU not trying to keep this game close LSU really going after the wind Charlie McClendon feeling his defense doing a great job wants to open up and then really get this crowd behind his team a 13yard pickup Ensminger the Tracy Porter first down LSU at the SC 36 the Trojans leading 3 to nothing the canvas all the way down to the 12 yard line Russians were in a safety blitz on the strong side I believe that was a trap play it broke right up the middle and when you blitz Tremblay right up the middle a lot of people barely missing the tackle but it couldn't have been a better call against the defense that was called that was Jude Hernandez the fullback a sophomore from Baton Rouge a gain of 24 and now the Tigers are really in business were the first down at the Southern California 12 guy Shawn is the tailback the pitch two guys on at the 15 stopped at the 13 yard line it's going to be a loss of about a yard spilled if I heard before the left quarterback of the Trojans who really cutting down and guys John is limping off the field LSU continues to have problems with what what I would call their normal football plays they like to run out of the I formation their success has come from slightly unusual formations doubles triples if they go back to it and the new tailback now is going to be the Roy Jones don't running back as Hernandez in smegger cuts down once again LSU in an unusual formation what we call a triple 3 wide receivers to one side puts a lot of pressure on the past coverage when the quarterback gets time a perfect throw and this Tiger Stadium is up for grabs in swinger going down the middle watch it again you saw Ricky gray stick a hand up the ball was thrown a little bit deep a spread out pass as LSU is going for a twopoint play and it's no good I don't know if that was planned or not Michael but the kicker picked the ball up it didn't appear to be a bad snap I think he was trying to throw to Jude Hernandez in stinger throws 15 yards for the touchdown and it goes to Leroy Jones and LSU now leads six to three early in the second quarter I get the tip I got it I got the tip Furillo America is getting the tip smoking tiparillo and not inhaling it's a good tip want a nimble way to beat the high price of gas get a gas 10g frontwheel drive Datsun 310 hi Datsun violates to keep you

today there is one near you 79 season and for the first time this year the Trojans have been behind in a game LSU six to three over the Trojan Don Parcells will kick off for the Tigers it's high but it's not gonna go very far and couple of the Trojans bumped into one another at the 21 yard line like we just saw a play there that almost turned into a big one for LSU Doug McKenzie number 39 apparently didn't feel that Michael Hayes number 25 could get there and whether that's lack of communication or not you never know but McKenzie should have been the blocker and hey should have been able to it appeared that haze was limping a little bit as they went off after that collision with Mackenzie and John Robinson trying to be very calm about the whole thing right now 1234 to go on the second quarter LSU leading six to three first down for the Trojans at the 20yard line McDonald hands off to Marcus Allen gets a couple the taco made by the defensive end John Adam I think it's a very good idea for the Trojans to start trying their counter type or reverse type plays because LSU once again lined up very strong against the running game to the tight wrong side and the man if they get any movement and break the line of scrimmage that could be a big play it's second and eight SC at their own 20 to walk Shawnee moving out the pitch to white 25 white to the outside 30 doing a tightrope back into the sidelines down to the 37 or 38 yard line by Marcus Quinn from a sudden white just squirted out of that crowd the Trojan offensive lineman as you watch the play again are doing a good job of controlling the line of scrimmage it's the extra man that time two people went to the outside charlie cut back up inside the contained was just a little flaw in the defensive pattern a gain of 15 by white first down Southern California at the Trojan 37 LSU six to three 11:49 to play second quarter white now with 38 yards in 15 carries white again to the 50 45 out of bounds around the 40 yard line I'm sure Paul McDonald automatic to that play it appeared to me that LSU either was really taking a chance or did something new for the first time in this game and lined up to the strengths to the field rather than to the tight end Charlie our white pops clean and you can't afford to let him pump clean a 24yard rocked by Charles White Robert to run II ran him out of bounds first and ten now at the 39 yard line of LSU Michael Hayes is the tailback white is out of there but Donald McDonald to the 40 McDonald to the 35 Paul goes to the 30yard line and again McDonald getting a gain of about five or six yards when he didn't want to risk an interception and he fell all those receivers were covered John Robinson decided to run I mean the pass on first down rather than to run and to get into a formation that would force LSU out of their normal almost eightman truck when they think if they're running down everybody apparently was covered in Paul McDonald once the intelligent thing took off the brand of all white goes out Charles white back in at tailback so Michael Hayes is up and white is the tailback again on second and two at the 30yard line McDonald just picked up eight this is Alan penalty marker drop Allen goes to the 25yard line and on the last carry by Charles white he now is number eight on the NCAA rushing list alltime passing Charles Alexander of none other than LSU penalties can continuing to keep the Trojans in a little bit of I shouldn't say continuing it hasn't been much of a penalty game really but a heck of a drive going and now the long yardage situation it's going to be second and seven ah with a ball move back to the LSU 35 10:40 to play second quarter LSU six to three up fumble on us at the 35 he's being picked up by number 77 the big defensive tackle of the Tigers Vinci tip it all this LSU defenses is an experienced football team they're doing some calculated things and they're getting away with it so far USC apparently has solved some of their blocking problems on the inside and I think a strength contest is slowly being won by USA's offensive line right Butler wide to the right side in the slot to the right devin williams michael hayes moves over to the left side the long running back is down and in this world is supposed to crowd is causing McDonald to audible eyes or wait just a moment on his cycles my guide outta fits the crowd it may be what the defense is doing but I know one thing you don't want to be 3rd and 12 in Baton Rouge that's exactly what it is third and 12 at the LSU 40yard line we've got a new linebacker in there Albert Richardson replacing Tommy Frizzell for LSU third and 12 after 40 at the Tigers LSU on top six to three McDonald watched the throw to Garcia he dumps it off to Kobach Marcus Allen and Allen is nailed by John Adams right at the 35 yard line we were told LSU's defense played very well against the pass and in the first 20 minutes or so of this football game that has certainly been true so the pudding team on the field for John Robinson's USCG Brier we'll be back in punt formation and Pryor has done a good job this season kicking out of bounds inside the five let's see if the freshman from Hemet can do it again he did it twice against Texas Tech he did it against Minnesota last week he's aiming for the sideline boundaries and it'll go out of bounds around the 11 yard line the 11 or 12 a market at the throw the tiger 12 and listen to this crowd LSU wasn't able to move the ball so we pick up the action with USC's next series of downs first and ten for Southern California at the 34 McDonald has Marcus Allen and Charles white as his running backs it's white 35 down at the 39 yard line white is a marked man here tonight there's a big banner that says Death Valley 12 on the Richter scale Death Valley that's the affectionate nickname for Tiger Stadium I can certainly see why 76 is 7,000 people and they get here very early and start to party and they're ready but game time gain of five second and five at the 39 of Southern California white with 57 yards and eight carries it's the fullback Marcus Allen busts up to the 42 Lester has it the LSU defense forces the big play LSU now with with great field position to it and a chance to be conservative I'm anxious to see what Charlie McClendon wants to do try to score quickly or use that field position no way we could tell who came up with a loose ball but one of the Tigers day and it's LSU in the first down at the Southern California 42 yard line Tigers already leading six to three gripping to get some more Edwards Spurling Lepke the down lineman for us see the pitch goes to the tailback Leroy Jones the string at him out Jones has to struggled again to near the 40yard line Mike it's not a waste of time but I think Charlie McClendon is is making an error when he tries to run directly at the Trojan defense on first down see Hawkins made the tackle he's had success at least getting people open passing on first down out of those what you call double and triple formations and I think that's what he's going to have to do to move the football second and a long eight for LSU while there the Southern California 40 Jude Hernandez is the lone running back against minger who's thrown one touchdown pass fires and complete tumorfree at the 20yard line jerry Murphree the flanker bag well LSU brought a receiver deep across the middle Ricky gray number 35 did a great job getting deep enough to stick a hand up there I don't know if he got the ball or not it was slightly overthrown but that is a difficult when you spread everybody out it is difficult I don't know what we're seeing right here but but we're seeing ty Sperling fight his way through but the rush on Ensminger was put on by Larry McGrew third down and eight at the 40yard line Hernandez though running back ends finger wants to throw on third and eight cross the middle east man placing quarter 25 out of bounds around the SC 29 once again Ensminger had plenty of time to throw the ball and he brought a receiver all the way across the field it's very difficult to follow someone all the way across the field we saw Scoggins following and now LSU has great field position a pickup of twenty yards first down for LSU at the Southern California 20 Leroy Jones is the tailback Leroy gets the call prize the middle and it gives only to pie Sperling on the hip second and eight at the SC 18 let's watch the clock now 3:18 left's in the second quarter 13 more hours and you want to taste of a truly great American beer tonight let it be low and brown a beautiful she we have a new safety 4sc Kenny more replacing Dennis Smith and Jude Hernandez just limped off the field for LSU he's the fullback Danny swallow number 27 the lone running back swallow gets the call and follows the blocking of John Watson swallow doesn't go very far just down to the 16 yard line picking up of only two tackle made by Brad screamin that was LSU's third time trying to trap play and that was not the charming situation to do it Charlie McClendon now in a position where a piece scores has got the Trojans in a real bind in its first half it's 6 to 3 LSU LSU scored at a pass play from Ensminger to Jones inswinger running for his life unloads and it is intercepted by Ronnie Lott but they roll he trapped the ball lock comes up with it alright but the ruling is heat trap the ball Fred Streelman number 9 he put good pressure on Ensminger he was lucky to get the ball away it was almost intercepted you see Streelman coming out for containment a chicken number 78 also let's see if lot perhaps the ball or not yeah good call you know on most of the replays the officials do have the correct call all right we'll get a field gold attempt the holder will be Dave Woodley the center John Ed Bradley and the kicker is Don Barthel he's a transfer from Northeast Mississippi junior college it looks good it is our fifth goal by John Bartell and LSU now has a isn't it a beauty a Datsun 280zx and it's all mine ours my gladly prize to see before we settle for something else place the Datsun 280zx don't let that styling that luxury that performance mislead you you could get an epaestimated City range of 350 miles in time a range of over 550 on one tank of gas price of Datsun 280zx it costs less than you think and gives us more used to trip free he's supposed to be under the steps hey gentlemen my country estate is at your disposal there might even be a little something in the refrigerator regards better speed over ground l\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u when you want the taste of a truly great American beer tonight let it be l\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u is the Hank wherever he is there's the man are just good at the 33yard field goal Don Marcel ready to kick off too let's see what standing about the three good boot by Barthel Butler is backed up three yards bounces the ball a couple of automatic touchback a penalty marker however dropped it around the 32yard line the LSU Tigers drooped around a referee Joe Hicks so far no preliminary signal holding against Southern California LSU nine to three the penalty has been declined by LSU so the Trojans will have a first down following the automatic cuts back despite the fact that the Trojans were guilty of holding line of scrimmage is the 20yard line of SC Marcus Allen Charles white the running backs for Paul McDonald is Rock Shawnee moves out it is white up to the 25 put down by Ivan Phillips obviously John Robinson would like to get some field position whoops another penalty against the Trojans that's one thing in the first three games the Trojans operated with a minimum of penalties in the victories over Texas Tech Oregon State in Minnesota well this is a very difficult place to play it's a tight game you've got to come from behind now you've got a big ranking I think I saw number 68 Keith van Horn move a little bit in the line of scrimmage before the snap ball goes back to the 15yard line and although it's only a fiveyard penalty actually it's ten because white picked up five that of course is nullified it'll be first and 15 now at the 15yard line 229 till the intermission which goes to white right to the outside 25 30 35 40 Audubon's right in front of the SC been shot a bounce around the 43 yard line Robert de ruddy the safety managed to just bump him hard enough to get him out of bounds at the 43 Mike I'm gonna say something may sound a little crazy as we watched Charlie white on student body right again I think the pressure in this game even though LSU is a hit 9 to 3 is on LSU's defense it appears to me that with the exception of the passing from the triples which I think can be solved USC has the quite an advantage in the offensive game both defense is playing well a gain of 28 by Charles white he now has 95 yards here in the first half first down for the Trojans at their own 43 penalty markers dropped all over the place illegal procedure against Southern California well done mows bar number 72 the weak side tackle and a freshman a little anxious to get back on pass protection started moving before the snap of the ball you think the crowds getting to the offensive line I don't really I don't I don't think that's it I think it's just a little bit of nervousness you want to do a good job it's a it's a big game it's every games a big one but this is the first really big one of this season LSU leading nine to three thanks to a 13yard touchdown pass from Ensminger to Leroy Jones in the 32yard field goal by Barthel s he is countered with a field goal from the 32 by Eric hip white sent up 40 Brittles his way up to the 43 and it is slammed down hard at the 43 yard line a pickup of five more yards by white who is now right at the century mark for this game a 100 yards and now with one minute and 56 seconds where I guess you could say we're in the twominute drill with field position like this as you watched Charlie white again and Charlie White is running well tonight I can tell you that it'll be second on eight at the 44yard line Kevin Williams moves up he becomes the flanker back McDonnell heavy rice McDonnell has it knocked away now the question is did he fumble the ball or was he hit as he was cocking the arm back to throw bowling on that ball was bris foot the Center for Southern California well it's academic now but someone came scotfree on an outside blitz it appeared to be a fumble in the replay to me da was a good thing that Chris foot was covering the senior center from Boulder Colorado third down a loss of four it will be third and 14 for the Trojans McDonald on the delay off to Allen Allen to the 50 down to the 44 yard line and he may have a first down Marcus Allen the sophomore from Lincoln High in San Diego Marcus Quinn the strong safety finally reading down it will be a first down for Southern California docked to the LSU 47 yard line I would expect USC to start using timeouts s he's got one timeout left we have 29 seconds remaining in the second quarter McDonald wants to throw McDonald may run runs up to the line and fires it is it Quadron otters at traffic it's caught at the 35 yard line with 16 seconds left printer made the catch holy Brenner John Robinson has got to decide whether he wants to go for one or two passes in a field goal or try to get that ball in the end zone you can see McDonald going back he's going to lose his protection run out of his pocket he obviously wanted to go deep Hobie Brenner was coming back toward the ball made a fine catch a gain of 12 and that'll stop the clock while they moved the chains first down for SC oh what a boost it would be per se to score here in the final 16 seconds of the first half first down for the Trojans at the LSU 35 McDonnell pulls back McDonnell throws caught by Ray Butler Butler goes down to the 11 yard line Mike Raymond Butler that was the great call LSU and a two deep defense the safety men not going to get beat deep you had to bring somebody across the middle as Steve did it great play then that'll stop the clock with nine seconds to go now the clock is being cranked up again they haven't even moved the chain gang yet they've cranked up the clock here's the field goal by Eric if it's up it is no good now I do not understand that how could they run that play they hadn't even moved the chain gang well I assume the officials give you a reasonable amount of time and that's what they felt was richness but they did not move the chain that's the end of the first half with LSU Milligan exactly when I was a young man starting out in business I thought that someday I would own the world so I started to read The Wall Street Journal it held the journal helped I moved right along in business but after a few years I realized that I wasn't ever going to own the world and you know what he didn't want to anyway all I wanted was to do my best so I kept on reading The Wall Street

Monte Carlo has the same mileage but more miles per tankful than these smaller foreign cars more room and comfort more miles per tank Chevrolet Monte Carlo for LSU and USC but the Tigers are leading nine to three and individually Charles White has a hundred yards here in the first half and you would think if he had had that type of a half this season have a couple of touchdowns but that is not the my guess he hasn't had maybe a lot of 15yard penalty but they've had three or four fiveyard penalty and they they put themselves in long yardage situations LSU has been too good of a defensive team you can't allow them to put you there you're behind see almost score just before the half they missed the field goal we've got 9 2 3 s he has been penalized six times for 41yard jealous Jew just

more miles per tank Chevy Malibu word from the SC bench is that Dennis Smith has a bruised shoulder I don't know if he's going to play anymore tonight or not he is the SC safety nine to three LSU Barthel kicks off to ray Butler Butler at the 315 20 up to the 25 yard line Raymond Butler tackle made by Willie teal Mike adjustment time is over that's one of the purposes of halftime let's see what both teams have done to improve their situations two three LSU the Trojans for the first down at their own 25yard line Marcus Allen Charles white the running backs for Paul McDonald Kevin Williams is the flanker Mick Rock Shani will be Brenner in there for us see it's Charles white to the 30 who and he's hit right smack dab on the face pass there at the 32 yard line by Marcus Quinn they almost collided with their cages so far we're right back to the beginning of the game LSU over shifted strong USC runs weak Charlie white uses his speed and goes outside and it's a good game for the Trojans a sevenyard pickup white now has a hundred and seven yards second and three at the 32 long caught by McDonald it's white again 35 40 45 and he pulls ahead and in his outofbounds right at the midfield stripe will eat eel running out of bounds in front of the LSU Tiger bench obviously John Robinson and his staff have said nobody can do this to us they can't shift strong side put the strong safety almost in the line in an unblockable position Charlie White's too good and these two plays he has been too good a 19 yard pickup for white first and 10 Southern California at the LSU 49 coach ins taking the kickoff here at the start of the second half and they've got it down to the LSU 49 white again white for 4 maybe 5 yards more tackle by Benji Thibodeau and Lyman white with some assistance from Georgia Tia on the left side of the LSU Tiger defense the ball will be spotted at the 44 yard line pick up a 5 very impressive drive so far by the Trojans good blocking up front John Robinson very calm cool and collected right now white for the hundred and thirty one yards and 13 carries from the LSU 44 it is white again has to really struggle this time to get to the 40 yard line Tom Frisell stops Charles white after the 4 yard advance will now go to the two tight end offense with the Trojans having about Oh a long one for a first down Garcia goes up Toby Brenner Vic Rock Shani ray for the seabirds along with third and one at the forty books wait a minute Williams is not in there Raksha Nia's replaced Williams go chance need a yard her first down it's white he's got the first down and then some as he slants down to the 36 of LSU Charlie White showed his class on that play Mike Robert too runny the safety made the tackle LSU got penetration somebody met Marcus Allen pretty tough in the backfield white made a great athletic adjustment and got the first down a new tailback for Southern California Michael Hayes Charles white cuts to the sidelines for a breather first and ten at the LSU 36 Rock Shawnee goes up the pitch to Mike Hayes 35 Hays to the 30 down to the 29 Mike Hayes picking up 6 to 7 yards Brad buddy number 71 pulled out clean got upfield good blocking up front van Hoorn the rest of the strong side must have been a fine job that was that was a big hole a gain of six by A's and it looks like the Trojans at halftime said okay guys let's get our act together and start moving them out of there second and four at the 30 Kevin Williams split to the right side Marcus Allen 25 Marcus Allen to the 23 yard line Marcus Quinn making the tackle and another push down for Southern California ball will be spotted down at the 23yard line pickup of seven by Ellen remember this drive started back at the SC 25 and now they've got it down to the LSU 23 LSU leading 9 to 3 Williams moves over he's the blanket to the right the pitch to my cage to the right side Hayes is dumped down near the 20 yard line by linebacker Jerry Hill it appears that John Robinson at halftime simply challenged his team and said gentlemen can we move the football on the ground or not no passes in this drive and a very impressive win so far gain of two by Hayes suck at at 8 at the LSU 21 this has been a well executed drive for the Trojans second at 8 at the 21 Garcia is wide to the left side Marcus Allen and Charles white the running backs for McDonald the pitch to white he's at the 20 out of bounds around the 16 yard line like no one on the on the LSU line of scrimmage is getting penetration in this Drive with the exception of one time against Marcus Allen you suppose he's hurt white it appears he's adjusting his shoulders almost scared me there for a moment he was holding that side I thought my goodness it might be the bruised shoulder again as you well know he's working it with a special shoulder pad designed by the trainer Jack Ward ball we'll be third and 2 at the 15yard line in motion Rock Shawnee its Marcus Allen he stopped it weight at the 16 yard line the tackle made by Marcus Quinn well now we have a very interesting situation with maybe 9 seconds left and a half time Robinson decided to go for a field goal now with fourth and a little over two does he want to stay with the ball as you watch LSU finally getting some penetration and Marcus Allen being stopped number forty was Marcus Quinn number 94 lime and white and the Trojans are going for it on 4th and along to 10:30 to play in the third quarter 9 to 3 LSU leading Charles white he's got the first down as white buses way down to the 13 yard line Willie teal on the hit Mike that's got to be a gutsy call and certainly a big play and LSU has a man down on the field as you watch what has to be the blast and Charlie white going up over the top men on the field just getting up now is Ivan Phillips the defensive tackle first down although they're going to have a measurement but it looks from here like they've got it yep they do first down look like they had a yard despair there's Ivan Phillips as the LSU trainer works on it first and ten at the LSU 13 yard line the Trojans have had the ball for 12 plays at the start of this second half first and ten s see if the LSU 13 LSU leading nine to three 1006 to play third period here comes watch honey and here comes Charles White makes his cut at the 15 falls down at the 14 white lost his footing and a penalty marker goes down white was hit late by Demetri Williams and there is the personal foul call against LSU LSU I don't think it was a very flagrant one but it was a good call I think we're going to see Marcus Allen get met in the backfield and Charlie White has to do some adjusting and simply slipped as he tries to cut back he's obviously down and the hit wasn't flagrant but it was the late hit that was not he Demitri Williams barreling Enza white so that's going to cost them half the distance and the ball will be spotted down at the 8 yard line first I'm going to go at the 8 yard line Dan Garcia goes out we have three tight ends Hobie Brenner Nick Raksha me James hunter operating for USA Bruce foot kind of walks away 72 Moe's bar 89 Brenner first and goal at the LSU eight Marcus Allen up in front of Charles white crowd making a lot of noise years walk Shani moves to the right penalty marker goes down white goes to the two yard line let's wait and see about the penalty illegal procedure against Southern California someone in the offensive line moving just a little bit you must be still for one full second before that ball is snapped and that play was was going to go down somewhere near the 2 or 3 yard line before the penalty now that'll move the ball back to the 12 yard line just outside of the 12 so it'll be still it appears to me that John Robinson said at halftime gentlemen we're not going to pass the football we're gonna run it and we're going to score I don't know that but I have that feeling and with this down in distance he's got three downs to make a little over nine yards maybe 9 yards in a foot for a first down let's see what he does suckin down the ball is back at the LSU 12 there's Rock Shani the fake to Alan and white has Gail back at the 17 by Markus Quinn when number 40 junior strong safety from New Orleans making the hip dropping Charles white fro Lhasa for a little bit of a whatever you want to call it a fella option a little bit of a counter option whatever something a little different LSU's whole plan was let's get some penetration and upset something they happen to have the right defense called at the right time now it's stirred down the ball is back at the LSU 16 McDonald McDonagh looking for williams dumps it off over to white incomplete at a four yard line Kris Williams was covering in Williams thought he should have had an interception look at him smack the ground well several people might have caught the ball but no one did and now USC is going for a field goal meanwhile the LSU defense causing this crowd already a rouse to a fever pitch three hours before game time to go a little more firstsearch well you can see McDonald's protection breaking down he's trying to get someone to make a move wait slips and now field well I think he really wanted to throw to Kevin Williams holding will be Fisher ball spotted down at the 22 the field goal attempt by Eric if it is wide to the right no fair and listen to this crowd we have a 29 to play enough third quarter LSU we want a nimble way to beat the high price of gas get a ghast ng frontwheel drive Datsun 310 high dots and mileage to keep you away from the punks with a big first intent LSU at the 20yard line and Dennis Smith is in there at safety for USC he was hurt late in the second quarter Danny swallow picks up three swallow the fullback like that last offensive drive for the Trojans had to be a frustrating one I know I know has enough offensive lineman when you blocked that well and you move right down the field it just it gets to you you can only stand so many of those it's tough to hang in and when you come up empty as the Trojans did that's got to have an adverse effect second at seven at the 23 the LSU Tigers dine Southern California three Woodley at quarterback on the option hurdles his way to the 25 26 yard line put down by linebacker Ricky gray well this is going to be a big play regardless of what LSU does if the Trojans can stop LSU now get the ball right back and be as impressive as they were it's going to take something out of the Tigers a gain of three by the quarterback Woodley third down and three at the 27 Woodley was ineffective in the first quarter and Charlie McClendon took him out in favor of Steve Ensminger and ends me the only touchdown of the game a power I left formation on third and three for LSU quarterback rolls out he's got the first out of inside David would lay up to the 32 yard line first down LSU a wellexecuted quarterback keeps something the Trojans have done themselves in the past the ball spotted out at the 34 yard line first and 10 LSU at the 34 Woodley has swallow at fullback Woodley pumps right into the tailback Leroy Jones and Jones knocks down Woodley I'm sure someone just didn't get the play because I don't think the tailback belongs in that spot it looked to me like it was going to be an option play and it's things like that when you don't get to put play you stop yourself both teams have done just a little bit of that tonight second and 11 for LSU at their own 33 Wallace leaves Carson is back in its split end for LSU Woodley Sprint's out to the right throws over on incomplete over there on the play was Dennis Johnson and man that he have Lafleur the tight end well covered excellent pass coverage by Dennis Johnson number 56 who it usually gets his hand on one ball in every game the tight end running the little crease pass pattern Johnson reading it well Johnson almost had the interception he almost had a chance Woodley is old for five in the game ends winger came in and really sparked him we have 612 to go in this third quarter Mike Walden and Dave levy from LSU Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge on 3rd and 11 in motion comes Leroy Jones Woodley wants to blow he's in trouble now he's going to go back the other way and he's got an open field 4045 4045 247 when we say Woodley is a little bit ineffective on the past he takes a broken pass play and makes a very big play out of it a gain of 15 yards on the run by davidich Woodley from Shreveport Louisiana first and ten at the LSU 48 tackle on Woodley was finally made by Jeff Fischer 9 3 LSU six minutes to go in the third quarter Woodley pitches back to Jones Jones 40 35 30 25 20 kills out of bounds at the 14 yard get it up player make the tackle and Mike it appeared to me that the right tackle of LSU definitely moved before the ball the official apparently disagrees and that is a big flake 38 yards for LSU well a lot missed the tackle almost at the line of scrimmage and that makes long run when you can get outside the contain man must make the stop there's the man Leroy Jones getting a new use of beautiful on my New Jersey first and ten at the L at the SC 14 this is John Hernandez cometh cold and the LSU offensive line coming to life the best blocking by far by the Tigers so far in this football game and to say they're fired up is it's just not strong enough can see it's a cutback play sort of a trap the whole really open up and they come back to bring down Jeff Fischer had to get him down first and goal ago the ball halfway between the 2 and the 3 yard line of SC power I write formation Jessie miles is the tailback and this is miles stucked at the 1 Ricky gray flying through there to make contact let's see where they got a spot the ball as miles number 14 goes back into the huddle we could have spotted at the two second and goal at the SC two nine three LSU but the Tigers running to get a score right here Mike you might say it's too much to ask a defense to stop someone with less than two or about two yards with three downs to do it but if you're going to be a really great team sometimes it's got to be done ty Sperling the nose guard has a bad shoulder hi Sperling is going off assisted by warden Paul Williams Mike it appears to be his right knee which is taped already he's not putting any weight on it at first they seem to be pointing to his shoulder though Georgia chica a freshman from San Jose will try to fill up the middle on defense and that's a tough task a freshman who was just 18 years old playing before 76,000 plus well the one thing you cannot do is stand up got to stay down low he stays down low and penetrates then he'll really have done a great job second and goal at the Southern California 213 as Hernandez 9 as Leroy Jones it is quite a be Tracy Porter and he's going to be wrapped up by Ward back at the 11 perv Ward a big play by the Trojan defense a really big play in Georgia chica number 78 although he did not make the tackle came in for Seiberling he made one heck of a move and he did stay down and he did get penetration per board number 23 quarter by Larry law loss of 9 and herb just got him by the pants and finally held on to the leg is that a shoestring tackle no except that's a whatever that is it may turn out to be a gamesaving tackle we'll see out of the eye this time Leroy Jones as the tailback Fernandez the fullback Woodley rolling out got plenty of time into the end zone caught by Carson Carlos Carson had it for justice foot second and then lost it a great play by herb Ward again number 23 LSU doing a great job tonight getting time to throw the football SC not getting close to the quarterbacks hardly at all Woodley is now hold for six watch it again oh it's right there and Carson is fighting it lost it right there we're bored stuck his right hand right through and knocked the ball out here's a field gold attempt now from the 18 yard line holding will be Woodley the kickers Barthel it's up it is yard field goal by barzell and LSU now on three new pilot ships out to open sea through currents that can run you a ground and the only map you trust is the one you keep in your head now comes Miller time time to head back for the best tasting beer you can find Miller High Life time to realize we've got the beer Miller isn't it a beauty a Datsun 280zx and it's all mine ours my gladly prize to see before we settle for something else race a Datsun 280zx don't let that styling that luxury that performance mislead you there was no change in scores both teams were unable to move the ball we picked up now with SC Inquisition later in the same period first and ten for Southern California at the 20yard line 29 seconds left in the third quarter 12 to 3 LSU the pitch to white Charles white to the outside fumbles out of bounds at the 25 they will spot the ball around the 24 so credit white with a gain of four Jerry Hill with good pursuit for LSU like this this LSU defense is too good for the Trojans to try long marches without mixing their attack the problem is LSU placed so much mantoman they bring outside linebackers they've done a good job keeping Paul McDonald offbalance ray Butler split left in motion goes white McDonald wants to throw to white at the 20 white slashed back in and has stopped at the 23 yard line that actually is a 1yard loss for us see George attea doing a good job on defense for LSU third and seven at the 23 next into the third quarter the Tigers roaring away hey wish you want a truck full of gas well now you can own a car full of gas mileage the incredible Datsun 210 hatchback our highest gas mileage car number one so why for your money down the tank by your buddy in the bank not in the tank collab marketing Tiger Stadium first play in the 4th quarter on 3rd and 7 McDonald under heavy pressure screams it off complete over 2 Marcus Allen and Alan can only get up to the 27 yard line a pickup before it'll be 4th and 3 and Southern California will have to punt Mike that was a good call it just wasn't quite good enough LS his defense really scrambling they were bringing people you think the man would be open but somebody had him mantoman and was close to him he made a fine play Dave Pryor in punt formation the boot by player it's a good one this time it'll be grabbed by Kris Williams he retreats to the 30 and his nail right at the 30 yard line LSU wasn't able to move the ball so we pick up the action with USC's next series of downs Marcus Allen and Charles white the running backs from the 43 McDonald fakes throws to Kevin Williams he has the ball at the 40 yard line of LSU his knee touched down at the 39 fake fake by McDonald a good fake I thought sure he was going to throw the ball of the tight end Hobie Brenner who was wide open instead he chose to not force the ball in but really have to make a fine throw because Kevin Williams was covered pretty well gain of 17 Hurst eye on a sea of the LSU 40 Williams in motion Marcus Allen 35:30 Allen down to the 25yard line Marcus Allen sprinting 15 yards with a good tough run brought down by Robert De Ruffy and Willie teal and the Trojans with a first down at the tiger 25 Trojans started this Drive throwing on first down when LSU was in there run defense let's see if John Robinson wants to continue to credit shake up that balance he's got Garcia wide to the left Williams moving in motion to the lab looking for Garcia now coming back the other way dumps it off to Hobie Brenner and Hobie Brenner goes down to the 18 Hobie Brenner well it's obvious that Paul McDonald has not lost his poise or his cool he wanted to go outside to Garcia he was covered he looked back Hobie Brenner delay broke over the middle Trojans in excellent field position with three downs to make two yard albert richardson and Jerry hill on the tackle our thanks to Jim Hefner Jeff theorem for their assistance on the telecast tonight on a statistician Scott Alvey second and three at the LSU 18 Rock Shawnee in motion McDonald gives the white 15 gang tackle down at the 15yard line a great cut by Charlie White once again the outside will look with if LSU might call them defensive ends really meeting Marcus Allen the fullback in the backfield Charlie white undoubtedly anticipating it slows up a little and breaks inside and gets the first down first down indeed the ball just across the 15 first and ten at the LSU 15 the Tigers leading 12 to 3 we have a little over 10 minutes to play walk Shawnee back this way the pitch to white cuts in at the 15 now he's outside to the 10 the 5 down to the 3 yard line Charles white brought down by Robert Davi at the free Mike you can almost feel the frustration being vetted by the Trojan offense on this Drive Charlie white is known for getting tougher as games get going and here he goes to the outside Loras his his sore shoulder as it worked and first and goal at the LSU three the Trojans using three tight ends Rock Shawnee Brenner and Hunter to give us the white touchdown USA for that zone of the field of tremendous hole and in this Drive no one moved before the snap of the ball and it made all of the difference in the Trojan offensive execution white now has racked up a hundred and sixtyseven yards in 25 carries it's 12 to 9 and Eric hip will attempt the extra point out of the hold of Jeff Fisher the center will be like McDonald hip is 14 out of 14 in extra point attempts it's up it's gone Eric hip adds the extra point night with 954 left in this game for Baton Rouge the Trojans failed to satisfy customers by Chevrolet dealers than any other make in the USA Chevrolet is number one mile after mile year after year we don't want you just for a season we don't want you just for a year for Southern California all the stunts he wants without paying extra boy that was a drive up 57 yards in six plays with white scoring from three yards out 12 to 10 Rob Kerr is ready to kick off the deep man for LSU is Williams Chris William it'll be Williams at the five Williams trying to go up the middle and was successful up to the 24 yard line tackled by Kenny Moore the pressure is now on the LSU offense let's see if coach McClendon decides to stay loose and sort of uh get there the way he got there before and throw that ball from those triple formations or if he's going to draw his neck in a little bit and try to eat that clock up don't forget we'll have the replay for you next Sunday Washington State and USC and the coach's show right here on channel 9 with John Robinson every Saturday night at 11 first and ten at the 24 yard line of LSU the quarterback Woodley on the option play pitches to the trailing back that is Jones Leroy Jones to the 36 yard line the option gets the Tigers 12 important yards the tackle made by Myron Lepke number nine Leroy Jones Mike what's making these option plays effective when they go outside for LSU is the define blocking that LSU's wide receivers are doing on USC secondary they're not really knocking them over but they're really staying with and credit Leroy Jones with doing a good job for hokey guys on who was hurt in the first half Jones has 67 yards in ten carries this is Jude Hernandez the fullback probably nothing stopped it around the line of scrimmage they might give him one yard you might ask why what LSU want to run that play they're doing it because they've had some success with us these linebackers really really flowing out of there fast if they can beat the nose guard and they're trying to beat a freshman Georgia chica they might pop into the secondary Edwards had a chance to spill him for a loss he got her on Edwards but chip banks put it on him so call it second and 10 at the 36 12 to 10 LSU leading Southern California 843 to go in the game Woodley fires the pass complete to Carlos person up to the 47 yard line of LSU pushed on for the Tigers to me like Woodley saw 42 lot on the line of scrimmage either faking the Blitz or expecting the Blitz a gutsy call and a wellexecuted slant in pass and it was verb wore to had to make the tackle a gain of 12 yards first and 10 LSU at the 48 of the Tigers out of the I formation Hernandez and Jones the running backs would Leon the option he's going to carry and Woodley runs right into a linebacker Larry McGrew stopped up the SC forty nine credit Woodley with a gain of three well obviously LS she likes the option play they have a lot of faith in Woodleigh and rightly so of what he's done in this second half USC's consecutive game winning streak is 8:11 and it's on the line right here in Baton Rouge second and seven at the SC 49 the handoff the Hernandez Fernandez goes to the 46 gain of about three John Robinson puts his left hand out as if to say okay there's Gil Haskell one of the assistant coaches number eight is Kevin Williams 86 Butler Mike let's say it again big big play time LSU has to get something out of this player I think Charlie McClendon would choose to punch but if they get close to a first down he might go for it it's third and four at the SC 46 seven minutes left in the game LSU leading 12 to 10 Woodley wants to throw quickie batted up in the air and complete now what is LSU and the Tigers do I think there was fire and Darby who batted that ball up in the air the freshman from Inglewood well a lot of freshmen are making big plays tonight and there's no question that was a big one because USC is now going to get the football back at least it appears that way when I was a young man starting out in business I thought that someday I would own so I started to read The Wall Street Journal it held the journal helped I moved right along in business but after a few years I realized that I wasn't ever going to own the world and you know what he didn't want to anyway all I wanted was to do my best so I kept on reading The Wall Street Journal and the journal helped it helped me to do my best and these days well these days I still want to know I have to know what's going on in business I want to keep in touch so I still read the Wall Street Journal and the journal still helps it keeps me in touch I guess I've spent all my adult life of the journal it hasn't failed me yet you can get twenty weeks of the journal for $22 call 1800 331 1009 thats 1800 331 1009 you'll be billed later do it now The Wall Street Journal it hasn't failed anyone yet there was no change in scores both teams were unable to move the ball we pick up now with SC in position later in the same period from the SC 22 yard line lock Shawnee goes in motion MacDonald wants to throw dishes it off the rock Shani up to the 31st down for the Trojans as lock Shani is brought down at the 36 yard line tackle was made by Tommy Frisell don't forget next week it'll be SC in Washington State back in the Coliseum a 1:30 kickoff and we'll have the tape replay for you next Sunday at 3 o'clock on channel line a big first down it gives the Trojans some breathing room date of 14 on that play first and ten at the 36 of Southern California MacDonald wants to go long and think for Kevin Williams Williams oh he just couldn't get the ball at the 25 yard line Williams said his man beating the ball was overthrown at just just a few feet it was a good call everything but perfect execution as you look at Paul McDonald he is 11 out of 7 he almost clicked on this one to the speedy Kevin Williams Old MacDonald has a lot of poise and one fine passing arm and Kevin Williams has in ten at the Southern California 36 347 left to pitch the white 35 white is dropped at the 36 there will be no gain on that one and now it is third and ten at the 36 and now you would expect LSU to drop up and play pass defense but they've had pretty good success forcing McDonald out of the pocket and disrupting his timing by bringing their outside linebackers let's see what they do for the Trojans to get a first down they've got to go up to the 46 yard line their own 46 McDonald to throw McDonald under heavy pressure he escapes penalty marker goes down McDonnell was able to twist away from one and a penalty marker was dropped let's see what this is all about Benjie Thibodeau the tackle wrapped up MacDonald look at Charlie McClendon follow it went against us you are with other witch LS you could be a nose guard penalty I I thought I saw one official signaling that I'm much you look at much London bloody the gyrations he's going through Kathy grabbing his assistant by the cello Charlie Mac have a pretty dramatic man and obviously fired up his team's done a great job tonight but he doesn't want to get a penalty from the sidelines no and also he is concerned because it appeared that they had the Trojans stop and now we'll see what the penalty still no signal from the referee but if it's a facemask it'll give the Trojan to first down John McDonald and Paul Hackett Hudson out here's to walk off well Mike this is a tremendous break for the Trojans let's see if they can take advantage of yep that's it grabbing the face pass of Paul McDonald and the proteins gonna pick right there first down at the LSU 49 yard line LSU 12 SC 10 a little under three minutes left Jolyon motion the pitch the white at the 50 stopped at the 49 like remember the Trojans don't need a touchdown all they need is a field goal for 13 to 12 good point Dave levy so John Robinson's strategy is and you can see Charlie White if the hole was there he was going to try to bust it there was nothing there he wrapped that ball up with both arms the idea is to get a first down Rock Shawnee wide to the left along with Dan Garcia second and 10 at the LSU 49 now white goes in motion MacDonald he's got his man at the 35 first down for Southern California at the 33 yard line the grab made by Danny Garcia and remember that era Kip in junior college once kicked a 57yard field goal distance has not been his problem you can see Paul McDonald very poised looking for Garcia breaking in over the curl pattern first on for the Trojans at the LSU 33 we have two minutes left 12 to 10 LSU devin williams coming back the other way the pitch to Charles white 35 white at the 30 white goes down to the 27 or the 8 yard line I would expect USC would start to use timeouts fairly soon a minute and 45 left they've got all three left there's no use going in with somebody tired now and risking a fumble pick up a 5 5 white white has a hundred and 75 yards second and five at the 28yard line of LSU right Butler wide to the right side white gets only a yard white stopped at the 27yard line the tackle made by John Adams right about the 28 yard line third and four yes further than four at the 28 McDonald fakes he's been a throw McDonald throws on the run a grab is made at the 10yard line michaelah was a great call in an unbelievable pass in catch by Hobie Brenner Hobie Brenner is becoming a clutch pass receiver and Paul McDonald the clock shows 62 seconds left a minute and two seconds to go a bootleg pass for the Trojans and McDonald threw that ball and Hobie Brenner grabbed it now the ball is at the 10 yard line first down for the Trojans they its first and goal to go it's just over the 10 here is white Charles white has stocked up at about the 8 yard line the clock moving 40 seconds McDonald will call a timeout every time now yuppie just call one that stops the clock with 37 seconds the Trojans will have one more time out after this 37 seconds they'll probably use the running play there definitely I mean it's actually a chip shot from here it's just an accuracy shot Eric Epps problem has not been distance his problem has been accuracy but is past record is he can put him through in the clutch so this has been a tough night indeed for Southern California here in Baton Rouge their winning streak is on the line they fell behind 12 to 3 trying to catch up here in the final 37 seconds and pull it out Mike John Robinson and Paul Hackett are over talking with Paul McDonald with 37 seconds slab you're really not pressing the clock you've got a timeout you could call a pass play and if it's safe and you trust your quarterback and you're not worried about your your protection it may be the very good thing to do you could get the six points but you really have to trust your quarterback second and goal for Southern the LSU a McDonald dumps it off to Devin Williams cuts down USA well it's pretty obvious John Robinson press Paul McDonald in that combination of Kevin Williams and McDonald his magic and the Trojans have shown a lot of class under a lot of pressure Paul McDonald is now throwing a touchdown pass in his last eight straight games and that is his 25th career touchdown pass and about 2000 SC supporters across the way are on their feet Yellin and screamin they don't make much noise here in tiger town Baton Rouge but they can be heard from a back of the SC bench Erik hips kicks the extra point so with 32 seconds left but punches have taken a 172 probably over LSU we want a nimble way to beat the high price of gas get a gas stingy frontwheeldrive Dotson 3:10 high Dotson mileage but remember this game is not over

they are on grave Franklin the blocking back at fullback the I back or tailback in that I formation Rick burns he'll be teaming up with I am hip at that position and the wing back Kenny bro junior Vela the tight end and they like to go to that big tight end target he's 6 4 and Frank Lockett miss Whitten Brown wing right lockets book left maybe just where they want to attack they're going to go right up the middle as they can that's what they did in their earlier game and let's look at the offensive line that's going to be trying to blow those holes all Americans Kelvin Clark Party caucus Kelly Saltville Steve Lindquist and very fine senior guard and Tom oars and they're big the lightest man in that interior five is 248 pounds burns again back out for the 29 where it'll be third down and one running against this Oklahoma defense as quick they are that's the word to describe people like Reggie Mathis John Goodman Reggie Kinlan the nose bill Taber seniors writes a comment Bruce take small right if George come P of Daryl Hannah the linebacker Oh and earns goes the other way six f11 and before Ken lon can collaborate from the end zone let's look at that play big first down play door they giving it up to Burns's I back first cuts it back underneath gets away from hunts dumpy right there runs out of the tackle some powerful running what a great year he says great blocks by 54 cotton man 39 Franklin here's the one Egyptian why Reggie Kinlaw was there to be festive back for Oklahoma faithful bank J here misses at the corners Darrel ray and Mike Babb that play by the way is one of their favorites they picked it outside they can look like they're sorry go outside and then touch back against the green but one of the things that happens to you quick back side pursuit they could shut you down exactly first penalty of the game the brass one of the things we're going to have to get used to those 15yard old egg family that's a tenyard friendly but I really shut you down in the college game because you've got a first in 25 and that's a hard piece of real estate to gain back so Tom Sorley number 12 the quarterback from Big Spring be forced to go to the damas or they love to go to junior miller what an athlete he is watching it now totally running outside Miller knows he's going to get a pass here watch the concentrate conduction back underneath Darrel ray makes us the Ferb catch marked down where his knee touches the ground junior Miller made up to 25 event Oklahoma Territory at least on this first possession Nebraska's offensive line is bidding Oklahoma to the punt now this game was described as feed against strength right now straight seems to be winning down to the fifth Rick burns 933 yards finished just three yards behind I am the other I back burn the career down as burns short of the first down tackled at the 38yard line check the penalty referee can Faulkner's and offside Nebraska and all Southwest Conference crew can softare Marvin during burger WC common 147 years of officiating experience the Zebras today well we have one from the Southeast Conference our timekeepers from the Southeast Conference and he's the only one they try and bring neutral officials in they've done this this is the fourth year I think a wise decision on the part of the commissioners of the various conferences on that last play that you get the call here of outside Oklahoma was listening and they brought a demon see back up and I think whoever was responsible for him was getting a little itchy in there tried to get a jump got out little too quick Mike van has moved to a corner for Oklahoma for what Taylor injured earlier in the year sorry to throw since their secondary and also in the backfield of Nebraska it looks like one of them might be for roughing the passer go back and start it over again going to be second night again the Oklahoma team is adding an extra linebacker there are going with three defensive backs as they did on that last way trying to get almost a goal line side situation in order to stop the running attack of like four dusters Braska Hannah now they've got their Ford events in effect and it's still second in a they'll fight forward for a couple of yards number 72 John Goodman from Garland Texas the left tackle made the first contact could not bring down burns burns running very hard took Goodman helmet right in his chest and kept on going he had what's up get third down six congratulations to Bear Bryant Alabama team knocking off the top rated then the last time he became fast Notre Dame rallying while the went 3534 in the cotton ball as you saw an NBC USC 17 Michigan 10 Charlie will go through the play the Ritchie Mathis 58 was banan pressuring sorely and getting up slowly his Rick burned with Phil taper and Darryl hunt for most tackles behind the line of scrimmage disease going to be very close to a first down in fact they're going over to measure it up I believe on the on the 6th to see if it would indeed be a first down but that's that's big penalty third is five in a situation where the path was incomplete they still managed to get get now in a situation where it's either going to be a first down or very close to it and Berlin for the first time we see number 32 I am hip in the backfield Nebraska storied athlete from Chapman South Carolina a walkon one of the many walkon athletes on this Nebraska team many underdogs around the country with his play last year at Nebraska and they've also put at number 95 Johnny Lewis Oklahoma has they're going into what they call their math dog defense george yardage defense they'll have four down linemen two little guards in there in less than 1 that's offensive to the middle of that Nebraska line Caulfield 5754 and one for 68 and they just pushed Nebraska back Kaitlyn honey that is physical alignment you'll find at the college level look at him look at list with 68 he just pushing him back sorely just kind of got in there and went along with a sturgeon Falcons double first down that's almost like a quarterback surf you just get in there good boy behind that line the 30yard line for yard gain Nebraska's taken the opening kickoff and has marched to the Oklahoma 30 they've used already four minutes and 15 seconds and have a second and six deep link with one of the fine guards on this Nebraska team was right on Reggie Kinlaw number 62 watch it right there as he slips inside gets position on him and then will not let it get out to use this great lateral speed as you may notice number 68 Lindquist a congenital deformity right hands very different number 38 made the hit very different by the way is the fourth linebacker Oklahoma which doesn't usually try too many tricks defensively putting some different lineups that gets this Nebraska team to try and shut the down for defensive lineman now they've got four linebackers very different an extra linebacker turn it into that lineup made to play Tom Sorley wants a timeout will visit with head coach Tom Osborne facing third and five at the 29 of the orange ball resumes and Miami Florida right after we pause for this word they aren't goal in Miami it all began this classic in 1933 when they called it the palm festival it was 33 and 34 then the first Orange Bowl in nineteen Nebraska Oklahoma in 79 and it's third and five for the Huskers at the oh you 29 surprise they get the Franklin the fullback that doesn't carry that much and he shy of the first down by yard and a half Phil Taber 74 he and his twin brother Paul members of the straight Oklahoma team made the tackle number 22 Kenny Brown comes in with a play from the sideline Tom Osborne calls all the plays himself shuffles them in with his pretend go for it course on a long was i back and watch this face everyone in the park watch the little egg around and he faked it back into the line then options it out flips it out the number 22 skinny brown and skinny easily goes by the Oklahoma defenders for the first down mark call good play now they had Oklahoma looking for the inside however they fix the power and gave it to Brown for the first down which is the 12th play of this Nebraska opening drive away as pitchman he had so lost back at the 22 as Darryl hunt number 85 Homer tackler on the year made the stop let's watch him in action Darryl hunt certainly one of the players on this team the pros are very excited about what the lateral move here reached the play wise with sorely adjust comes up and wrestled him to the ground forcing him to lose a yard on the play he's a fine athlete Rick Burns has come back into the Nebraska backfield on second and 11 and Tabor applying the pressure on sorely again they had two four linebackers in their very Ditman going in they get great pressure here on sorely and surely almost made a critical mistake almost threw it away flips it out as he was going down right there it's been getting a hand on it unable to control it third and 11 why and right is Miller the night animal rolling what a great play by Tim Fitch the guideline give you a chance to see it darling throwing it deep this happened to go up turn all the way around at 17 Basel banks actually the defender that was on him right there but a great catch able to get one foot down Billy Todd who steals old people boy over seven minutes for the first touchdown of the game tim smith his second touchdown catch of the year opens this Orange Bowl scoring the top two scoring teams in the nation and Nebraska on the board first seven nothing Billy time to kick it off Jimmy Rogers 34 do I cut to the short man number 43 50 Ray Anderson let's go back to that touchdown you'll see some great footwork by Smith who got one foot down Oklahoma has only been behind twice this year once the Nebraska and once as a result of this touchdown pass Tom Sorley to tibfib great leaping grab get back exit both feet down in the end zone even though college rules they only have to touch one foot in to mark it up for a touchdown Tellis owners what's their wishbone an act 29yard while we're waiting for the penalty call the offense for Oklahoma Thomas lied he's a quarterback but everyone feels it as it is and the wishbone he is a running back Kenny king has the best average of that starting for Billy Sims the Heisman winner and David Overstreet the other halfback with Viktor Hicks a giant tight end six three in 254 and Bobby Kimball the split end Louis Oprah is the left tackle Paul Hebert the other brother at left yard jody farthing we've got a story about him later on he's back to spring after after this fall after quitting last spring and become a valuable addition as a senior year Craig Roberts the first one the almond award and Sam clapping maybe Jack over there on the right hand side illegal procedure both sides they break the wishbone 33 yard line Sims who averaged seven point six yards a carry on the year score 20 touchdowns to lead the nation the secondary made the back of a second and six deep enter Nebraska excuse me the defense dick sure has a tough job out there stopping the wishbone Laurence Cole rod horn kenny wine master at the nose dan pencak George Anders poblet probably the best defensive go and motion comes overstreet that plot on the action so first down at the 38 yard line before Jim pillow to Geoff handsome can make the stop the word winners not only have to rub the ball dick they have to block some time so that was walking on number 96 George Andrews made that play a a winner got down to third a very American himself and here tsimmes join the block on it field right there one great after another right over the middle the line and take on board didn't still one way as Helen what the other facial measurements linebackers for Nebraska are Dunning and turn spoons are great allaround athlete defensive backs Tim Fisher whose cousin Pat there was uncle Pat actually played for the Washington Redskin for many years and he means got a tough job today he's gonna be one for Nebraska for Oklahoma all day Russell Gary is Jim chillin chillin by the ways a monster man you'll see them all over the field right now you're gonna see a punter on the field as Oklahoma failed to make the necessary yardage and a light rain begins to fall in the Orange Bowl and of course Nebraska could have prayed for that hoping to slow down some of that Oklahoma speed so the black shirt defense holds and they kick taken law of Oklahoma brings email Nebraska Oklahoma team that gave up only 14 first quarter all year muster seven Sooners nothing the Oilers and the Steelers the rubber game each team of winning at the others home field and that one to decide who goes to the Super Bowl Curt Goudy John Brodie Merlin Olsen will be there to call it for you better order some extra ambulances for that woman if it's anything like the last shootout down of Nebraska leading seven nothing all of the 25 monsters 649 left first quarter from Cincinnati Ohio 23 passes during the regular season and it's a short gain of about five coming right at you at ground level from Thomas or lease at number 22 around and watch it right here they've backed off of him gave him a little road and Kenny just turned back and took a quick pass picked up a nice gain on it it'll be second about four and a half almost five yards to go I am yep and Rick burns are in the game at the same time I've accent uh behind 33 yard line John Goodman 72 the first man to make contact in the middle of that line Kelly Saalfeld at centers working on Reggie Kinloch allamerican nose tackle nose guard for the Oklahoma team did a beautiful job of blowing him off the ball keeping him out of that place however he could keep the rest of them out of there here's a chance for you to see it at home get good position on Ken LAN then work into him that's a great blocking technique right there to find play by the veteran upon arrival Charlene doesn't like the call as he looks at that Oklahoma defense and Nebraska spends its second timeout already in this first quarter five minutes and 32 seconds remaining in this first quarter Oh a spectacular Hampton show as always in the orange ball so especially those of you adults watching the kids maybe in the other room hopefully some of the longest games in the history of the Orange Bowl and speaking of eye lights coming up in two weeks first edition OHS 1979 sports world on NBC standing and also the Muhammad Ali Invitational track and field championship from Long Beach California but some respect oh praise world of sports as January board game 3 o'clock Eastern Time Barry Switzer Dalton that is Oklahoma team that has been stroked up in the first quarter defensively is already given up a score now as I said earlier they've only been behind twice during the year once in the game they lost in Lincoln and here too in the first quarter at this one does that speak well for the defense Asha was Nebraska fan thought that I am hip had the ball but it was the fake and the toss to Miller incomplete and Nebraska's Tim Smith will go on to put it away they knew who had the ball down on the field and Oklahoma was not only on top of Lee on top of South Doorly but they were ball throws too high Miller Miller could have caught that would have sucked it away had it German a little bit lower he was open they can't get that big fat in that matru Freddie Nixon number 11 deep to return the kick by Smith no pressure Andover end fair catch at the 30 the orange poll scrapbook you're going to joy some familiar faces going back to their college years these great athletes who start in the Orange Bowl some of my president their day I'd like to see your college tuition wait there a couple years later here starting to grow you believe that that could have been his high school picture maybe it is hey that was fun that was fun great stars all played in this Orange Bowl classic Oklahoma trailing seven nothing and again they break up the bone and give it to Simms bili sounds when you've got a whole backfield full of people who can run for five or six hundreds all you got to do is isolate them get somebody to miss a tackle and you're a deep trouble damn they finally getting down he almost got stood up at the yard line out of the wishbone give it the King the first option and he plows all the way to the Nebraska 45 a gain of eight currents and Cole made the tackle the first boxer would they do that man who leads the other shoe the big fullback Kenny king is the most crucial bestop defensively on that particular play it looked like there was no option call they just handed in the Kenny king and said go get up and he just throw it on you saw the 7.9 yard average splashing that's the best of the Oklahoma backs first down for Simms at the 40 of the Huskers so at 4:25 left for the first water trailing 7 nothing Oklahoma generate Shelton trying but to the right and he mains will play him oneonone throughout the game give it to the fullback take care of as the longest run by a sooner this year 74 yards against Colorado except upon the old boomer sooner and they brought the Boomer with him over on the same side of the side ever thank their tight end in lol they're trying to detect the it first by Lee Coons number 38 Finney stopped by horn and pencak the two tackles as he gets to the 34 Nebraska and brings up a third down and four despite an athlete you see him number 38 from Golden Colorado an engineering major with many feel if he wanted to he could have been an outstanding he's won the big eight discus championship for the throat just under 200 feet this year I've taken motion give it to them the suitors are on their feet great block by Kenny King to get going with that woman Tim Fisher's not the biggest guy in the world you see right there they're flying him outside them just breaks the corner in the down field runs right over Tim Fisher number 60 Wow oh that hurts way up here and Jim Hanson offers 24 David Overstreet a sophomore from Big Sandy Texas flying 511 and 192 it's interesting the sizes of a4 starting back they're all about 511 and all about 200 pounds they're all capable of taking or Scott was right here that helmet just flies off Overstreet head yard line very white master regarde baby stop is way pause briefly for station identification from Miami this is the NBC television network this is km TV in Omaha the Orange Bowl Miami a minute and a half left in the first quarter 7 nothing Nebraska but Oklahoma on a drive there at the 15 of the Huskers third and one robert's the Outland Trophy winner top lineman in america and sam claflin a fullblooded Cherokee number 63 the right they play for this Oklahoma team they lined up in the wishbone but they just ran a power play fullback diving up in there and then following him in diving for the first down stems with 42 yards in this first quarter this time Lewis over age 66 the left tackle and whole Tabor 73 to left guard opening the whole shock to land the man stands the defensive coordinator for Nebraska he said as much as we appreciate his talent Kenny King is all about the tougher back for us to handle hi formation they're giving the graph to some of their own medicine here second at the long three at the 4yard line Jeff Hanson up from a safety spot to make the hip ball tabor we told you about his identical twin brother Phil number 74 our defense ball Tabor leading the way for Simms going to be close but not close enough for a measurement third and and Nebraska was number two in the nation and story Nebraska the number one offensive team in yardage Oklahoma number two ladies shuttled in by eleven Freddy Dixon it appeared Nebraska was offside come on the defensive left side of a red shirted line seemed to pop offside watch the far side over there starting across justice quickly and jody farthing number 53 did what a smart center always does snaps the ball taught him how the position of farthing as they stamped the ball almost as if he's being shot ahead just level to the ground as though his blood this story is a good one he was a fifth quarter see here was not going to play until wallpaper broke a fan had to come back and finish the season actually came back job a lot of input favorite guard first and goal here tonight to the big performance against the arch rivals Nebraska two long drives 13 plays for Oklahoma the kick and with seven seconds left in the first quarter oh that's a rash of sevens up there Nebraska has seven the Sooners has have seven and back quickly to look at them what a great play watch it now as they opt it off first first option there King lifts it out Sims who just uses his great speed and a little bit of a move there at the end goes past a five block on the outside by Kimball and waltzes into the end zone now Oklahoma will kick it off to Nebraska 77 as we come to the close of this first quarter 69 yards for the Sooners Nebraska used 14 plays in driving 80 yards for their touchdown watching bonchama warmup terribly impressed with the strength of his leg dick he was kicking those field goals from beyond 50 yards and his kick off the first one failed five yards into the end zone anybody does with this one and you'll notice he's kicking off from about the thirty nine and a half that's because otherwise he'd be offside when he kicks it very deep locket will kneel and take the touchback of the 2000 with seven seconds left no time expiring on the kick it's Nebraska from the Husker 20yard line no way Sooners have answered the opening seven points the Cornhuskers now let's see what Nebraska's offensive team can do interesting on that drive they spent quite a bit of time out of the wishbone throwing some wrinkles tonight at Nebraska some iformation some motion Galen Hall at the Barry Switzer decided they're not just going to get out there and run out of that lock at number 82 the right on the right side and she have planned another tight end anchor on the left side I am him for the 24 as the first quarter comes to an end here in Miami Florida the 45th mortgage Fall Classic is tied at 7 we'll have a second quarter of action after these messages from Miami's Orange Bowl check the bow the pilot al come on shooting those great pictures from over we open the second quarter dick Hamburg with Merlin Olsen wishing you a Happy New Year 1979 from the Orange Bowl a 717 second in six Nebraska 26 maybe the 27 very different catching him in midair one of the most difficult things to do against an Oklahoma defense is to get outside great team speed that's great for suits that you just have a hard time outrunning them you get out to that corner and there are three or four of them out there waiting for you we should comment while it appeared in taking the long shot of the blimp that was raining very hard it is not it's a light rain falling let's his eyes he has a man open on the sidelines he was going to make go gone sure Nebraska man didn't catch it maybe is 38 you see the way you handle that ball what sir graduated from the University of Arkansas 59 they'd like to work the junior miller inside but they also like to work down the sideline and they just threw that one a little bit wise a little bit behind the receiver boys they're all ray and Freddie Nixon our Dave Smith a wobbly kick ray fair catch bubble and falls on it at the 34 Oklahoma has the football early in the second quarter less than a minute gone at the second forehead the Husker seven this Sooners 77 tie early in the second quarter is Tom Osborne talks to that offensive line the ball at the 30 for the Sooners is Thomas block moves under center Cody farthing one of the fishers to play at the University of Nebraska watch right now little fake on the backside on the options drops back and very uncharacteristically goes deep Kimble down there ball slightly under thrown and Fisher did a great job of spreading to that football and knocking away Pat Fisher's allpro Redskins and Tim's father Cletus is the offensive line coach for Nebraska the only through two passes in the other game that they played against Nebraska we follow straight cruet Joe Washington Elvis peacock horse ivory hold Oklahoma Sooners I've had some great running back part last week and I know you enjoyed the basketball action Notre Dame Kentucky and all the football activity and then how the Bob pork desert classic what a way to begin the golfing year that's the 13th and 14th two weeks hence from the beautiful desert area Palm Springs Paul our good friend John wants to throw a football though he hangs on to it and fights forward to the 35 yard line Joyce hit a leg power of lot he took three or four shots from a big defensive lineman for the Huskers stayed on his feet short of the first down it'll be fourth down in ten George Andrews in from the back side for the Cornhuskers run right over the top of what looked like Tarkington as he ducked underneath and then just tried to bowl his way out of there they finally got him on the ground jerel ray is gonna kick it away for the Oklahoma Sooners Lockett and brown are deep for Nebraska no fair catch and the sooner is surrounded at the 31 yard line of Nebraska twelve and a half minutes remaining in this first half which Turner's seminars for the Huskers 7 pitch shot because at halftime folks you're going to see the spectacular of lights disco don't go away very special show at the intermission one of the spectacular of this Orange Bowl first down Nebraska 77 times what with a half minutes remaining first half wallet the 31 Darlene eats it himself and gets out here the 40 before Phil Tabor can track him down Charlie doesn't run all that much saw the opening and took the Artie's it'll be second down in three very Street looking play with other scores in the cotton Houston was ahead 34 to 12 and Dan Devine Cyrus came from behind to win in the final seconds 35 34 great defensive battle the Sugar Bowl Alabama wins at 147 and you saw another fine defensive struggle at the USC in controversy beat Michigan 1710 at high leg style of Calvin Hill a great Yale University star still playing well in the it certainly does boy he knows how to go after that extra piece of yardage it's that whole so quickly he's about a four six four five back himself looks like he's got some Filipino or it's like what is he have another Filipino and Rick's of course playing for the heavy heart all season long his mother passed away just at the start of the season first down Nebraska on a little counter Franklin Anniston Alabama for six feet and a whale of a blocker picked up three we saw the scores of other games Berlin I think it's more than appropriate that we comment on who's going to be number one Alabama beats Penn State so Penn State no longer undefeated but USC winning again today feat Alabama at Alabama earlier this year at Oklahoma only three yards away from an unbeaten year well I think we have to give Oklahoma a chance to see what they do at this one and then maybe we could talk seriously about a toward the end of the game yes there was locket my pressure sorely month coming in on a blitz number 85 watch it steps up drives right up the middle here not the first pump was going to be in it continued on in to take sorely to the ground certainly the pressure making him throw the ball a little too deep for receiver had no chance that it all America Darryl hunt now down seven soleus three out of seven now 54 yards rolling and get the Brad at Oklahoma 33 star they doing a great job of staying on his receiver and then throwing the ball in a place where it could be intercepted but where Tim Tim Smith could reach back Corral at football pick up a very big first down Smith was the number three receiver for the Cornhuskers with 19 on the season two big ones in this one tonight away by Darrell way number three Ray basil banks didn't know where the ball was and I think they've called a penalty a number 58 Reggie Mathis as he continued it on sorely after that ball was shown you see some very concerned Oklahoma Sooners there yes indeed they call roughing the passer first row foul 15 yards that'll March that ball all the way down to about the 70 sometimes it appears those officials walk forever doesn't here's what the family was for he watched Reggie Method go in at the end of the play door they willing away now ball clearly gone just to the right side of your picture we could see it up here 17yard line of reverse to call a clip against Nebraska lockers peeling back to help not get his head in front of the right there particular Penley as you watch the play develop here watch Lockett drinking to the outside just on the left side of your picture 58 right there the man who has committed the foul earlier he was the man clips on that play the ball will be marched back now and it's going to be first in about 25 yards to go exactly at the point where madness picked up little rustling fall at the 33 of Oklahoma in minutes and 46 seconds left in this first and I wonder if madness field any better about them now I'm sure he didn't join me but at least the ball goes back there's a man who's not very happy about it he doesn't get animated very easily actually they penalty marked off from the spot of the foul which was we named the lioness remaining so it's a 23 yard penalty first down for sneak Franklin through the light on an obvious passing situation the Oklahoma defense just would bite shut him down quickly one of the differences between these two teams is that Nebraska does have a relatively sound passing attack Oklahoma throws the ball very little and has not had great sex great success throwing the football and he's out at the 28th of Oklahoma down by Darryl hunt number 85 making tackle after tackle Kumbi over there the two linebackers showing you some great speed as they caught up with Franklin smart play though they stretched everybody out making it look like they were going to go deep and then through underneath to the back Andre Franklin coming down by the way it's not early is five for ten now in 83 yards passing third and 20 and for a mom Billy Todd the senior from Chandler Arizona his longest this year is 48 yards longest ever 55 this one will be spotted from a brown the 33 of 43 yards M 44 yard attempt by the left corner Billy Tom our 1279 Oh Sunday January 14 three o'clock Eastern Time here on NBC is we start a whole new year and some exciting sports events for you as we get ourselves ready for 1980 the Olympics in Moscow he came than half of the Nebraska team to bring him down he fumbled was it after the whistle it was at the 34 yard line thus far no fumbles in the game the first of Ajanta the monster man gets ahold of him here tries to get it down keeps him hanging there now they're going after the football that's Kenny king the big fullback even tougher to gun down he's across the 40 for a first time in Miami the Oklahoma and the Nebraska teams visited a nuclear destroyer and they were all startled when the captain announced welcome to the USS sim is SEM mes but the Nebraska team want to leave right then David named the nuclear destroyer Junior in emotion played it beautifully but coaches is very impressed with its range of George Andrews and his blank ability defensive captain for the Cornhuskers just had a great year gone out there very quickly and made a great open field tackle if you can't tack on the open field you don't have a chance against Oklahoma certain second and a long nine a king's rhyme the left side of the line gets short yardage to the 44 and that'll be third down and six for most teams of 36 is a passing situation the Sooners are so confident in their offensive setup but that's still a running situation for them very often they're not afraid to go with their wishbone or go with one of their running plays in this kind of a situation miss Oklahoma six and three Nebraska is foreign to in the or break the wishbone and right isotropy the block of Greg Robert 65 look at it right there great job now watch into the open field that's felons they watch their mana finally gets hit by the shoestring but doc bellies gave that first down whatever you are another quick look at it right look at that block on Tim Fisher oh that hurts up here that is a definite mismatch now it's why roost ends up being all the football Jeff Hanson doing a good job of reacting but that was actually Andy got away from he bro Dallas Texas shoulder in terrine against the Longhorns in the Texas game this owners who played at Nebraska you watch Locke he had the size of the option if he wanted it that's just like the he is he said hey I can take this on it myself and I don't have to worry about throwing the ball at all he knows the way that's the tenth touchdown of the year Bruin Java's extra points right more teams are picking up some people say that water is not a good cast throw that fill watch him here not a perfect spiral on target and it's supposed to duck down now you go for Zumba sack two weeks from now Bob Hope Desert Classic here on NBC Thomas lot camps a 73yard touchdown drive seven plays for the Sooners to take the lead 14 to 7 3 yards sweet pilot deep to return Rick burns Frank locket as Vaughn shaman kicks it off very high and very short junior Miller is going to take it at the 25 down at the 30 just as he was breaking into the open he's hit down at the 36 yard line well you just saw a 28 yard pass from lot to Steve Rhoads here's the longest pass in Orange Bowl history as we go back to 1951 Miami against Clemson to the 51 classic Bob Steinbeck of the Hurricanes to head loose and Miami goes 72 yards are the longest pass play in this classics history will be visiting some other moments some nostalgia from the Orange Bowl burn a little flea flicker to surly but know it open honey finally throws there is an ad lib pass pattern about ever seen one the man that sorely wanted the throat you didn't get open watch it here now versus and the back didn't even say addressed himself to toss it now watch it get away from saver right there has a lot of the power to throw it Marley hunt on top of it and lock it did a great job of slipping back inside to catch that football just out of sight of your picture there McClosky was having do hole up the middle and he dives to the 37 to say he wanted for someone tripped him up it appeared to be Julie let's go back to that gift and look like now and that's the gentle kick that was get so high practices with these special teams they try and kick it to the side of the field against the wind to force a fair catch unfortunately junior Miller would have no part of that fair catch the skin looked like a pig belly Simms coming out of there a lot of people forget you can fair catch at kickoff 51 burns again Oh is he a rocket back he has a fee I believe Khosla first out he's at the 31 I have to measure on this one Jeff Hansen and making the tackle you recall on the play were wrotes nearly scored on the pass play hits have made the tackle e suffered an eye injury and it's requiring stitches we do not know if you'll return for Nebraska now this is the kind of pattern that Nebraska established at the game that they wanted Lincoln going right up the center there's a senior from Sacramento California he was the man who made the tackle of Billy Simpson forced a photo at the 3 yard line would have appeared Oklahoma would go into store and might beat Nebraska back into them there burns again and this time no hole it's only a yard George come be lucky the whole the linebacker usually see a linebacker wearing that 28 that's where he plays they strong side six feet tall at 205 from Norman Texas he was the big 8 defensive play of the year last year as a sophomore now I talked to him earlier that Walker certainly has the statistics and the ability to be a free safety or strong safety preferably strong today in the NFL me watch the back facial banks number 17 came up to submarine the blocker and burns just a great play and playing out there on the outside Finch cornerback even in college is a tough job you're playing against some quick receivers and you also have to be willing to come up and sacrifice your body hey still banks did just that threw himself right into the middle of it took down the interference and the back Vick play 14 to 7 Oklahoma sorely basin the old Franklin our starter the first time they gave the yards on that play has come Viet hunt the two outside linebackers teamed up on the tackle at the 28 mega the 29 what I'm gonna do here usually you get a pass into that territory you can be assured some yardage but the reactions of combi and Hunt were just so quick that there was just nothing there Charlie holding for Billy Todd 36 shot attempt fiftythree 2:53 left in the half Oklahoma leading 14 to 7 and the Sooners have the ball they're going back to the air and a lot lips his way to the 36 yard line Louis aubray 66 the lefthalf tackle helping lot with a fine life George Angeles made the stop for Nebraska the United States Olympic Committee will receive the net proceeds from a national commercial scheduled in this program under an agreement made with NBC for the broadcast of the United States Olympic Trials NBC acknowledges the cooperation of the Orange Bowl committee and helping to broadcast that commercial announcement second down five Oklahoma holding yes Helen Aled interference against killing very uncharacteristic for Oklahoma dick they're throwing the ball around here like they were a passing team as we said earlier they mm at 17 we have thrown quite a few here and throw successfully Jim Phil and of course saw that he might be in trouble if that ball was complete over his head said hey I'd rather have the penalty than the reception just grabbed him and hosted telling a very bright lad of a student and free veterinary medicine there that was six points if he detonated first down at the 46 of Nebraska Kelly says Braska shows a twitter lateral pursuit Russell Gary number nine a sophomore from Minneapolis Minnesota came up from a safety spot he's subbing for the injured Jeff Hanson to lead the charge of the defensive team of Nebraska and they proudly call themselves the black shirt that's what they were in practice I do wear those black shirts and boy they were a hustling out to the outside the market good defense good pursuit good hustle there were six in the men on it second and 11 laughs and they forced him inside for short yardage to the Nebraska 43 George Andrews made the tackle Jody farthing 53 with a key block and Barry Switzer checks the clock 118 now left in the first half lock Israeli 514 to 7 Oklahoma leaves Nebraska loosens its deep secondary on third and seven the open field and he's close to a first down at the 36 yard line 46 seconds in the clock is running now time called by the official with 42 seconds down on the field we were staying with the action in the middle of the offensive line number 65 Greg Roberts tries to pick up wine master carry wine after 51 only gets a piece of it although he's too hood the best he can to drive it by lot steps up beyond the pressure and then becomes a running back does a good job of getting a little extra yardage here that's Dunning 40 finally coming over the back side puts him on the ground about a half a yard short interesting decision here for Barry Switzer dick at halftime we invite you to stay with us here at the Orange Bowl and we're excited about the brilliant show that they have worked so hard to present to you and all the fans here at the classic it's a spectacle of lights and even the fans will be participating Ricky Ray Anderson has come into the Oklahoma backfield and some of the fun of that halftime show Jenny Nathanson special producer just for the halftime festivities will be looking from way up the camera high the sky high that should be an interesting perspective of that super halftime last year I was here for the game and it was brilliant if it's better than that fourth and one and luck ever anyone Lawrence Cole was in there and he had plenty of early help 96 George Andrews blitzing in superb defensive play watch him here as they just answering it's going to be an option Lawrence Cole right underneath there and from the backside number 96 Andrews puts him on the ground so Nebraska with 37 seconds left has time to possibly move down into field goal range wall at the 37 Charlene as luck at the speedster wide to the bottom here picture he's throwing for locket who was pushed out of bounds on alley cold Chuck and could not get back in bounds wouldn't have counted Hattie well there is no 5yard rule and college ball as long as the man is in front of you and in position to block you you you can go ahead and give him a Chuck can't hang on to it and once he goes by you you've got to be careful it's like the old pro rule but on that particular play he was out of bounds he had it had no chance 33 seconds left for Nebraska's second and 10 of Cornhuskers trail Oklahoma 14 to 7 it's been a good first hand those that out of the field of play is headed for Kim Smith number 84 ready for his past where was very Switzer on that one it caught the last one hope was throwing over to the sideline that way so it's third and ten for Nebraska I'm going to guess they go to junior Miller this time the tight end they're 89 well Tom Osburn over there said to play in with Lockett I've heard one of the few head coaches of the major college teams that still does a great deal of the offense in coaching himself another tietennis to the right they're gonna run with burns first down at the 43 yard line they move the yardstick shall we call Nebraska used to timeouts back in the first order so they have only one left they only have 21 seconds left that was a fine play good execution Josh the Oklahoma defense by surprise you see it right there burns showing his great speed down the sideline black running 17 16 15 seconds 14 31 Maurice Maloney a speedy freshman is in there charlie made the defensive play for Oklahoma almost shut the door on an opportunity to get some points unless they can hang something up deep or possibly get a penalty and then go for a field goal with only one timeout at only seven seconds afraid they're not much hope of getting any more points in this quarter the handsome twin Phil Taber last time I've spent by Nebraska could be the last play of this first half Miller 89 on the bottom of the screen the tight end left right his locket look out deep they played their secondary of their linebackers three men up are they going for it on at the 40yard line if it's against so that is the layout layer the first half the intermission and a great show coming up for you first 30 minutes reads out of 14 that brass this happened OMA maybe that's one of the most exciting things for for Coach Switzer the fact that that young man is a junior has got another year to play and if he gets much better gonna be hard to keep him away from that to trophy for a second time Braska kicks it off 30 yard Oklahoma spun on the first play of the second half costas owners 5 although a fumble and if aim for victor hex tied in got a little extra jump 5yard penalty you see the two men that came into the Oklahoma huddle together 24 Steve Rhoades and 6 Thomas lut they hooked up on a key pass play and set up an Oklahoma touchdown Cortinas heavens Kenny Kenny Matt Mike shop thank right first option you've got a control Allah knows man watch Jody farthing there get wine master hook keep him away King blows through the whole is into the secondary before he is that even has a chance sixtythree clapping down there to throw a block in front of it that's fine play now lock goes to the air and the George Flinn wat able to hit on it there here comes Thomas watch reverse spins out of there gets a block right there from Overstreet you get a good luck on the inside as he just turns on that great speed breaks away a couple of good blocks watching down to the righthand corner of your screen there couple of other suitors down there making room for him big offensive play 12 yard line Billy Sims is explosive offense from the Oklahoma Sooners not waste any time at all to fix big plays watch sincere takes it at just using this feed gets around the corner Russell Gary number nine came over but good play contacted so simple was into the end zone and that's a happy young man 70yard six plays full of on shaman in a minute and a half took only six plays the capper 11 yards by Billy Sims a fair catch he's just over talking to Bobby Proctor on the sidelines let's see if he does in fact go to that or if he kicks it away went blind quite hard what surprised me to see him do it they can have the 25 Johnson breaks it up field to the 36 yard line Frank Johnson with a return well you saw a 38 to run guard run by lot here's the longest run in Orange Bowl history Larry Smith the Florida game in the 67 game from his own four yard line think of the cinco's 94 yards for a touchdown Florida against Georgia Tech Larry Smith your whole team a the Rams running back for Los Angeles like the lure out of the league define Nebraska's currently by two touchdowns you've got to put that variety I don't believe that's I got that from the Nebraska Pam bugeaters wreck burn yardage after the whistle person Charlie from his own 47 overshoots at intercept away and returns it all the way to the Nebraska 27 mr. past far better too and there always shows you why right here not only intercepted it but did a great job here at the sideline 27 yard line first exam for the Oklahoma to turn the ball over but they didn't want rain they thought that would hurt Oklahoma let's say King King emotion snow blowing back to the line of scrimmage third and they play King breaks a tackle look like a little bit of a mixup of the factory Kenny king took advantage of it he comes in right here bumps into a lot i watch what happens King breaks it back against the grain and then he points to one of his blocker Cirie said you get that guy and I'll go further just see him right there straight arming Andy mains and be able to knock him down but he picked up a couple extra yards and across 217 Oklahoma Lee Sims and again that is hard block keeps it still on his feet they finally Pentium it and six from the seven yard line see the third down conversion syrup while Houma hitting 50% on the day let's see how they do on this one if they can get this one day from the eye sims running through tacklers to the four seed linemen because they usually don't get the publicity that are it is spread around among defensive lineman of course it evens in linemen don't get enough either I can tell you that right now too much time taken by Oklahoma so the pie SOTA sleepover shifted a man now now they have their balance right down the middle raise interception develops into three more sooner points and with nine minutes left in the third quarter oklahoma 24 Braska 7 dick and they get it again it's Johnson at the 26 they run it back to the left again and he gallops out to the 42 and they're getting broke the Pittsburgh Steelers the winners competed in the Super Bowl in January little flanker screen Kenny Brown gets a block and sports out to the 40 bacon a throw complete at the 35 Franklin and hip behind sorely I am hip quickly by the defensive team kept trying right tackle male gains ik awaits third and five kept being one of those that boat a he's from Miami fourth and five Nebraska goes for it at the sooner thirty Charlie position of straight quarterbacking at Nebraska he says it himself he said I've got the greatest passer in the world nor the greatest runner but I can get the job done for you he does it right there fine past right on the money to temp Brown baby are they for a first Miller shifts right brown em tight left and this okay left the field under its own power don't forget on so first Sunday Saturday night he before the Super Bowl game a special Super Bowl Saturday night from 9:00 to 11:00 Eastern Standard Time so if your old buddies will be featured and Fred Rio the Rams will do a little disco dancing along with some other athletes mortar free pass the Cornhuskers can do with that oklahoma visa now they're critical tall charlie takes it inside the coat era with fourth and two from the oklahoma nine for Nebraska answer all he's going to use a second time out that's frustrating and Tom Osborne a rare show of emotion they didn't have enough players on the field number 80 Frank Crockett comes in to make an 11 man squad Oklahoma's tough enough to beat with 11 there goes the fiveyard penalty I guess they didn't take the time out maybe they stole away no Osborn to say hey we took the time out how can you give us five but apparently the referee did not acknowledge the timeout dan Faulkner man in charge I was born a little upset perhaps a little spoke about it he said el that's it now Wilkinson did Todd send in the field goal team and try and salvage the three points but he did not want the three he wanted the seventh he wanted to go for it still being a 31yard attempt apparently Todd is missed from 44 and 46 yards bad snap good spot by sorely and the kick is gone we just heard of wooing it's not permissible to call two consecutive timeouts on the same play therefore the delay of penalty or the late penalty was assessed against the Nebraska team that means though that they have not given up that other timeout so at 4:24 left in the third quarter Nebraska gets three but the Oklahoma Sooners lead by a pair of touchdowns next Saturday basketball NBC thirtyfour Jimmy run number 81 mr. carton esker we understand can bounce our director was also a Nebraska man confirms what you said when he was going to school they were the bug eaters well you see I wasn't pulling your leg at all while we're talking about get bouts pass along just hard thanks for what a great job they're doing down on the truck of bringing those great pictures too it makes our job so pleasant when they're so much a part of the action Mike Weissman down there our producer great to be a part of a team that can give us the kind of performance that we've had during the year they could put a real pleasure for us I know you especially can appreciate that team concept since this will be it for the four of us for the football year it's been a great season we thank the guys that worked so closely with us and we with them that was a personal foul Nebraska for a late hits Oklahoma has it first down at the 40 yard line leading 24 to 10 and here comes Billy Sam's 15 Jim Coan gets him out of bounds at the 32 years that's off the ball looks like everyone else is slow berries Lauren the tackle Sims pops through into the opening right there on his own down the sideline great blocking great carry Billy Sims joins the hundredyard Club in this Orange Bowl classic or anything he wasn't going to acknowledge that sideline white stripe 117 yards for Sims who carried for over 1700 yards this season 20 touchdowns he averaged average 260 yards again how many 200 yard games did he three in a row that was a new big record boy I'll tell you now he showed us why here today and and the explosive offense of this Oklahoma center team exploding again down to the 32 yard line let's see what they can do with it now yep answered 48 back on the game for Nebraska no Thomas lock keeps the book and nanny picked up four big yard second and six Billy Sims trying to get outside loves to run to us right behind it from the same team before this year before he said I know the answer to that one all right Braska I don't know the year but it was Johnny Rodgers and rich lover rich clubber 1972 yes simply write these two teams represent the only times that I spent and Island have gone to two members of the same team meanwhile Nebraska black shirts trying to close the door in Oklahoma I admire I admire the kind of work they do third alltime in Texas history Billy Sims was second overstreet all those horrible lawyers gone in with Viktor Hicks what all the way to the that's so imbalanced at the end of the first half but it has sure gone oklahoma's way here in the second half of this game temple is wired right big play that was a 2.5 difficulty I was like position wasn't it jackknifed I think about 6 feet up watch it for yourselves ground level gives the ball back to Overstreet Sims and Overstreet right in front of him Sims up just a jackknife right there and they just bury a pointed toward the ground it's a not this time but even look good coming straight down didn't it yes egg graceful third and goal at the 2 Nebraska takes in laughs the king no he keeps it and stores it and berries whatsoever locate that scoreboard and the way this game has suddenly become onesided they certainly have a case for that day what a second of concerns with 9 touchdowns really serves at 20 babies scored up here tonight and suddenly Oklahoma 30 Nebraska 10 let's get bark lucky 450 to the center of pop here all he does for this team is snap but he puts it right on the money gives that threeman team 4minute drives 60 yards and Tim plays nothing cheap about any of the Oklahoma touchdowns they've all been from 60 yards or more and engineered by this man's senior Thomas luck we've talked about the Super Bowl the playoffs basketball we've got more for you how about the US Olympic Invitational track and field meet that's coming up on Super Bowl Eve 11:30 Eastern Time one of the featured performers will be high kick again little deeper this time taken by Kenny Brown for 23 with an assistant Willie Wright yeah there they are Roberts Overstreet Jody farthing 20 Sims they have really had a second half here in the article the or septic Haven many left in position ten seconds left in the third quarter Rick burns with a flat fourth and fifth team players in there and this is a team almost big enough to have for spicy tendency is to allow a few points on the board but the characteristic strength of this team there's that great running attack and a great explosiveness Nebraska hurt by penalties in the first half and nearly a 100 yards for them you saw it's burns in motion flags down charlie Jefferson Coahoma skiing votes for number one leading 31 to ten teen in their entirety 30 minutes after the conclusion of our football coverage over most of these stations except for the mountain and Pacific stations and that will be regular time for you of course quick passes early in the game what a great looking athlete he is watch him here that ball sails over the top of the defender he's up got ahold of it he wanted to get a few extra yards on top of that third and three both burns and hip behind sorely I am squirting forth while homas rushing yardage they had 128 yards in the first half 149 in the third quarter and you look at the total stats 324 for Oklahoma 273 from Nebraska time of possession well that's his shocker right there Nebraska actually had the ball longer than Oklahoma but it's Oklahoma 31 Nebraska 10 his hip takes the pitch protection pay the price 9:32 it burns he taking ten with 12 minutes left in the game yes sorely and he is going to throw the fresco on the top six Bern's leaping through a hole one he's got a lot of fight in him off us if if it's done on the basis of performance today Oklahoma certainly should have a good shot at some calls from the Longhorn fans they to you guys those asked professor quick all the answers now come on did they tell us who they were well I think they're fine young talent they've been a great help to us I am hips Tim Smith split wide left Brown in the slot and hip up the metal dog a reverse to brown Holloway Ric burns the I back that dog defense him for the sinners its burns the quick lateral movement and the acceleration as he spots bird coming in and takes him one on one at the line of scrimmage and drives him back into the stack that's great defensive play top tackler for the Sooners had 145 85 of them solo hits this year third and a long one it's burns again and he drags 62 Texas a senior you can bet some of the professional scouts have their eyes on that young man and he has the first and goal for the Cornhuskers outside the one of Oklahoma that little blue foot on the back lockets helmet it's a follow me to Miami sticker yeah we bought up the spirit yes we're certainly hoping that all our fans across the country are going to follow us all the way to the Superbowl air of Miami on the 21st of January birds earned it there's 90 rushing is a texture crowd level watch out birds might jump right into your living room here as he goes up over the top and into the end zone great leaping dive switch points let's see if they can add the seven that was a most impressive prize by Nebraska 72 yards in 14 plays but all the time consuming that clock nearly six minutes goat it through by time and a whistle sound flag on the play illegal procedure Oklahoma so the kick is good and we have a timeout annaleigh against Oklahoma from Lee 45 yard line Todd will kick it off and you have to guess trailing by two touchdowns Nebraska Lee's going to entertain an onside kick in Oklahoma's ready for it one two three five nine men have found the 32 for the Sooners here they come they're going to kick it on side right here lining up for it all the players coming to this side let's see what Todd can do with it overloads itself and here comes they're all ray so they got that safety man in there with a good hands and he picks it off the Orange Bowl record with 205 yards and the race of Max went on to upset Oklahoma in any hopes needs eternal on to the ball but sit get to the outside wraps around gets a penis in Sims but Sims are so slow for Coach Osborne very quick that makes the pollsters look at scores it's really tough sure people are crying and Alan the Croton fans and Oklahoma fans would all say we're number one in unison but that will be decided at the ballot box early this week Nebraska has shown that they were not going to quit they cut back is over this 1970 they showed us plenty of scoring decision sooner 3124 dick hamper for the most of

  "transcript": "ABC Sports presents NCAA college football today from Pitt Stadium in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania an Eastern rivalry that dates back to 1916 the Syracuse Orangemen against the Pittsburgh Panthers this ABC Sports exclusive is brought to you by Goodyear tiempo the all season radio and eliminates winter tire changeover by chevrolet who invites you to come see all the new 1980 Chevrolet's at your chevy dealers and buy the minolta xt one the easy to use automatic 35 millimeter reflex camera the automatic choice for action photography it is a scintillating day the temperature in the high 40s but the sun shining brightly on the sky good matchup the Pittsburgh Panthers at home it's their final home game of the season by the way against the Syracuse Orangemen who play all of their games on the road because their new stadium is under construction hello again everybody Al Michaels joined today by Frank Broyles and frankly we talked about the offensive Syracuse the defense of Fitchburg superior to his win today would it be 50 points on the board or better defense well I think course they'd like to have a much better defense but since their defense had been ineffective this in itself dictates a certain strategy took call the Syracuse team they've got to keep the ball ball possession if they can accomplish this their defense is on the sideline and obviously they won't play as much and there's a technique that you use in this how do you run high possession plays you run plays and aren't wrists at high percentage I should say and short passes and keep the ball at least make one or two first downs every possession kick it if you can't score and start Pittsburgh deep on their end of the field mr. aky\u00fcz offense potent as it is we serve major test today against the pit defenses the Syracuse Orangemen so turf at MIT Stadium with a record of five and three under head coach Frank Maloney Maloney in his sixth year at the helm but the Pittsburgh defense is anchored by 99 see the Panthers winner in their opener over Kansas than a loser against North Carolina and five consecutive victories including one over unbeaten Navy last week right here 24/7 a victory led by the own freshman quarterback Danny Marino but let's talk about you Green because you're not gonna find very many offensive in the country he's only a junior and he's made allamericans YC sixfoottwo weighs 220 pounds and believe this he's the fastest player on the defensive team and he's used as kind of a big playmaker on the defense the fans will see him today and defense it right in at defenses left in at linebacker they have won a place in where they think Syracuse is going to run the football or pass so that he can be the stop calls the bad play and force a kid he is an exciting football for tobacconist what about sir accuses defensive strategy will that change anything yes there's a coach's strategy to use against the experienced quarterback give him a surprise deep as do things differently upset evil ohrid calls him to think and lose his confidence anything like this is good strategy against the price per quarterback a lot of blitzing you think a lot of blitzing a lot of changes anything to make you miss read the coverages all right so it's the Panthers of Pittsburgh the orange man of Syracuse ready for action at Pitt Stadium we'll be back with a kickoff right after this you know this how does the sign of one of America's largest most important insurance companies fireman's fine but right now we're gonna be here Pittsburgh quarterback there is Rick for Conor they are hopeful that he can play again this season he'll miss today's game obviously and probably next week's encounter and then they are hopeful that thing will be back in time for the great rivalry against Penn State December 1st the referee today is bill Parkinson work music midfield and let's listen in for the coin toss wait wait the clock is official on the field I've got a coin here a head and a tail who's gonna call this you're caught if I dropped the coin re toss call he calls tails it's a tail it's a kale and what is one the cost we receive what's Bowie the phone anyway white wins the toss it will receive take in the Syracuse Orangemen winning the toss and so we will take a look at they're very very potent offense immediately as the Panthers get set to kick off the breeze is not much of a factor a slight breeze blowing as you look at the field from right to left right now at about five miles per hour and the Pittsburgh Panthers ready to kick off they were so hopeful of a major bowl bid as far as going to a bowl such as the Fiesta and Gator and those are major bowls they would seem to be in pretty good shape right now with a record of six and one Frank I think so al if they can win these next four ballgames they will be a strong contender for any of those bowl with a quarterback like the true Cano and also Marino good running excellent defense they have a chance dropping back deep for the orange number 45 is art book they're great wide receiver and then Joe Morris the other name man as you look at fun averaging almost 25 yards per return on kickoffs and better than 13 yards on punt returns and he's flanked by Joe Morris they've traveled to kickoff for the Panthers and so here we go from Pitt Stadium with the kick angling toward the far side staying in bounds and picked up by Morris at the five and he gets out to the 13 a break for the Panthers in that the kickoff stayed in bounds it looked like it was going out offensively Bill Hurley the great option quarterback when they've got Ken Mandeville the short yardage man he scored five TVs this season we've already highlighted Joe Morris they're great back Brian ish man one wide receiver number 29 and the other Art Monk who might make some allamerica teams number 45 he also lines up from time to time as a running back right now they have him in the slot on first down from the 13 yard line and they shift into the eye with a tailback Joe Morris early after a long count spinning see that play a lot today he picks up the yard it'll be second down and I'm the men up front from right to left on the right side John McCallum there's their best lineman Frank wolf Lee the right guard in the middle a of Joe Hodges number 50 for the center Tony has an is the left guard Eastern Buffalo through Kissinger the left tackle from Parma Ohio and Tony Snyder is the tight end number 81 out of East Rochester New York we have an injured Panther Greg Meisner al they bear fine defensive left tackle seemed like he's maybe hurt his leg just a little bit so Meisner part of a great defensive line which is anchored by Hugh green as we see if their dream normally lines up as the left hand from time to time he's a linebacker or might line up over the offensive tackle Meisner is a man who just in the middle and kneeling Ricky Jackson is a good run number 87 the two linebackers pallucci and right good and then they've got Carlton Williamson at strong safety white as a firstyear star this veronik at the right corner their best defensive back is probably Joe Joe Heath number 36 so here comes my Zener as the Panthers lose a key defensive performer at least temporarily on the first scrimmage play of the game now it's very important that Syracuse make a first down because if they don't they have to punt and Pittsburgh would have excellent field position it is second down and nine the ball at the 14 yard line Syracuse lining up in the I about 50% of the time and here's Mars his first carry you can see how explosive he is out to the 22 yard line it takes no time for Joe to pick up full speed he has explosive speed now the things that Pittsburgh coaches a word about is that he runs through tackles he does not go down easily bill Hurley can put his name into the record along with only two other quarterbacks by picking up 21 yards through the air his third down and one and they give a command to go and he is punched up as he tries to get the first down at the 23yard line it looks like he's shy as bill Neal 76 was right there so they spot the ball just outside at the 23 yard line bill Parkinson says bring in the change it's going to be very close bill Neal is a outstanding football player al but he's also an electrical engineer major and a three plus student and it's a first down so the orange picking up the first and just barely with Mandeville caring for the necessary yard and just outside the 23 first and 10 sprained ankle is the official record through the bench Meisner so first I'm just outside the 23 they send monk in motion Curley on a roll as a man wide open at the 33 yard line and it's complete number 45 close to the first let's let's watch it from the endzone but as we do it's a ruleout pass and Pittsburgh had jumped into an eightman line a perfect player Bob Hurley excellent crow good concentration by muck their leading receiver receiver close to another first down and I'll bring in the change again good call al throwing old first down Pittsburgh anticipated one jumped on an 8man get deep it's the best thing against a man in motion and a flat pass good game for Syracuse early a fifth year senior herd in the opener last year as they measure and it's another first out for Syracuse Hurley heard on the seventh play of the night and then he came back and played in one more game but he came out of that one in terrible shape physically so they applied for the hardship ruling got it and they Epperly back in 1979 doing a great job the hardship rule is you can play in only two games in any of the first five football games if you do that to qualify as automatic and that was the case for hurley the rh with two straight first downs at the 34 yard line monk in motion and they give it to morris who gets it after the 39 yard line early just didn't get that play off because blanc was in motion and ran out of room he almost ran out about they used an unbalanced line for the first time and then put muck back in motion and pittsburgh adjusted their defense left a little bit Running Room over the left bar a gain of five at his second down in five Syracuse starting this drive from the 13 yard line at the 39 second down and five Lunken motion again early on a roll looking the way Ricky Jackson Brady he plays one in and then you see no green ninetynine he plays the other end the green is involved in seemingly every play and I guess of course if the coaches willing to try to run away from green they have to pick on Jackson and he was you mentioned earlier would be a star for any other football team he has great ability from Florida by the way and Green is from Mississippi they plucked you out of Natchez third down five the sole running back is Morris in this alignment with bunk split wide to the right Curley under some pressure throwing incomplete was the intended receiver beverage bottle in Thomas and so the orange will have to punt very critical play by Thomas okay a good break on the ball the receiver was open momentarily but he outran the football to deflect it and completely John White to do the punting for Syracuse Joe heat standing in his own twenty flag is down white taking in to a slight win the low kick with good distance and he fumbles the ball bouncing loose and he has to come out with it and does he is the question but remember a flag down at the line of scrimmage he did come out with it as they spot the ball inside the one but a marker down at the line of scrimmage that was a close to being a safety good graces what a tough break for Syracuse yelling go proceed for all against the RNA so it doesn't mean a thing in the life to kick again but this watch exactly what happened on this play at the kick funk was fumbled momentarily but watch him pick it up right on the goal line Jojo he's number 36 he gets he tries to get back to the 1 and I guess officials ruled that he did but the play all of them over it's all academic anyway what happened here because this burg was fair lucky oh that play they would be starting from the one foot block white is averaging 37 yards of kick and this time instead of he it's carrying white who drops back for the Panthers another low kick but again good distance white massive back up drops it picks it up at the 15 for the 20 and wait in a footrace inside the 10 touchdown Pittsburgh this looking like an absolute genius he had Heath back there and then after the penalty he puts right back there and Terry goes all the way for the touchdown and the Panthers break out on top black Schubert to attempt the extra point that is good so 2 minutes and 56 seconds into the game at 7 nothing Panthers as we see it again watch quite fumble the ball momentarily it was a low kick bear little hang time Pittsburgh has a good wall setup you could see from the theater press box is on one man the king of white had a chance to tackling he couldn't make the play Terry wife goes in for the touchdown buck to that point white had returned only two kicks all season for 14 yards 7 nothing pen few survey where the land is wild in his third years the head coach at Pittsburgh one time assistant at Arkansas under Frank Broyles and played at Alabama and coach the bear Brian we were very happy to have him on our state David trout kicking off and Syracuse will start from the 20 so a most distressing beginning for the orange it looked like they had picked pinned inside the 1 and instead it's 7 huffing Panthers coaches work all the time don't make mistakes on the kicking game now for Syracuse 8 to 1 being all side had to punt it again then they kick the ball and had their pool coverage so the orange they picked up two first downs on their first series start from the 20 early the quarterback with Mandeville and Mars the running backs on the short paddocks Joe Morris to the 24 made to stop and let's take a look at Chanukah part returned 85 yards by white sometimes when you put the defense recovers relax just a minute but he has a beautiful wall and then he used his good judgment it protected himself from the sidelines where he could cut either way Terry White number 23 an excellent return touchdown from the 24 second down and six for Syracuse hitching and fumbled and fell upon by number 47 Juarez Ricky Jackson was right there as you look Moroni in his sixth year at Syracuse under some fire because Melones had a losing record of course he took over for a legend Ben schwartzwalder was there for a quarter of a century it was one of the great coaches of all time good friend the loaning and native of Chicago went to school at Michigan and coach there under Bo Schembechler third down seven from the 23 monk goes in motion they take care of green so Hurley has some time in a little bit but only gets back to just about the line of scrimmage the 23 Jeffco Lucy made the tackle so the Pitt defense giving up just seven points seven points per game third best in the country holding Syracuse here and again it's John white back to punt interestingly we will not see white who scored the touchdown back as the deep safety again it's Jojo he threw he's tired the kick is a good one far side he lets it bounce and it goes at the 28 all right Pittsburgh with a freshman sixfoot for danny moreno the fullback Randy McMillan a JC transfer from air on rain rooster Jones he alternates with Freddy Jacobs Kenny bulls is the flanker number four and the leading receiver on the team of twenty seven catches is Ralph still 88 the split in our first look now at Dan Marino from Central Catholic High School in Pittsburgh in the shadow of the Pitt campus highly recruited decided to stay at home Marino with a long count we've got a flag but a marker thrown at the snack now I think this interesting to our fans to point out their colleges all over the nation are using motion all the Dallas Cowboys shifted their people began some confusion and unsettling situations on the defense to help the offense that time a had been T prior as you see the illiberal this is your call report by the defensive tapped in the linebacker College ran up front for the Panthers you've got Bob Gruber anchoring the left side a team member is a good one the left guard number 62 in the middle is Russ Grimm Boris is the right guard numbers seventy it is second down and 11 Moreno still getting it away Joe Oshin made the stop and I'll see the rest of the line mark made on the right side a man Benji Pryor most improved football player and the second leading receiver on the team and a man who you will see line under the 10 inch spot in slot himself and go emotion from time to time today loss of two third down 13 hit from the 25yard line 919 to go first period 7 nothing Panthers Moreno getting it away but incomplete they try to set up the screen for Jones and the pressure was applied on Moreno that time by John Kinley who came boring in number 43 that's one thing to stop an inexperienced quarterback has put a good rush Kinley was a linebacker has good speed for seven speed horse Moreno control before he was broke David trout to do the putty he's averaging 35 yards a kick slight pointed his back as long as techni season 56 yards martin monk is back to receive for syracuse calls to the fair catch and mason at the 40 yard line for syracuse its best field position of the day as they'll start this drive after a 35yard kick so the difference right now the 85 yard run back by Terry white first quarter 903 to go 7 nothing Panthers good year tiempo official Arizona State in a mustwin Acton battle with Stanford or simple Michigan Toledo and gentle Hawaii check the listings on ABC you're looking at Terry white who ran back to kick 84 yards for the touchdown they get 7 uh pink Panther's he plays the left corner defensively from pet as syracuse takes over at the 40 first and 10 market motion and Mandeville picks up two yards out to the 42 where Jeff Valusia number 51 is there to meet him Pelosi the senior from Youngstown Ohio and has had two brothers one just finished it a young brother on the Freshman team second down and let's call it seven Syracuse just inside its own 43 yard line their third offensive series Morris he's only 5 7 177 but he doesn't hesitate with that football he's been very impressive so far in his first one in fact out Pittsburgh busted their defense they moved over to the wide side of the deal and they were called very shorthanded on the weak side first down at the pit 47 yard line that's more emotion this time early looking complete down to the 33 yard line Brian ich Minh number 29 making the catch at that I was right here with him they spend his second leading receiver on the team coming NE faut 12 in the first eight games for the orange but give Hurley credit for that completion he is running to the left now tough to turn back throw sidearm it's right on the nose he now has 25 yards passing so he becomes the third man in NCAA history to rush for more than 2,000 yards and passed for more than 3000 in his career as they send Moncton motion on first down give it to Morris and he's chopped down at the 30 yard line the other quarterbacks who rushed for better than 2000 passed or more than 3000 time part in a debate between 1971 and 1973 and rick Leach at Michigan between 1975 and 1978 so early it's a elite company he certainly is good run a good passer good option quarterback second down six Syracuse at the pit 29 Morris Steve football number 58 the junior from Pittsburgh 63 249 pounder forcing him out so the boss body inside the 29 yard line third down and six Panthers leading seven nothing was 653 to go in the first quarter early his receiver phone it's intercepted by Dean yardline so another big play by white as the intended receiver bailed out but a marker is down a marker is now back at the 33 yard line roughing the passer looks like Al personal foul and that is the call and so that negates the interception Gary white had run back a kick for a touchdown then the intercepted pass but it's all nullifying here as we see it again that's watching he rolls out to the ride he had an unbalanced line protection so that he couldn't put the force on him turns back throws inside he was Ricky Jackson 87 yes let's see if we detect it right here you cannot hit the passer in the face that's what he called Jackson came down across the face that's illegal so instead of the Panthers having at his first time Syracuse from the 14 its Moorish getting down to the six a few people but get Fred into the Syracuse line al they have opened up some good Holland's for is the defense's seventh in the nation and it doesn't take Mara's long to get through those old will short legs he running faster than we looks like Joe Morris just to sophomore from air Massachusetts back to back thousand yard seasons it is second down and two for a first down and six for a touchdown this is Mandeville fighting his money forward what looks to be a first down they jumped up Pittsburgh jumped into a gamete and Hurley she'll go out of doors and he just changed the play at the line split the two guards and made the first day he needed to got about two and a half and now its first and goal at the three as they line up in a straight team and it's mandated they stopped in this time after a gain of maybe at the yard yard it's ball carrier is averaging four yards a carry coming down scores five touchdowns which tells you that they like to give it the Mandeville when they down by the goal line well he had fought back you have the best shot straight ahead to the right of the left go the shortest distance to the goal line from where the ball of is placed second and goal early on the roll is time throwing it up we've got a marker down in the end zone and it's incomplete but a flag was thrown a lot of traffic near the back line that time he can see you Green was involved in the play luck was intended receiver and if it's pass interference on the offense it's a safety if it's past interference on the defense is the first battle the oneyard line it's on the defense let's watch 81 the side of Tidy in falls down gets up see if we can detect the interference number number 48 Williamson right there leave the interferences old muck up front right number 45 first down recovered in the end zone but I think they whistled again at the one they did can you believe that oh quick whistle Mandeville was the ball carrier lost it and then you heard the whistle as Maloney looks on from the syracuse bench how do you pick that up perfectly the whistle is stops the ball regardless of well the play has stopped enough that's it watch it real quick let's see if we detect Mandeville holding on right here the ball is knocked out the whistle had blown early picks it up scopes but they whistled it dead contending he was down so a second and goal in his/her wheel dives in for the touchdown so seconds they break on the quick whistle is able to exploit it the advantage of having a quarterback that can run with the football it puts a digital burden on the defense when you get close to the goal line to have to account for the quarterback situation they did the count for him and Hurley went in for the touchdown nice Hurley's 8 TD of the season trying to tie it up Anderson has and misses season he's 23 out of 23 the fake they'll go for two Ricky Jackson is back there to tackle Jeff Fischer number eight so the orange gamble have come up short but they're within a point we have 4:35 to go in the first quarter it's Pitt se7en Syracuse ex Bruce Jenner for the monotony school activities on the other half of education but are supported by less than 1% of the school budget in most communities that's the best bargain in education the National Federation of State High School Associations urges you to support high school activities which educate boys and girls with unmatched economic efficiency Sarah Kay trailing 76 Gary Andersen to kickoff Timothy Lewis and Jojo Heath back for the Panthers Louis the 20 and to the 31yard line Lauren Barbie made the stop let's take a look at the extra point again Fisher the holder here yeah he partly the ball he what what you coach this in practice now do you homophile the port of action the kicker sinhala power pick it up receivers release and he tries to make a twocomponent diversion out of a bad snap looked initially like they might be going for two on the fake but that wasn't the case fumbling the snap and so it's 7 to 6 with Pitt having it at the 31 yard line first down Jim Collins number 33 by far the best defensive player for Syracuse made the tackle coming up next the second half of our doubleheader today most of you will see the pac10 battle from Palo Alto Stanford against Arizona State those of you in Philadelphia via satellite you'll see temple against Hawaii for Hall over second and six 36 yard line again Collins is there number 33 College is 6 to 235 he's a junior out of Mendham New Jersey he was the team's MVP last year we have him isolated I call this is the belt linebacker and his role is just to key the football and try to get in on every play he was unknown 199 involvements last year by far the leader of the team the 41 yard line is complete on the far side still 88 the receiver and we have him isolated steal the receiver sort of the first step the official could have get in his fall at base below the bowl and it would have been a first step and on forth and less than a yard jackie sherrill is not going to gamble all right monk drops back for Syracuse to receive the kick from Dave trout low snap the trout is able to get it away angles it is inside the 25 makes a good pit bounce and rolls out at the 16 three mistakes by Syracuse and a kicking game we've already talked about that was a third without don't let the ball hit the ground it will roll and roll and roll so in in an artistic punt but nonetheless a 45yard kicked when you let the ball hit the ground Syracuse from the 16 yard line we have three minutes and two seconds remaining pit leaning seven to six ich bin split wide to the left they send one wide to the right and the animal is the sole running back is puck goes in motion from the 16 they give it to Mandeville who chugs his way to the 20 refuge action at the bottom of the file number 87 Ricky Jackson number 87 let's watch him make this plays defense it in 87 just goes right through the bunker and gets involved oh man the bill the fullback number 41 for a short game second down and six the orange from the 20yard line Mei this time far as the tailback man to build the fullback it's minute motion Mandeville whistle blew before he lost it at the 31 yard line first and Syracuse Annabelle make made a good run on that play there was a trap up the middle all for the fake option Pittsburgh defense was fooled completely Syracuse a potent offense but as Moloney explains he says if we don't have a good day running we're not going to win we can pass but not well enough to be picked they have a little mixture but it's not really the type team that would really hurt a team on passing down Morris we mentioned in the pregame show they likened Morris to Archie Griffin mm small very quick very wide and he has an uncanny ability there's his stats so far nine brushes 43 yards but he has the knack of finding the soft spot all these blocking zal are open blocking option blocking run wherever he sees daylight I love that shot from our director Jim Janette Mara's got lost a lot on second down five from the 37 well he's going to keep close to the blockade line and close to a first down Steve Fidel 58 there to make the tackle as the clock ticks down toward the 1minute mark left in the first quarter one piece of strategy for the fans Syracuse are using an unbalanced line about half the time doing this purposely kooky wide not think green away from the inside plays that puts him wata gives them an extra blocker on that side for pass protection you tries to cross them up though from time to time by playing in different positions flopping a lot this time they've got green line up on the left side defensively in its Moorish 45 yard line again it's Fidel Lynn Thomas number three in on the play and so it is second down and six Syracuse gained some confidence moving the ball they are blocking the the great Pittsburgh defense and they gained your confidence Pittsburgh better watch out don't encourage a team when you the favorite and don't give them occurred early pitching to Morris cuts back inside 48 yard line Carlton Williamson running it out and the clock still running as the tackle was made and bound so that'll do it for the 1st quarter when the second quarter begins Syracuse will be at the end of one its Pitt se7en Syracuse picked up nine first down nine in the first quarter none for Pitt it's third down from the 48 yard line third about for Morris drives to schedule a free loses the ball at Pitt has it on the bumble it's white number 23 who came up with it bumble for the tax down many intercepted a pass that was negated by the penalty and he picks up the fumble recovery here let's see being attacked exactly why Morris fumbles the ball number 47 the number 58 barosky's knocks the ball loose I'm sorry Fidel the linebacker white recovers so at midfield it's a first down for the Panthers and Moreno fumbles the snap and then falls up back into 46:39 so a stuttering start today for the freshman out of Central Catholic High School 64 200 pounder as we take a look at the numbers through period one in that amazing look at the time of possession that's what pops out at 2:00 12:15 two minutes and 45 seconds the young freshman quarterback has confidence he's got to come back and have something good happen right there look at that pitch side all single digits second down 14 from the 46 Marino some time has Jones open in orange territory and he's favored at the 44 will be third dad and for upcoming as James Collins made the tackle Marino showed a lot of course that's surprising they've been the surprise team so far lake bars seven and one going into that one with the Tigers third down for Pitt seeking its initial first down Moreno gets it away it's complete to fire my hair is tangled back shy of the first down Benji had the first then went back across the 40 yard line and we'll see where they spotted he may have crossed in the first he did out absolutely a good call let's watch Jim Collins a linebacker pass responsibility his role is to drop deep as soon as he sees the past duck too tight in in front of him he breaks up and gets involved and pushes prob back short of the first down so it's fourth and one and this time he'll go for it it's across the 40 and should have it white may was the man who led the charge there were 73 from the land side and they have the first so the Iroquois defense muchmaligned yields its first first down Cameron Connor Shafer and Kinley are up front the three linebackers Collins in the middle is the big man and there's the secondary Farkle Payne is their best defensive back the free safety number 20 inside the 40 burrito protected cutting in front of balls on a crossing pattern last time and incomplete was prior they had two receivers in the scene spot fake brow got pushed a little deeper by the quarterback than he wanted to to try to get in behind him let's watch it from the end zone you'll see that marina is a straight drop back past two men out to the right crowd number 84 couldn't control it let's see what if he takes his eyes off the ball right in his hands something burned his concentration incomplete second down and ten Moreno again he's four out of six and now he's five out of seven his player is tackled 33 yard line Mike suby 48 Tigers seven more on the board seven three nothing clemson in the second grade al bit Benjy bar is hurt on that particular play prior the tightend really coming into his own this season as a junior 65 230 pound out of New Kensington Pennsylvania he and round still have done a great job as the pit receivers they were wondering who in the world was going to replace Gordon too much Jones we have a timeout with 12 19 to go on the half hit in the head 7 to 6 America what's your favorite midsize sedan and what's the thing you like best about Malibu the 1980 Malibu American it takes a lot more than Talent the light up Broadway with a show like dancin it takes insurance without insurance protection for the theater actors of audience no theater owner could risk booking a show and there'd be a lot less litter on the Great White Way where Crum and Forster working with more than 9,000 independent agents and brokers helping ensure the American Way of life amazing Sugar Ray Leonard Olympic Jeff now undefeated throw this month it goes for the big one the WBC welterweight championship on ABC banjee Pryor went down after making the catch and assisted now from the field apparently the injury that's exactly what happens 84 prior the receiver he's coming across the middle course he's hit by Collins first and then the zoo Nick the linebacker and I guess it just wanted him a little bit looks like he'll be back we'll get a report it's third down and four from the 33 yard line Jones has the first make the tackle ray rooster Jones pabulum Mississippi now the big difference in this series is the coaches head very wisely let Marino drop the ball off give him some confidence and mainly the team confidence in him about throwing the short passes gain that confidence so paint without a first down in the first quarter they picked up successive first downs first and ten from the 28 Moreno under pressure able to get it over to Jones and rooster is out of bounds at about the 25 yard good judgment al they throw in the passes and he can build his confidence a screen delays something that will make some yardage and let the players say hey this freshman is good we want him in here Marino's a marvelous athlete he was so good at baseball in fact that the Kansas City Royals made in their fourth pick in the last round on second and 7 it's Joe through the 22 yard line before thirddown upcoming ohio state underway and rollin again taking over the Illini barrel briefs has just done a great job or just a fantastic job coming into a very difficult situation this is our trail hawkins carry for the first time when the game gets to the nineteen he is shy of the first down the injury to his right they did not believe it sir is though hopefully will she make you back in the game at the tight end spot in the meantime I am Mike Dombrowski number 80 to fill again for the second time on this drive base for the fourth down situation and able to take advantage and pick up the first and each time they ran over Park maze who just happens to stand six five and weighs 280 pounds I'll never forget meeting him at the Gator Bowl game three years ago when he had to start as a freshman May is from upstate New York so one of them we've got away from Syracuse whistle sound and the flag is dropped before the snap that time obviously an offensive lineman moved before the ball is snapped another new rules you can't snap the ball you can't even if you throw yard loss out you can take the plate if an offensive linemen lose after he takes his position then the play is dead right there if you block a kick and score with it you bring it back and take the fiveyard penalty I had that happen to me one time the offensive lineman moved we blocked the kick touchdown brought it back the last five yards they bootless for ten minutes but except in the penalty was there a lot of opposition to that no I think it day is the best rule I really do first and 15 Marino this time the protection breaks down and Danny goes down at the 28 yard line John Cameron led to charge number 94 so the Syracuse defense which has been very porous this season averaging 27 points a game handling itself extremely well to this point they give him some different looks to Marino he's not quite sure where he wants to go with the football on his passes he stopped yourself you get a penalty al and you stopped yourself unless you can make the big play situation definitely favors the defense second down and 20 Marino time again but overshoots everybody and it's intercepted back into 17 Lag is dropped at the 22 yard line so the interception by Warren Pennsylvania now that maybe the new rule tackling with your head that is something that the college people put in the rule book of tackling with your head but I'm not sure I didn't see the penalty at all there are two flags though we look at a clip clip it on the run back let's watch it from the insole Marino overthrew the receiver by at least six feet let's watch it to the right of your screen receiver wasn't open there he overthrows him and Harvey makes a heck of a catch going back to his goal line let's see if we can identify the person who Clips still comes back in the left of you picked you watch the block that Harvey does not see still he's way over on the left coming into your picture Wow that's dangerous so a couple of flags apparently bold for the same infraction in the ball back to the eight yard line first down Syracuse hit leading 76 914 to go first half monkey motion facemask al yep you can see the reaction by for your FB number 68 so this will give Siragusa brain to grow eggsy March it out to the 23 yard line the facemask infraction and the orange with the first down 23 Gregg Meisner the five defensive tackle has not returned to the game out buck law was playing defensive left time Mandeville out to the 45 yard line Syracuse has stayed right with a game plan to keep the ball make some first downs high percentage plays low risk do anything but kick the ball to Pittsburgh the difference in the game for Penn that run back by we offensively they've been stymied as Syracuse is dominated in time of possession second down and eight and explores one other ball carrier in Syracuse history that would be zhanka Michigan out in felon a field goal second period leading the Badgers three nothing Michigan pulled out one last week did they last play of the ballgame a 50yard pegs they not only went to the back of the PlayBook they went to the back of the rulebook didn't even attempt the extra point very that abounds after 33 and it's Jojo he jackie sherrill saying after watching the films of syracuse it Hurley has great little regard for his own body he's the type of fella that if he needs that first down he'll give it all he's got and the consequences well don't think about it later Virginia and on top of Georgia 7nothing in the first quarter nonconference game the Bulldogs are unbeaten in the SEC Dean of a yard or so it'll be second down and nine going back to her they jackie sherrill said he had never seen a quarterback throw his body around my field Hurley does just disregard you can see that Chicano is not the only injured member of a Pittsburgh team this week second down joejoe he put the pressure on as chrisberg team with a safety blitz that time and jerry Boyarsky able to pick up the fumble at the 27 yard line you could see it coming out from up period early was looking to his right Heath was Blitzen from the opposite side and early had no idea that he was going to hit him let's watch it from the endzone Harley's roll into the right fakes let's watch it and there is he 36 strips him of the ball what an outstanding play 658 to go in the half Panthers by a point your Kmart Automotive Center is your sound shop to save $30 on this am/fm

takes the man who recovered the fumble jerry Boyarsky number 68 talk about icing up the bruise and get it up there for the whole line 21 yard line Randy McMillan stop by jim common ground level look here at McMillan has really filled a void for Pittsburgh they had a lot of problems ensuring rdik situations last year went to the JC ranks and McMillan's been a key part of their offense with 230 pounds let's watch him run the draw play synthy lowers his shoulder how much Jordan he gets after he gets hit about 3 yards that's what a fullback must do on second down they give it to McMillan again who gets inside the 20 to the 19 yard line bamboo leading Texas A&amp;M 73 in the second quarter the heart of Bob Miller to palpitate Harvard but I need 32 and Benji Pryor is back in a tight end oh all right rel Hawkins his second carry stopped at the line of scrimmage so again hit his face with a fourth down situation they had fourth and one to drive to go and cut it then on a lash dry they had to fourth that place went for both and were able to pick up the first on each occasion now they have a fourth and two they go for it on 4th the fete and then Marino throws he's been inside the number 44 Freddie Jacobson Valen his first play of the day finding the couch and getting the first down courageous call last confidence for freshmen in a freshman Moreno faked off tackle and through Lou Jacobs in the plan let's watch the feet that's what holds a linebacker you're gonna see him fake right there rolled to the lamp Jacob's thumb aborted floor is open in the flat good throw right on the numbers first down the nose of the ball is just inside the 10 so its first and goal and the pitch is juggled by Hawkins but he turns it into a small game alright well stop ball a Dean eight and a half stop ball a Dean eight and a half this is a toughest place to get a first down I used to hate to get a first down on the 10yard line that yards young run is just precious to that defense second and goal the power again for the handbags to go on the halfplane mic the brass it was there one of the two times now still would be a fearful if I were syracuse without getting some rush maybe on this the end of the field you can see that marino is going to fake and he has plenty of time to pick up the crossing in but that quick release did you see that out a quickie just rifle the ball in the dubrovsky could not hold onto couldn't control it third down and goal marino still has time Ralph still the Panthers leading receiver let's watch it on the split screen you'll see there was a safety blitz mantoman somehow Syracuse was confused no uncovered still wide open for the touchdown so still the man who took Gordon Jones is spotted wide receiver his sixth touchdown catch of the year Schubert's extra point attempt is good so the Panthers are up by 8 for 22 to go first half at the stadium it's been 14 sir to 6 good year tiempo official tire of the 1980 Winter Olympics brings you

the Panthers David trout Morrison month back for Syracuse and it's bunk at the three brawling down any gum but he went down that was the end of the play you don't have to be tackled there touchdown he went not in college football here is the touchdown and you will notice how wide open still is you'll see number three Harvey coming across trailing in but evidently had missed his assignment right there you can see number three Harvey behind in but he's way out of the play easy touchdown and Harvey was the man who intercepted the pass earlier in the quarter as you look at the man who just put six on the board for the Panthers 14 to 6 it's bird raining Sarek use in a whole again at the two yardline man to those vaults the yard or maybe to record Lucy defensive strategy here is get into a goal line defense there similar to what you would play if you backed up your own two yard line and that's what Pittsburgh is doing all eat off of right in the gaps on second down they give it to Mars if it's something they're handy Monday Night Football a good one nine o'clock Eastern Time the Houston Oilers Earl Campbell against the Miami Dolphins Bob Griese is back can you imagine a repeat of last just what I was told asleep what a game they've had last year by the most exciting game I've ever witnessed terrestrial football campbell ran wild it's time to dolphins get up at home in Miami dirty early keeping and spinning and getting to the seven yard line so the clock is running 307 306 and counting down and Syracuse will have to give it up it's going to put up a very bad field position with three minutes to to 54 left and Moreno at quarterback they can get him on oh no John like to kick slight wind in his back Jojo heating and field to receive for the Panthers a low end over end kick and he'd soon have a decent run back inside the 45 the 40 spending to the 36 to 236 and they're in good shape penalty out for up piling older than the 30 rough piled on and so that'll put Pittsburgh and even better shape the kick was 39 yards but it was a line drive the type of you can normally run back the Johnny majors in Iowa State then came here under majors when Johnny had great success then Jackie spent one season at Washington State coaching there in 1976 while majors was winning his national championship here at Pittsburgh and they took over when Johnny left for Tennessee let's see if we can't see the penalty detecting detect exactly who had washed Heath number 36 returning the punt gets caught right over on the boundary you'll see that he gets pushed out of bounds he loses his balance a little bit and can't stop and number 30 ruff comes right in basel out of bounds 20yard line Jacobs to the 11 inside the 11 might have a first down Payan rooster Jones bossy a lot of action and Jacob shaken up on the play now do you write McMillon 240pound philipot has made a big difference in the pittsburgh office in these first seven games powell runners what they had missed last year Jakob's picks up the first first down just outside the tent to the five came up to make the stop number 18 how are the Seminoles doing today Florida stayed unbeaten and leading Cincinnati seven nothing with Lehigh leading CW Post 14 nothing in the second quarter second down they can't pick up a first time without the touchdown Macmillan two colleagues 33 in on the stop a little bit ahead of schedule they had first and ten on the ten and a half and then two downs they picked up seven yards you won't three or try a minute and a half to go if they need them the Panthers have all of their timeouts left hit leading 46 Moreno and a DeBartolo involved in his first play of the day and his for six points excellent call its repeat of the touchdown before just a different receiver dan Marino has now thrown six touchdown passes this season remember today his first start because of the injury to Ficano sherbert to attempt the extra point out of scotch hole and the kick is good so they take over in great field position exploit it 1:15 to go in the half it's 21 to 6 Pittsburgh the 1980 semi Monza 2 plus 2 standard engines of gas stretching for standard transmissions for on the floor an EPA estimates sure to please the mileage is 22 mpg knees but older now there's even more 35 the highway score a good quarterback does its homework on and off the field that's probably one of the three of us are all drinking lot beer from Miller you lights got a third less carriage than the regular beer and it's less filling plus it tastes great and you know it's important to have a command of facts like that it's middle discipline really you're darn right cuz if you know every position every option and every formation you'll never get your signals crossed that's my beer turn everything you always wanted in a beer unless peel my label this fall is the second year of competition for 38 schools in the NCAA's new division one doublea football group Florida A&amp;M defeated Massachusetts for the initial championship last year and the 1979 season climaxes with the title game December 15th to be covered by ABC Wayne DeBartolo who got the touchdown to make it 21 to 6 his trap kicks off a line drive from the to ecom's accident in 1523 abandoned as we John when you faked that close to the goal line a running play you're gonna freeze everybody and you can see how wide open DeBartolo as we watch it from the ground level let's see what you do is he fakes to the tailback rolls out turns his shoulders excellent throw and good concentration by the Portola one team to go in the half and the orange have to move 76 yards getting out of bounds so at least he cites the clock loser 380 play Steve Fidel there to drive him out Michigan has increased its advantage 17 nothing over Wisconsin in the second quarter rocket yeah unbeaten scoreless with Cornell in the second longtime coach at Dartmouth then in Illinois and back to the Ivy League has done a great job this year at Cornell second and 14 early his first bottom of the day is almost intercepted but they intended receiver and back there covering was Terry white he's been all over the feet got some youngsters if we recognize this in coach you just have the ability to view around the people some of them around it others are in white Tiffany is around the football coming up following this one Stanford Arizona State most of you will see that one from Palo Alto key battle in the pac10 those of you in Philadelphia well you'll take a look at what the weather's like in Honolulu today via satellite Hawaii and temple danny moreno the freshman quarterback who's thrown two touchdown passes today on third and 14 they'll let boys try to pick up the first down and he will be considerably shy he gets back just about to the original line of scrimmage it'll be fourth and 10 now we'll see if pick decides to take a timeout on defense knowing at Syracuse he's gonna have to putt but the Panthers have not opted correction on the score Yale is leading Cornell tend to nothing clocks still running here meanwhile 2423 now pip takes its time on and the Panthers cross themselves about 20 seconds that time by electing very late to call the timeout the jackie sherrill is really upset that is kept in the summer didn't follow instructions he the parents that I could guess from reading his face this he claimed that someone to go in and call timeout immediately after the third down play that's the scarf they wasted 20 seconds as you mentioned you bet they would have had 42 or 43 seconds if they to call the timeout earlier but right now they've got 22 seconds of course the point and possible run back will eat up a few more ticks back deep George oh he standing at his own 35 and the punter John White sherek is recovering it's the putter whoa wait gets out to the 40yard line what a productive Syracuse Ricky Jackson was the man who came in johnboy locket let's watch Ricky Jackson make us superior effort right here coming from the left on the screen number 87 slow kicking the ball watch him leave his deep block it but watch the kicker white picked the ball up react just instinctively and make the first out I've never seen that I can never remember seeing this they may have found another running back the way white moved on that one eleven seconds remaining in the half and Syracuse still in possession Miami shocking Penn steam early leading by three Happy Valley is not particularly happy at the moment now Syracuse takes a timeout to figure out how you're going to move 60 yards just to recap that first quarter Syracuse I'll first a get a good job with a game playing at the head of foam blue bar the two publicist being pittsburgh opportunities like they would have had otherwise early from the 40 he's going to keep it trying to get out of bounds and dud seconds Syracuse is pass offense isn't what we would call the sophisticated where you drop back and you could pick the oak and receivers more than roll out it's difficult to him you had a long yardage to write record a hamper then the game to get to be and open because you've only got one or two receivers the quarterbacks role in that direction and you can cover this could be the final play of the half with five seconds remaining is 21 to 6 Pitt and Morris will be stopped at the 46 yard line thinking something the Panthers seeking their sixth consecutive win Saturday on the Roper Stanley starts a fire moves in with the Brooks putting Jeffries fire out for good then on detective school debate set for a killer stocking a panty Fashion Show and it's a special night on The Love Boat when the captain's past catches up with him are you gonna tell me about that I wants her daddy back then on Fantasy Island an old flame returns to stay and the boss gets his ultimate fantasy tonight well you saw these scores the correct one the Michigan 17 nothing over Wisconsin at the half so the 10th rated Wolverines in good shape and the University of Pittsburgh marching band under the direction of Don Hauer the orange to kickoff as we begin the second half it's Jojo he's number 36 back deep for the Panthers and Timothy Lewis back on the five with him as Gary Anderson takes off for the orange so in the second half underway it's 21 to 6 Pittsburgh and it's Lewis who will come out to the 10:15 and back to the 20yard line so the Panthers taking over there against this Syracuse defense John Cameron the left end that a good first half Connors is the left tackle number 83 they've got Chris Shaffer and John Kenley it right in a fourman front with three linebackers Mike zoo nakhon the outside number 48 there's their best defensive player Jim Collins 33 all over the field and Tony Siebert on the right side Moreno as we start the second half goes right to the air so balls was open had it in his hands couldn't hold it Cedric Hinton the left cornerback Warren Harvey had an interception in the first half Mike Bogosian is the strong safety and their best defensive back is that man Bob Arkell Payne 2nd down and 10 Panthers from the 20yard line roaster Jones Rainey Macmillan are the running backs Moreno they protect him well Jones $22 Dan Marino the freshman quarterback in place of the injured cercano they have Jones and the Quillen the running backs poles who dropped to pass and still who caught a touchdown pass the wide receivers with Gruber fiddler grim Boras and May up front Benjie Pryor was hurt in the first half but came back to play in the second quarter and starts the second as he incomplete three consecutive plays Moreno dropped straight back into the pocket the club will begin the second half let's watch Moreno drop back to pass the third two consecutive time first three plays of the head and you'll watch his arm up in the air when Kendall in number 43 knocks it loose incomplete not a fun Dave tried to take it away not a particularly good kick and a fair catch called for juggled and read 48 yard line by Arco Fame up front there is you green allamerica listed as the left family placed several positions Misner was heard first half Boyarsky recovered a photo of the first half they've got Bill Neal on the right side and opposite green or Ricky Jackson number 87 offensively with a legal procedure drew Kissinger was the man who jumped off as you look at Pelosi a linebacker in the middle number 51 mark Rikard the other linebacker for the Panthers and in the secondary you've got Colin Williamson the strong safety al Syracuse had lost the ability to pass and in the second quarter he goes with it you automatically lose ability to run against a good defense like Pittsburgh the Panthers yielding only 2.2 yards per rush coming into the game on 1st and 15 it's Joel Morris who gets out of bounds at about midfield Lynn Thomas was there to make sure he did not advance any further and right now Morris is closing in on Jim Brown rushing figure at Syracuse Larry Csonka is their alltime rushing leader and Morris is just three yards shy of equaling Jim Browns yardage total pretty good company second and 12 incomplete I intended receiver with a flower in Bushman number 29 the rest of the backfield for the Panthers defensively so a white who ran the kickback for the score Lynn Thomas at the right corner and Jojo heat the free safety number 36 he set up their first touchdown by the offense the second touchdown with a blitz and forced the quarterback early to fumble the ball he also inadvertently set the fire return that's another story third down and 12 from the 49 yard line he's pursuing early all right pop was the intended receiver but you've got you green bearings empathy all you want to do is get rid of the ball you run a little fast yep you definitely run fast you green number 99 we've talked about you quite a bit those of you who follow college football know that I'm gonna be several allamerica teams last year and will probably be a threetime allamerican by the time he's done John White the punt into a very light breeze and out of bounds it goes inside the 20 we'll see where they Park it they may bring it out and they do to the 21 his word went out so first down for the Panthers on their own 21 yard line now pittsburgh has had very little rushing yardage all year in the first half they rushed for 40 for 39 yards and only 39 43 passing for a total of 82 that's far below the average and yet they lead by 15 capitalizing on breaks McMillon 24 yard line it'll be second down Chris Shaffer tackle to carry over that I'm sure jackie sherrill feels like this team is getting through rely too much on the past and when you do you lose the run and then you get in serious trouble coming into the game the Panthers Clemson routing Wake Forest coming into the game Pittsburgh with more yardage passing this season then running second and seven time permitting after the game and of course we're over the second half of our doubleheader today Stanford Arizona State for most of you and for those in Philadelphia temple and Hawaii analog for stepping away from trouble and try complete Mike Dombrowski number 82 taking the cash now he showed a lot of poise he had a rush coming from his backside and some sun receivers pastors can just feel it you can see Kinlan number 43 rushing he sidesteps and very calmly rifles the ball right in good throw for the first down the Panthers at the 34 first and 10 and on a draw nothing doing Bartolo it's his first carry of the day but he's already caught a touchdown pass Florida State having problems restriction Addie they look real good last week against LSU and sometimes you have a letdown after a big way in Baton Rouge Bearcats leading by a touchdown in the second quarter second and ten Syracuse X 1152 go in the third quarter at the 26yard line it's totally number four one three we got in there the 62 206 pounds senior from western New York and he was a linebacker as I mentioned earlier with four seven speed and coming from the backside he can do damage but Allen continued on that philosophy about the run trapano is an option quarterback and Moreno is not and when you fail a run the option you can the defense can crowd you and do a good job of stopping your running game third and 17 rooster Jones next mr. job the ball carrier and the piece of punting unit to make the tackle so nothing cooking on that offensive shavers from Pittsburgh and David's out to kick it away they're starting out just like they did in the first quarter they did not make a first ban on the first play this is two possessions with the wind no first down all right muck back to receive the kick and arts gonna call for the fair catch at the 41yard the Syracuse Orangemen will start this Drive from the 41 yard line with 10 minutes and 44 seconds remaining in the third quarter in pitch Stadium it's Pittsburgh 21 Syracuse 6 Syracuse at the 41yard line first and ten 1044 to go third quarter Pitt leading by Medivh and it's Joe Morris making the tackle now since the first quarter Syracuse has done very little offense when I think the reason is that Hurley has completed two out of six passes for over 25 yards what happens is Pittsburgh defense crowds roll very difficult block Levin in close to the line of scrimmage Marsh just bashing Tim Brown and career yardage only a sophomore on second down early the big field appears to be just shy of the first down Ricky Jackson and it looks like it'll be third down and less than er one thing that we're missing is the outstanding play of new green and I think simply they are audible izing oh wait from green and running to the opposite side on most of the plays can you blame them no sir I cannot green the left side defensively this time and it looks like they may have stopped Mandeville Kenny fried to get through the middle Jeff Belushi came up there to plug the hole and we'll see where they give him forward progress they put it down at the 49 yard line and they'll bring in the chains was an excellent play by pollution Lucey number 51 let's watch him here's a dog it's a short yardage and he's gone a red shirt watch him he times it beautifully he shoots a gap watch he put his head in and the help comes up while he's got a hold of him and man the veal cannot fall forward for the extra yardage you can see Bill Hurley took a close look at that died by an inch or two and when you're down by 15 at midfield and forth that and you've got a post offense the call is easy and with a running quarterback that's an extra dimension that the defense have to account for the option for fourth down and itches Mandeville and Morris in the running backs early will keep it himself and lunges forward to pick up the first down that's the safest playing football for two inches if the center is not covered Pittsburgh was haven't even sent out two guards over the guards and there was a little Running Room a little daylight and Hurley just jump right through it in that situation if a man does line up over the center do you like to see the quarterback audible eyes yes Archie hot brother hand it to the fullback first down out of the eye from the 48 Morris racked up at 250 is the only one person can make a play like that green let's watch the tackle on the line of your screen all tackle playing green comes in and there's that arm right Wow you green from Natchez Mississippi mom died when he was a youngster raised by his aunt just the junior second and 11 Pearlie he's got some room good pulls inside the 30 of the Panthers Terry White dropping him you could see on that play that Pittsburgh was going to rush they had everybody close to the line of scrimmage and Hurley just split the guards down that's what happens sometimes when you rush the injured Panther was the man who made the tackle number 23 Terry white so we have 802 remaining in the third quarter Pittsburgh leading Sharik use 21 to 6 new kodak instant color film and the drama club a ride it maybe not let's see stay in a mustwin pac10 battle with Stanford or simple Michigan Toledo and gentle Hawaii check the listings on ABC Terry white is that a lot of good things happen today and some that have not been so good white the injured Panther and we'll see if we can he check it out there he is underneath and then some of his teammates fell across his leg and many times in my experience falling across the legs caused more than the interest and anything else meanwhile first down Syracuse from the 32 is Joe Morris tries blank over and gets for the 29 yard line Neal and Pulu si making the tackle Malusi in on the play again and we have hemline isolated let's watch his role he just spots a play he wasn't blocked and a good linebacker forces into the line of scrimmage and that's what Pulu si did but short yardage second and seven at the 29 Syracuse trailing 21 six tomorrow on the pitch and he gets to the 23 yard line and comes up gimpy let's watch what happens to a quarterback when he runs option play and you blitz ends he's going to fake to the fullback up hill and then watch Ricky Jackson hit him right there Hurley was lucky but quick hands allowed him to get the ball picks back to Morris with a nice game punished he came out of that at least in better shape and Morris but Maura stays in on third down and warm from the 23 the fake the mandevilla burly keep smash the first down get to the 16 yard line he has really taken some shots not only today but throughout his career there he is getting up slowly he just throws his body around in most quarterbacks don't do that and most coaches don't want their quarterback to do it because of the entry factor and he was injured as you mentioned early the show on the first series in this first game last year and was given a hardship and this is his fifth year playing for Syracuse first out of the 17 Morris got a half a yard report from the panther bench the defensive back Terry White with a sprained ankle incurred making a tackle and with white out of the lineup in the defensive backfield Thomas's brother I think Lin Thompson's brother Wallace Thomas is in their number nine that's right they've got both Thomas's in their litt number three and wallace thomas they call him Pepe and that'll pass the ghoul of Mississippi second down and came from the seventeen muck is in motion dives to the eight yard line so Hurley is about a yard short of the first and Miami still leads Penn State by three two lame leading Boston College jail trying to stay unbeaten and Harvard for the baseball score six to two over Brown halftime Dartmouth by seven at Princeton at Penn or tied in the second quarter as are the you and Holy Cross third Gavin one early a keeper again the flesh down and out of bounds at about the it was just perfect execution against the Blitz the corner fire and the Hurley just kept inside this watch his judgment here's a youngster in a split seconds got to decide what to do with the ball he turned right back up inside makes a nice cut big play his second big play in the series at the goal second and ten scrambling for nine yards setting up this goal line thrust first and goal Syracuse from the two for 37 to go third quarter out of the straight tip it leads 21 to 6 and Hurley what keeps perfectly the pitch and he's in for the touchdown dill Hurley that drive just about a oneman show just excellent performance by Bill Hurley the key as a coach you fully appreciate the decisions he had to scramble his receivers were covered he runs option play three times in critical situations keeps sidestep darts up and keeps the drive boiling with making yardage for the first down just a fine performance on his part it's 21 to 12 they're gonna line up for the extra point anyway what do you think Frank a fake yeah well I don't know I think they'll kick this one and then decide for a field goal opportunity and a touchdown later on the extra point would put them within E and Anderson's kick is good for 33 to go in the third quarter it's not 21 to 30 nears the TD by Hurley again from the ground hold the option play early is unaccounted for the goal line defense no one has it he just trots into the end zone for 33 to go third quarter it's pit by eight put Delta in deep flashes out forget about those washes you used to worry about don't worry free faucets ask a plumber for us Delta and LX faucets no washers no washer worries who's the symbol of good customer care mr. Goodwrench who stands for GM dealers commitment to improving service and over 6,000 participating dealerships whose face is seen nearly everywhere look for him he wants to show you he cares about you and your GM car football safety is a big concern to coaches fans and participants by using approved equipment and learning the correct blocking and tackling methods the risk of injury can be minimized the NCAA is working to prevent injuries help us be successful Jojo heat back deep along with Tim Lucas therapy Anderson Freddie the kickoff now they say go ahead Bansi dump at the 19 yard line for the Panthers who sputtered in the first quarter and have been sputtering here in the third quarter offensively we'll try to get something going if Syracuse is pulled right back into it it's 21 to 13 Panthers give some credit to the Syracuse defense which was very suspect and ineffective you men up into this ball game but they've been outstanding against this Pittsburgh offense Nebraska leading Missouri's 7 nothing in the first quarter first down out of the from the 19 yard line Marino pitching it back to Fred Jacob who has dropped down at the 22 a gain of three john Kinley keep rolling question is can anybody get within 50 of Ohio State these days look at this one he'll since in that at 21 Florida State 7 all the scores time permitting on our Prudential College School Board following the game it is second down and seven from the 22 they slot Benjie prior and then put him in motion jumping off on the left side was Gruber number 64 so the play whistled dead before its inception you you can believe that jackie sherrill is fuming the Pittsburgh team has lost their momentum and not quite as enthusiastic as they were early in the ball game they've had some bad things happen they're worried they have some doubt and that you can see it now is they take the huddle and they come out something Goods got the happen for them to get that enthusiasm back Syracuse has the momentum right now absolutely coming up next an furred against ASU most of you will see that those of you in Philly temple against Hawaii Moreno protected well to Jacobs who makes a catch up to 20 and is out of bounds at about the 23 well the Panthers started the year with a win over Kansas and they lost to North Carolina then they built back up to the point where last week they beat an unbeaten Navy team the midis unbeaten coming in 24 to 7 and as you say Frank perhaps a bit of a letdown today they did not seem to be emotionally charged and are very fortunate to have to lead by 8 at this point pretty much give it to return third and five the screen is said Cola 3035 Syracuse territory and tackled from behind Cedric Hinton able to catch up with them so DeBartolo involved in his second big play of the day the other pants reception was for a touchdown that was beautiful execution on the screen because Marino sets it up beautifully you think he's going to throw downfield there was a blitz off and DeBartolo catches the ball watch him stay inside the worst thing to do on the screen is get over on the bound and get pushed out finally gets caught from behind 36 yard gain to the Panthers at the 40 of Syracuse balls in motion and Jacobs abort failure runs into college columns number 33 Mike Johnny jumping out that run ouch on that screen should have fired up the Pittsburgh offensive unit again something like there the big play that gets them in scoring territory a little more enthusiasm second down and 8 to 40 to go third quarter 2113 Pittsburgh Moreno to the air on second down and eight what's the skill great catch at the 5yard line Barca Fame covering Ralph still handing on his fingertips and able to hold on just a sensational play any way you look at it that's a sensational troll and just as remarkable of catch the concentration by a young now still was just unbelievable let's watch still he's going to go in and force to the corner forced to the goal line that back to the corner watch his concentration right here holes all good and control to just before he goes out of bounds and as the Panthers start to come up with a first and goal they call a timeout so they'll get this serie straightened away 207 remaining in the third quarter that's pitch first timeout of the half Michigan rolling leading Wisconsin 33 nothing so they eat one out over Indiana no problems today Miami still with the lead over Penn State 13 to 10 in the second quarter Monday night nine o'clock eastern time on ABC good matchup Earl Campbell in the Houston Oilers greasing in the Miami Dolphins on Monday Night Football outstanding attraction this week again just look back to last year's confrontation in the dome what a night that was look at the sideline shot Moreno he's about 64 weighs 200 pounds and has got a slingshot forearm mechanically the coaches say he's just unbelievable for a freshman in his mechanics and throw the ball footwork whatever it takes went well you know his big question in the future Frank will be football or baseball he may be a Heisman Trophy candidate someday if he keeps going like this as a freshman he just remarkable fourth round draft pick by the Kansas City Royals on a high school first down goal from the five Jacobs in motion they give it to DeBartolo to the 433 in an attacker what you bet they go back to the past that they throw twice the touchdowns in the first half just the halfback out in the flat after fake into the tailback is really difficult to cover in college you got ananth man the fake will hold on safety an orbiter let's see if they throw it to take their system line up in the power I on second and goal rooster Jones looking for a black cuts inside wait be Bartolo was the man who sprung up so the Panthers ahead by only eight had stretched it out to 14 here it is the pic sweet back away from the formation DeBartolo 31 has gone throw the key block and rooster Joel sees daylight and he heads for the goal line and makes it so the Panthers with Mark Schubert lining up for the extra point see the call we have illegal procedure against Syracuse that'll move it after distance and let's see what jackie sherrill decides to do they'll still go for a one Jenner holding a Schubert stick is good so forty three thousand five working on it Stadium the Panthers in their final appearance 1979 with a minute a half remaining in the third quarter Pittsburgh out in front of Syracuse 28 to 13 as we check out the left side of the Panther line grooving number 64 and Finland number 62 watch them make the technique block of reaching out and scooping and holding the the brush Bingham 82 makes the block kick out block and look at the hole you could drive a truck through that's what good Blanca does Beck's like to see that out and DeBartolo turkish man totally out of the picture that defender never made the replay the travel of kickoff for Pittsburgh a man in the hands to go in the third quarter and the Panthers leading sir accused 28 to 13 right but Warren Warren er back for Syracuse line drive kick fifteen buck to the 30 and slides out at the 31 yard line so the Orangemen of syracuse taking over from here is to lane 33 nothing yale trying to stay unbeaten 11 over cornell in the third first down at the 31 morris just about back to the line of scrimmage we are ski number 68 was there was he there yeah 275 pounds nose guard and jackie sherrill told me that he can control the truck and the middle of the line and they respect the tacos protect wide second and ten Syracuse in the 31 under a minute to go in the period early makes the catch of the deflected pass Carlton Williamson and he's been able to pick that off that would have been six more for Pittsburgh let's watch monk run the pattern he's in the wing back position he's just slanting out in the flat and the Williams 11:48 turns in chases in the shadows and watch him go up he goes right through Williamson's hands but look at the concentration of luck he's an outstanding receiver already holds career interception records for Syracuse it's third down and one from the 40 early is three out of eight through the air today and the orange pick up the first down as Mandeville moves through the middle al is a third quarter closest Syracuse rushed for 183 yards which is more than double than the other six teams have rushed in the entire game mainly 91 that's riping is coming in the Panthers remember had yielded only 2.2 yards first out of 10 boorish on a play that will close out the third quarter they stopped at the line of scrimmage rather stop carrying officials have stopped the clock and now starting it again and so that will do it for the third quarter it'll be second and ten for Syracuse when the fourth period gets underway so at the end of three in pitch Davion Mitchell Peters 28 and the RS 13 TV in the city of Champions Pittsburgh Stadium in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania Al Michaels and Frank Broyles as we start the fourth quarter Pittsburgh leading Syracuse 28 to 13 Syracuse from its own 43 yard line its second down and 10 and early on a roll under some pressure he's going to keep it and brought down at the 47 yard line your green number 19 making the play green is the type of fella who could play several positions look at the stats Syracuse 18 first downs 210 for Pittsburgh rushing Pittsburgh only 47 yards total offense 174 but they've had one good drive of 80 yards and too many drives in a punt return Syracuse big edge time of possession that on the scoreboard it's 28 to 13 Pittsburgh third down and six from the 47 with monk in motion early coming back the other way they set up a nice screen and getting into Pittsburgh territory inside the 40 the 30 and brought down to the 25 is the tight end Tony Snyder number 81 now I can only ten years of color 30 when you spray on a tie in he's lost he is the toughest thing to cover in football this is a throwback screen to the tidy and watch how wild this he is acting first he's going to block read then he lets it go and then course is going to be no one here as you see Santa has one man to get away from he's blocked by one of the Lions and any very wisely stays inside the boundary makes whatever he can excellent call and perfect execution first answer refused at the 24yard line bunk in the slot to the right early pitching the Morris and down to the 19 yard line I agree with you that tylium screen is a great play why don't we see it more often I don't know that's one thing I don't think my team's ever covered they might throw it away or something like that but that was good at on this last play was perfect execution option play and the old man is saving some score was Jojo heat the free safety he filled the hole and stopped it for a 7 yard game the rock it's a tough play Virginia leading Georgia at the half 10 to nothing the Bulldogs only play well in their own conferences and they have tied for the lead in the Southeastern Conference for vixx's no defeat second down and three from the 17 inside the 15 ghost Mandeville he is close and I think just a little short of the first down he is short now Syracuse is using something a half million years on eightman offensive level and that was the defensive me if they've got all eaten alive screaming no flank on two running backs in a quarterback they've used that on short yardage no get worse times during the game they fit fair effective for and here they have a third down coming out of yep they send two men wide this time on third down and less than a yard Turley keeps and has the first down get into the fourth game they are ski made the stop he can't count Syracuse after you are inviting enough he'll battle most of the way they're down by 15 but mounting a good Drive here and a first down at the 13 yard line you've got to give this offensive unit of Syracuse credit because they're going to get small the top defensive teams in America and they've kept their pores and discs good for the Knitting as we say in Cote 12:55 to go early tenyard was you green who came in to make the tackle he was lined up as a linebacker old that particular point green we started to mention before not only plays a lot of positions defensively but look at him he's the type of guy he could be a quick split end maybe even a tight end probably a basketball player how about a fullback you name it he's just a great athlete strike like a Cobra second down and seven are in motion and Hurley click out complete no one official started to market five and the other said no sir aren't bunked the receiver I don't know really which one you would go buy one did call it as you mentioned al another called it incomplete let's watch it for mins on see if we can detect the is it illegal pass or isn't pretty close pretty close I believe the man that called it complete had our view from the Enzo and I believe that it was complete but it's third down and seven instead early turns it inside leaps in for the touchdown play you gotta like that and as we mentioned before jackie sherrill said the pit coach after watching films he doesn't care about his body at all he proved it on that play he'll the scouts up in the press box had to call that play they went in the same formation that they went on the previous play Pittsburgh moved all the way over and he ran the option play back way from the short side of an unbalanced line and scored what an effort by Hurley so the crowd has been stilled it's 28 to 19 and now they're going to go for two with 1156 to go see if he runs the option again monk in motion early on a roll throws complete for the two points to monk so they close to within seven don't count the orange out and 11:56 to go in Pittsburgh it's the Panthers 28th Syracuse 21 Sugar Ray Leonard Olympic champ now undefeated bro this month egos for the big one the WBC welterweight championship on ABC 11:56 to play 28 to 21 Pittsburgh with the orange to kick off Gary Anderson the potent light rays in his back Joe Joe heat things up and then let's it go through the end zone for the touchdown once again here is the touchdown watch Pearlie hurdle in this much is an option plate to the short side unbalanced rot and the reason is successful Pittsburgh had moved all of their defensive end over with month going in motion and it was a great call by the Syracuse day who would thoughts you run an option played the short side of the unbalanced line for 10 yards in a touchdown 69 yards took a couple of ticks over three minutes to do it 28 to 21 Panthers from the 20 its rooster Jones has a bank hole 30 and out to the 37 yard line 17 is rough it's 15 the right cornerback made the tackle this burg needed that particular run they needed something to get him started again more a big play like that didn't help all of the 38 first and 10 no one's again for a yard christine bourie made the tackle let's go back into the twopoint conversion the pants come on fans watch 45 the wide receive in lotion Pittsburgh is gonna bust the defense no one's around wide open two points clock running with eleven ten to go dan Marino the sixth for two hundred pound freshman second and nine Panthers out of the I the I back is Jones I are in motion Jones again his third straight carry and rooster gets belted at the 43 loses the ball syracuse vision if i soul accurately what I thought I saw Jim Connors put a hit on they go back to hell the vote let's watch it from the end zone and see if 33 doesn't knock him loose from the ball that's what we call a take away fumble number 33 goodness he's going to pursue right out of the line keeping leverage then when when Jules turns back Wow and there's the ball right out on the ground and the recovery made by Mike zanuck number 48 so the orange with a first down at the panther 43 yard line they're back in business and it's Morris who gets to the floor you've got to give them a lot of credit for the Syracuse team here's a team that has played all of its games on the road this year Summit neutral sites but every week it's a bus ride or a plane ride and make sure you got your credit cards because they don't have a stadium one is being dealt will play under a dome in 1980 but all from home this year the syracuse back up on the second down and seven at the 40 early at the 37 loose ball but they've got it back Syracuse recovers drew Kissinger on top of it coming up the second half of our doubleheader today from Cano out though it's Stanford and you'll see a good young quarterback in church show nerd against Arizona State those of you in Philadelphia from Aloha Stadium in Honolulu you'll see Hawaii against a good temple team crucial down al third and four third and four from the 37 yard line Pearlie looking and keeping and getting to the 35 yard line so he short by about two Pulu si made the tackle and a big fourth down coming up out he could have run if he had just made up his mind a little faster he'd have made the first down and a walk but he wanted to throw he kept looking for the throw once he decided to run it was too late and short too 35 look at Maloney golly I'm fired up myself huh look at boy if you think he's not fired there's a man who has been under some heats and pressure at Syracuse but done a remarkable job this year all things considered and trying to pull off an upset today fourth and two back timorous doesn't get it they throw him for a loss out of bounds at the 37 yard line Robin Williamson was there to make sure he couldn't turn the corner all right now baloney talking to his defenses they come back in you can't play the option playing appellant Pittsburgh does right here let's watch the first phase the dive back then the quarterback is forced out the line of scrimmage he pitches too quickly forced to by the excellent play of the Pittsburgh defense not the first down very critical day at the 37 the Panthers with a first down and we've got a timeout with 832 remaining 832 left and hit the Panthers lead by 7 three years after the birth of its women's division the NJCAA offers championships in thirtyone sports the NJCAA applauds the junior colleges for expanding opportunities for women in sports Pittsburgh with a ball at their own 37 yard line 8 32 to go the Panthers leading 28 to 21 Marino giving it to Jacobs on a sweep and he runs into a gang at the 38 yard line a gain of 1 second and 9 again in on the stop was John Kinley number 43 he's had an excellent football game not very big for a defensive end but has been quickness and has been able to get involved in the past pound and pass rush and also the squeeks second entity marino complete 2d bipolar to the 42yard Seibert making the tackle so it's third down and the lord 542 tension tied out on top seven nothing third and five and Marino's got the first down our trail stopped at the Syracuse 45 yard line now when you drop back and send out five receivers you're doing two things you're forcing the defense to cover the entire width of the field you'll force them to cover the depth of the field and that's why those short men opening can and Moreno can fire the ball to them for the first down Syracuse almost gives you that short pass because their defensive backs play very soft on the 46 screen to set up its Hawkins again he's got some molds gets from the 34 that's another first half of the Panthers excellent tall scream that you knew that they would I think we all knew that Syracuse was going to put a big rush old and they did and they just got fooled right inside good execution and let's watch Hawkins turn inside then watch the loop right there how about that Oh protect that football leading the game two hands when you get the crowd up to 35 pockets again buried at the 34 yard line clock running six and a half minutes to play as we remember to recap Pittsburgh scored three times the first half once on a punt return once on a fumble and what's on a short kick nothing of their own power they moved 80 yards for their punch down in this half mostly on pass very little running by Pittsburgh second and ten flags are down two of them thrown at the line of scrimmage and the pass complete to Ralph still at the 22 yard line but let's check the pun illegal illegal procedure Pittsburgh you know al I agree with the coaches saying that Marino mechanically is just virtually perfect with his footwork with his arm is quickrelease any young watching this telecast it wants to see perfect mechanics and throwing the football the next time we isolate watches watch out call he stands in the in the pocket break and see it can throw over the defensive rush and when he throws the ball the I cannot cut it's gone his mechanics are just virtually perfect it's second and 15 from the 40 Marino oh pass was right there still couldn't hold on you're not going to see that very much though still was a great high school athlete number 88 he rushed over 200 yards 2,000 yards as a quarterback over 2,000 yards passing and his playing wide receiver and they let him out run his route to the open area he can change him after the defense shows him what the coverage is going to be they just leave that option up to him there are the figures on Marino 17 at a 24 third and 15 from the 40 put some pressure on this time and the pass to the 25yard line deep fryer it is short of a first down so they go to prior and find him but Benji is shy of the first time by a little more than a yard he's got a rifle arm head yeah terrific he just fired the ball right in and the defensive line backers had no chance to go for it with five minutes to play and they get it it's Jacob's carrying to the 21 yard line Brandon name run right over mark Bay 280pound offensive tackle with quick feet something you'll see they'll picture mark Bay number 73 Cincinnati woohoo still leading Florida State 21 7 3rd quarter time committing all the scores on a Prudential College scoreboard following the game first down the 21 yard line Moreno to the air again and Jacobs can't hold on this time one thing that moreno gives you is that great arm but one thing that he does to to the offense he restricts it a little bit since he doesn't run the option plays that Ricardo does so the combination in these last three ballgames if they play pretty affect to be very effective second down and ten from the 21 sir accused so the orange get the break they so dearly me at this point with 432 remaining I feel pain now he pulls out a little bit earlier and the Senate obviously had missed his hands and threw it right back up into her stomach and result of thumb well he was a little anxious to get set up and throw the ball big break for Syracuse Marco Bane recovers and so the orange from their own 23 Brees at their backs four and a half to go hit leads by 7 early to the 26 not used a timeout in this after they have all three remaining differ style of play by Syracuse than Pittsburgh they don't have the time to pass offense now that force you can cover the width and the depth of the field it's all ruled out fast that's right no homerun ball but they've got the time 405 second and seven keeping again just about to the line of scrimmage so it'll be third down and seven did you see Pittsburgh's defense recover that was a just shows of quickness and that's the key to a good defensive team they were circled and they came out the line and held Hurley to a short Dean of parks me yard third down and seven running 322 5 left the ball up at 26 bait early throws over the middle has monofin complete to the 40yard line in the first down for Syracuse why wouldn't you go to the best receiver you've got that's what senior quarterback does watch muck run the path cross the middle he has to sidestep the linebacker Jackson he breaks right across the middle and course Hurley throws the ball between the linebackers where it can't be intercepted in what concentration muck has for the reception controls it beautifully clock running 303 302 remaining in the game first down Syracuse from the 40 we had movement on the left side of the Syracuse line now that's a I would argue with a fifth they penalize Syracuse I would argue with the fishing the defenses and offensive end does not to be stationary he can move any time he wants to that is a mistake now in my opinion there was what here it is we're going to look at the replay the offensive end can move but he is legal to move he can move it's a five inside interior lineman that can't move once they take their place Michels mess out of mouse much as they call it correctly Bologna not particularly happy there's a caution 5 and its first and 15 going be for more and we get a flag there was a wrestling match and let's see who they calling interference it could go either way it could go either way it is on Syracuse a wrestling match as the let's watch it now curly is going to scramble to the right he buys a lot of time and muck is all the way down the field he can't throw the ball that far enough and so they had to come back I guess he interfered with him before SCO died so 45 number 45 apartment he tries to get behind Heath number 36 now let's see what happens they went to death yes there's left are pushed Heath the side trying to make the play so back to the 20 to make it second down and 30 2:33 to go it's a strange call 42nd and 3030 you've got to gain at eight well what ten yards and a wife yeah it's hard to do in the run but I guess they felt like they were 24 with the team defensive team brushing they might have a chance to pop the Blitz tried to go in the element of surprise but they haven't got board started down 26 he's open tackle back at the 18yard line so monk just couldn't get loose to throw it syracuse had was going to throw a lateral let's watch and see just how wide open Siebert number 26 is down the field but monk could not get time to throw the ball there would have been the touchdown that was Haggerty going deep now fourth down and a half a mile it's fourth and 32 and they send in white to kick so they'll putt and then take their timeouts on defense Heath's going to let it bounce and then it's down at midfield so Syracuse opting for the puck he'll take your timeouts now defensively they have a three remaining we have put an 8 to go and hit leads by 7 in a mustwin pac10 battle with Stanford or Central Michigan Toledo and gentle Hawaii check the listings on ABC the Sun Devils and the cards and what should be a great one to offensive power houses out of Palo Alto coming up next for most of you those of you in Philadelphia you'll see temple against Hawaii here its first and ten kid from midfield a minute eight to go the orange have to stop them and then call timeouts Hawkins gets three spend the time I don't I do rapidly they play consumed five seconds and we have a minute three so that's time out number one spent by sir occurs they have two remaining and Pitt will have a second down and seven post Pitt Syracuse will jump right up into the gap they've got everybody on the line of scrimmage and uh what you tell your team here is you protect the football you want over here make some yardage if you possibly can hold on the football both hands make what you can use up as much time jackie sherrill going over the strategy with Dan Marino and Collins the linebacker and one of the captains for Syracuse back with the instructions from Maloney against the suspect Syracuse deepest Pittsburgh was only able to move one his main drive Imola 50 yards for the touchdown 2nd down and 7 from the 47 103 to go and it's our drill Hawkins and he's dropped after he gets about three and a half and Syracuse will use another timeout so that will stop the clock we have 54 seconds remaining and it'll be third down when we come back well there's rector econo the injured quarterback we're in the capitol baseball champion pirates enjoying run enjoying but having an offday hamstring pull he'll be back in a couple of weeks meanwhile 3340 crave he the first time here and they get in its pocket rotates into the 28th Tom Siebert made the tackle our Chevrolet most valuable players in today's game and we've had the slew to choose from we've selected Terry White of the Panthers number 23 the defensive back who ran back the punt for the touchdown Bill Hurley for Syracuse the outstanding option quarterback Bill Hurley keeping them in the game until the very end there is the FB page of the Panthers Terry wait my trill Hawkins the call again stopped at the line of scrimmage when remember Syracuse can only stop the clock one more time we have 21 seconds remaining and that's their final timeout so there is Hurley here's her least stance he's rushed 24 times for 80 yards and 1 TD he pays six times and 13 times six completions for 72 yards 152 yards total offense against some outstanding fit defense can see how distraught early is but I tell you that man is very impressive what a day you got to admire that kid too the way he plays yeah he's he's the heart of that offensive football team and I can see why jackie sherrill has been so concerned of course two years ago when he played he had a great game even though fit pulled it out late in the game and also three years ago in fact he had a low outstanding game that Pittsburgh came from behind the win we had him all the way yeah easy easy to say at this point hardly the case though the Panthers are going to win it but they had to scratch and fight and claw their way to what's going to be their sixth consecutive victory in a 7 and 1 record going into the final three games of the year and Danny Moreno is going to give everybody another thrill by juggling the ball but then recovering it you really just want to fall on it now and let the backs come up if you fumble it make the recovery that's it sorry orange out of timeouts Syracuse and however it's the Panthers who prevail defeat Syracuse 28 to 21 Malati and Cheryl Jackie coming away with win number seven the Panthers win it the final score 28 21 we'll be right back I'm sure LT I feel at home in front of the camera but behind the camera I don't know the difference between",

  "transcript": "directly from Three Rivers Stadium that's Berg Pennsylvania it's the NFL on CBS the Washington Redskins versus the Pittsburgh Steelers hi everybody Curt Goudy Hank Stram perfect day for football the Steelers trying to stay on top of their division they're seven and two they're the defending Kings and Jack Pardee the coach of the Redskins said we can't take a double bogey meaning we can't lose two in a row so what's the mental strategy here for this game Hank Stram well the mental strategy is very obvious Curt I think very obviously that the Pittsburgh Steelers after winning two big games at one against Denver and one against Dallas has to maintain that same high level of efficiency from enthusiasm standpoint and on the other hand why the Washington Redskins have to bounce back from a surprising loss to the New Orleans Saints all right the Redskins that won the toss they're going to receive and let's get out of the field there he is by Matt Barr we'll kick it off the booth there the return here he's over the 30 and out to the 34 an attacker was made by Zach Valentine a rookie linebacker from East Carolina all right here they are up front burbling is the left tackle Saul's a left guard goes eels the center Williams at right guard starts the right tackle and the youngster Don Warren had tied in bugs and Thompson the wide receivers the back fee will be Theismann Wiggins and Malone first down Redskin first down throwing it out pattern rookie Thompson had turned the wrong way Iseman purposely threw that ball haidle because there were two Steelers there was a chance of an interception you know one thing it's going to be very important for Washington this afternoon is going to be the fact that they must be able to hit their tight end Don Warren or Jean Fugate both of whom have caught 10 and 11 passes respectively but you have to have a tight end who who has good speed and can lick the double zone of the Pittsburgh Steelers second down ten teen Fugate is in a tight end for the Redskins ghosting alone at the 36 yard line of the Redskins by Jack Lambert who leads the Steelers and tackles third and 8 and now the passing backs receiving back to come in buddy Hardiman number 22 Flair's Harmon 38 Riskin he was a different team on every down there's Lambert allpro middle linebacker enjoying a great year he's intercepted five bashful Larry Anderson is a Nickelback Dennis Winston of God linebacker today telecast presented by authority of the National Football League and it's intended for the private use of our audience any rebroadcast or other use of this telecast express written consent of the Steelers of the National Football League is prohibited punt formation during the kicking will be Mike Bragg he's averaged thirty eight and a half yard to kick the safety man is Theo bell Bragg has not had a kick block this year hi twist expire and a lot about that on the to 11 yard line Bonnie Coleman the young linebacker very fast an impressive player down the cover they were lucky that time Kurt because field bill the ball bounced into him but fortunately he was able to recover that certain that won the fumble but the ball hit him but had he not recovered it pizza reached Pittsburgh recovered it would have been the first down ready for the Washington Redskins had they fallen on the football Stallworth and Swann the wide receivers Bradshaw Sidney Thornton and rocky Dwyer this is Thornton a13 this is a good defensive team the Steelers are going against the Redskins have allowed the fewest points this year of any team in the National Football League and the Steelers are number one in total offense their second rushing and for passing and on the other side of the football the Redskins are fifth in total defense seven against the rush and three against the pass and you just took a look at the Redskins defense my Nick Coleman replaces Wysocki at right linebacker second down 13 yard line no score were early righto throw just caught this 40 second pass of the year and he leads the National Football League for the most yards gained and receiving passing you know I think it's a game goes along is going to be very obvious that they're going to work on Joe lavender the right cornerback which they just completed the pass in front of him on an outside move lamar parish has intercepted seven balls so far this season very unusual for a quarterback but he's one of the very best in the business and I'm sure that they'll stay away from him and not concentrate a lot on the other side down Steelers 22 Franklin eats 13 yards then he's to 8,000 yards in his career only the 8th back in the history of the league to reach at least 8,000 yards he did a good job of running on the play the play was really designed to go either inside or outside of the offensive right tackle Larry Brown he started inside jumped to the outside and made a nice gain even though he had the ball in the wrong arm he should have it on the right side away from the pressure of Ian at the inside pursuit coming from the Washington Redskins Jerry Mullins out at guard Steve corsica then Franco Harris now has 8,000 only Jimmy Brown OJ Simpson Jim Taylor and Joe Perry have more and the next step or Franco Harris will be Joe Perry whereas the 378 more yards this was a trap laid by the right tackle seed break guard seed person 77 they trapped the defensive right tackle tyrant Albert and he popped through there for a nice game he's hemmed in and he's hit for a loss they poured it on in that time uncle it's the middle linebacker was one of the players he's number 52 he's a member of the pole line ducek is the left linebacker okhla wits the metal linebacker Wysocki the right linebacker they're all poised and how about they just got through playing the Pennsylvania polka the theme song of the police Prince Bobby Benton he's reported he's right now he's from right down the street he's very big here like he is all over the country second down ten no score Oh or when a judge by Dave butts but really penetrating off on the snap hit Sidney Thornton and stops him for a half yard loss and suddenly the Steelers now our third and tenth of that watch butts he comes across there nobody blocks him it's always nice to be a defensive lineman and come across the line of scrimmage get penetration when nobody touches you they're three wide receivers for this team great for the baby short Stallworth by the way now Scott passes in 38 consecutive games of club record 40 games and they're short of a first down you know Terry Bradshaw already delivered a great pass that time the safety man Houston was coming over to make a play so he evidently saw him coming from the inside threw the ball a little bit outside stalwart still made a great catch but it wasn't enough for the first down buddy hard him on the safety man for the redskins crate Colquitt will punt now he is the only two step kicker in the league now watch it they'll take the snap and go only two steps most of them are three step kickers two steps of the advantage get the ball away from here who's kept up hangs it up there nicely Bart Ehrman calls for the forget fumbled the ball and the fumble helped him pick up three yards as he's on it 20 yard line where the Redskins will take over when we resume here in the first period with no score what is it meatloaf sandwich in our life we all know one appreciate White has one first lessons like Olivia but the best thing is it tastes great my spell egg like beer from there everything you always wanted in a beer unless World Series baseball chance to fire and what a lot of champions are to the city two yards and he got in the hard way it was finally Lambert who hauled him down with some help for JT Thomas number 24 McDaniel comes in to replace Danny bug to the wide receiver warned about and Fugate checks in to the tight end we're not going to try and give you all these changes but the party changes three or four players on every doubt check in on the keyword shutting down 8 break into the setback iseman tosses the clicks for John McDaniel and he should have it up for the first down as they crossed his dirty take it out of bounds by the left linebacker Jack ham they were in a slot formation that time and ham was covering on the play man for man he threw the ball out in front nicely made the catch and of course they moved the ball and have a good first down situation coming up right now the Redskin passing attack has diversified they have one game this year were eight different players at least one time I'd like to go to their backs alive brigands for the 35 they play what they call the short passing game are they high efficient passing David Hank Stram will explain that to you well they like to throw a lot of high percentage passes which means they like to throw the ball to the backs on the flat or the tight in and short situations because they don't have to throw the ball very far they don't need a lot of protection a lot of time to protect and so for that reason they're very high percentage passes and a possession kind of passes very much like the run know wide receiver by the way for the Reds game has caught a touchdown pass in the last seven games seven the scrambler is rolling for yardage he has 37 he got out very quickly out of my jackhammer was coming up to make the tackle and he exercise very very good judgment he was heading up feel when he saw 59 could flash in front of his face he very wisely ran out of bounds to stop the clock any time I saw Jack Lambert anywhere up a dark alley out in the football field on a dance floor right right Harmon and Hardeman H&amp;H boys are in the Redskin backfield Robin Colby comes a pork linebacker for the everybody have a disastrous season but they haven't or a gifting they got to him and there was Robin Pohl blitzing the right line number 56 votes for goodbye again that time they use a double wing formation which means I have two people on the right side two on the left of the ball and one in the backfield it was not enough people back there to protect for the pass in the event that they did blitz he had to throw it away and it fell in completely shake this one disgusted I think he hit it up on top of his ankle for 19 yards there's no score in for 19 yards there's no score in the first quarter I feel at home in front of the camera but behind the camera I don't know the difference between a lens opening and a Broadway opening so I rely on my Olympics om 10 my trusty om 10 gets great shot automatically with Olympus om 10 great shots introducing the first new truck of the 80s the new Ford LeBlanc distance champ it has the longest range of any truck in America with a standard 19 gallon tank plus optional tank you've got a 38 gallon capacity that gives it an estimated range with optional overdrive of 722 miles based on EPA ratings the estimated highway is 1102 miles more than onethird the length of America on one Phillip Ford pickups the longest range of any truck in America Sunday Anne Meara joins Archie Bunker's place as a streetsmart cook who can really dish it out don't be stupid very a private man there Chuck Noll who if he wins today we'll tie Vince Lombardi 95 wins 14th on the alltime list he doesn't have doing a clever quotes he says when the postgame show is better than the game that is wrong flipping a gate without I'd be an interception it merely was Ken Houston covering Franco Harris and Franco had his back to the ball Hey yes he did looked like he anticipated catching the ball at all he was running downfield looked like he was clearing out the area for the outside receiver Lynn Swann but when the ball was thrown and he wasn't expecting it at all and it fell incomplete second down ten Steelers on their 45 what a day for a football beautiful crispy Buffalo leading New England 3nothing a Patriots have trouble always at Buffalo you'll go by the bills downtown look at the mustache let's complete for a first down Randy Grossman a little tight end we just tie a sevenpassenger season worse down Steelers there on the Redskin 44 yeah I was surprised I went in to see Terry today and soup strainer and he's going to not only go on a countryandwestern tour singing now he's in the gospel say he and he's the institution here you just no score first attempt steelers investment on the Washington 44 frank O'Hara they've got it okay he's hit there by koi bacon they say you can't teach an old dog new tricks you can teach number 79 bacon to be better against the run he's a tremendous pass rusher but he's playing a run much better this year you know one thing that Pittsburgh does extremely well as well as anybody in professional football they liked the trap especially an even spacing that being employed here by the Washington Redskins which means that you have two tackles over the offensive guard linebacker over the offensive Center second down ten for the Steelers receivers go out short one nearly picked off there by number 59 Brad dishes intended for Lynn Swann now it's third and ten Philadelphia at Browns 6nothing Jaworski to Carmichael so Carmichael keeps at the street going that's 106 for him point was missed we had the Eagles last week their coach was very unhappy for a meal not that clubs fired up today yeah they should be they better be because they have to bounce back and continue to win if they hope to be in the playoffs like they were a year ago that time Bradshaw threw a very poor pass he was falling away and threw it end of the turf the hundred and sex in the rover Carmichael and they correct myself they're down ten for the Steelers he's dropped by Bradshaw we could move around who he puts it out woofle came back he had driven the receiver almost inside the five and came back worked himself wide open he was split on the left side working on Kenny Houston who normally is a strong saftey he had him covering man for man Terry jumped out of the pocket had plenty of time was finally approached by a defensive lineman but by that time the tight end Grossman was able to turn Houston completely around and he was wide open made the catch first down Steelers on the red no score five twenty to go in the first period our first going threat that's our second look that's what's so great about having a quarterback move as well as Bradshaw he was been back into the pocket got some pressure watching sanded her nicely get some pressure jumps over to the left side away from all the traffic throws across to the middle of the field the stalwart who had maneuvered himself to be wide open in the end zone made the catch and they'll go ahead so that's another that bars kick 55 yards in six plays our first score find Pittsburgh ladies that another why have over 1 million people sighs there breaks was it because they know has break mechanics of their specially trained was it because they know has a right break box of stock was it because they know Midas has over 20 years experience under the car well whatever the reason it certainly was no accident it pays to mighta sized your brakes after all these years I still like working out what I really like is a beer that's waiting for me when it's over and if you work out the way we do there'd better be a lot of beer waiting with me that's why we drink Light beer from Miller Lite has 1/3 less calories in regular beer and that's less filling and it tastes great take it my guy who works out a lot could really use one right now familiar everything you always wanted in a beer unless Matt bar will kick off the buddy Hardiman Monday night on CBS the white shadow followed by mashed and WKRP if he in Cincinnati all on CBS Monday night there's backfires kick the high one cardamon waiting on the forum he's out to the 10 to the 15 finds a hole and is wrapped up on a 23 and is it there by number 30 Larry and a kick returner Redskins ball on our 23 yard line with the first down the Redskins have had trouble scoring in the first quarter only twice in their last 22 games that they sought a touchdown in the first period up to come eyes been the quarterback belong and Riggin running back but sometimes from the wide receivers warning that idea play action out of Gaza bud Jonah hits pattern mad by lc Greenwood number 68 Nina Kenny Houston that that was a nice looking playaction they faked to the left the backs were leaning to the left he faked to the left through the right away from the inside pursuit of the Pittsburgh Steelers and picked up the nice fiveyard chunk on the play second down five to go twenty the rats did their ball not much up that middle but bill green and Gary done in there it's still the Steel Curtain here they've allowed their opponents just the shade over three yards of rush this year Joe Green isn't the dominating pass rusher he used to be number 75 but he still plays the run very tough smart sheds blockers green woods had to come back at left and done and Furness our younger players Bannon sack of white all ready to ride in they use six potential glamour molinator except for green and wingless bird down three guys women flag is down JT Thomas banging hard in a Hartmann it threw a flag on it let's see what it is our first penalty looks like there's a penalty against the Steelers that's holding against the Steelers it'll be an automatic Redskin first down the score is 7 nothing Steelers leading 344 to play in the first period holding number 49 defense that's on the rookie Dwayne Woodruff University of Louisville who's starting place of Johnson Woodruff making his first start a year ago he was in a Louisville hospital with a brain concussion he played with Hank Stram son down alone ganging up on him on the 37 or 38 yard line honey shell Lambert's in there second down seven for the pursuit of the Pittsburgh team that time was excellent and is very difficult to take the ball from the left side of the ball to the right side of the ball takes so much time that by the time you get there as a ball carrier you have to hold your block so long but the Pittsburgh Steeler defense is there waiting for you and that's what happened on the last play longest run against the Steelers this year the 21 yard Dorsett last week Hey frigging outside even get outside finally Donny Sheldon on the 43 yard line a gain of five for the Redskins and I believe them third and two that was a counter play that time run by Wigan Riggins he made a fake to the right and then came back to his left did a good job of outrunning the pursuit from the inside and made a nice gain in the play he has a chance for another thousand yard max we're going to pass a run for we're going to pass for he has a first down he hit his receiver coming out of the backfield buddy heart of him and he was pulled down by Jack Lambert Hardiman from Iowa State firstyear player in NFL came out of the Canadian League it was a great illustration of the high percentage pass that we were talking about earlier that you brought up hurt he just went down just enough for the first down worked on a linebacker he got the ball to and right at the numbers and and of course it was good for the first half why incite 21yard snapped the Rutger they Lady Eagles seven stick to the first story first down Redskins on her own 47 yard line Steelers they had seven numbers out of the backfield was bending along that doesn't go for much he's dropped on his 48 yard line by Jack Hammond Jack Lambert the Redskins this week worked on one thing better pass protection Dallas leads the Giants three nothing the skins gave up seven sacks last week to the Norlin Saints frustrating game for the skins 21 plays they ran inside New Orleans 10 yard line yet that came out of the game with only 10 points and a Steelers have intercepted 19 passes and have 24 sacks going into this game second down eight for the Redskin they go there's a crossing pattern and bugs can't hold on to her bugs started down and crossed over the middle that's Jack ham if you pick one player in the NFL but you said could almost be a perfect player for his position many would pick Jack ham as an outside linebacker yes he's exactly what you would order through the Sears catalog if you had a chance to have all the linebackers that they Penn State campus has turned into the NFL he's the best one in every school had a good with Robin call becomes a fourth line back we might look for him to flip their dominate for the Redskins from their 40 bull was glitzy passes the plate for a first down nice catch by Claire's Harmon coming out of the backfield and he was nipped around by Jack Lambert and Chauhan is an excellent pass receiving back yes he is and Joe Theismann deserves a lot of credit they were in a double wing formation that time a blitz was coming coming inside he got rid of the ball in good shape to the outside Harmon made the catch another linebacker halfback related play and it's another good game first intended him for the Washington Redskins yes radar Mosely listen up first time Redskins on the Steeler 39 7nothing Steelers ahead in the first period a pump is going deep deep deep he hits him on the floor and that is Ricky Thompson number 83 the pump thinks I'm looking for the surety of it in will to get confident yes he has good field position backs went to the left fullback stayed in the block he gave him a pump brought a room to threw up throw through over the top perfectly Ricky Thompson number 83 makes the catch but a beautiful play and he licked a rookie Dwayne Woodruff on the play alright let's see what the Redskins do now in scoring range as we just said they didn't do it against the Saints last week inside 210 now the 1st and goal is the quarterinch area from nowhere without the treatment this is no car this is a legend you better believe I give her the treatment STP oil treatment since 1964 over half a billion cans have been sold no other brand even comes close so do what millions do give your car the treatment from STP this

spectacular see the heavyweights in action in the world powerlifting championships plus part two of the battle of the NFL cheerleaders and the conclusion of the World Series of Poker you'll say you saw it on CBS Sports Curt Goudy Hank's brand second period coming up Steelers leading seven nothing if I were Washington in this situation on a first and goal I would throw the ball on first and ten they're very hard to run against in this dough line area but this would be a good time for a playaction or some kind of a pass on first and four Joe Theismann up on the Steeler four yard I'm betting alone are the backs and is gonna roll it throws at hyacinth complete and he was passing on first down but he had a hurry like a down four to go for a Redskin touchdown he promised his show were pouring in around yes they didn't go for the fake at all Harmon faked up the middle had they faked to the same side of where they were trying to throw the football I think it would have been more effective and he might have been able to hole the outside linebackers a little bit better than he did by faking Harmon up the middle and relieving the outside linebackers of the pressure they got a full house back here Malone Wiggins and Harmon they put Harmon on the wing suck it in for for a Redskin touchdown that's Riggin we may go he didn't they took advantage that time when they got more they did and made it look easy he faked inside started over the right tackle jumped to the outside and went into the end zone without anybody touching him whatsoever good takeoff by the offensive line the right side but you see Riggins went into the middle area and bounced to the outside this is something that he does extremely well though after being frustrated last week Reston's cash in play Joe Theismann a few quarterbacks on a leg who still holds four place kicks Bosley boots nineteen mostly there and the kids happy and have tied this game up at seven home sorry I said we are not interested in their proposal the meeting is next Thursday bill thing you should remember about this not knowing how to listen has cost American business billions of dollars well as one of the world's major corporations we at Sperry are doing something about it we've set up extensive listening programs that Sperry employees worldwide can take part in and when you do business with Sperry UNIVAC or any of our other divisions you're going to discover that Sperry listens like no one you've ever done business with Sperry we understand how important it is to listen his luxury obsolete not at all it's here in Lincoln Continental 1980 all the traditional look field of luxury private now with a dramatic 41% increase in epaestimated miles per gallon over last year and the standard equipment an ingenious new automatic overdrive transmission Lincoln Continental 1980 Town Car and town coupe a Mosley will kickoff on the fiveyard line Mosley doesn't kick into the end zone usually Larry Anderson and Terry Bradshaw rule Louisiana Tech it's a high kick he takes it onto six he's up to the 15 to the 20 the 25 his forward motion stops about the 30 26 yard line and down the covers like for clay who came up with the Patriots and then move over to the Redskin there's the story of the Washington scoring drive by the way that touchdown by the Redskins is only the second rushing touchdown allowed by the Steelers in the last five games Pittsburgh's ball honor 26 first down Harrison fort now behind Terry Bradshaw make now the toss look at that crowd there were three Redskins and two Steelers all bunched up together four Redskins actually six of them jammed up against the Steeler sideline in front of the steal event and bacon it put a hard rush on Terry Bradshaw they must have blown the pattern that time because they wouldn't be two receivers that close together on a pattern like the one they just threw already there were five people and in the sideline area and one bullet would have gotten all of them the Steelers despite their record have made some mistakes this year especially crumbling they lead the league in losing the most fumbles 17 Silvan against Cincinnati how good you are when you give it away badly latch on a quick drop he's tremendous not only getting but after the great thing about him is you know that he knows exactly where the open areas are all the time Bradshaw goes back and very simple drop that pattern protection is good he runs inside then outside and has the presence to know where the pressure is coming from that time ducked under a tackle scampered upfield and was finally tackled by oka wits number 52 41 yards for Lynn Swann on that catch he's averaged 19 yards of catch he missed three games with a hamster at the 15 he was dancing around like a boxer where shall i jabber the uppercut I've gotta make some kind of them it's amazing the way Bradshaw got rid of this football here they come Boca whis is coming right up the middle but he got the ball up on top the timing of the play was unbelievably good star Worth came back for the ball made the catch in front of Joe lavender and it's another big play for the Pittsburgh Steelers this is about the story the last four or five years for this club Swann on one side Star Wars on the other when they get in trouble and branch on moulds that strong right on look out I couldn't put those points up in a hurry first down Jennifer Swan Parrish covering is there a better quarterback on the league that Lamar Perry I know if there is one I haven't seen him he's intercepted seven passes already and he did a beautiful job on that last play of knocking the ball down he ran inside and got one arm in front and knocked the ball down and fell incomplete Prince Valiant had just passed 32 yards to Johnny Perkins and the Giants lead the Cowboys 7 3 they'll be going bananas are the better lands Giants trying to win their fifth in a row stealers on the Redskin throw but pitch to Thornton shortened to the ten then they bumping down at the nine I thought that plate was going to go for more when I first started a yeah they had linebacker stacked up inside the car was a good one in that they went away from the overload of the linebackers inside try to get outside to the formation which means that both outside receivers are on the right side of the football in that case but they didn't succeed in making a lot of yardage on the play Whalen's Cockcroft has kicked a 39 yard field goal of Browns lead Eagles been six for his period and right now we have a third and seven Steelers on the Redskin 9 the game is tied 7 all early in the second period Jim Smith Fennell deferred wide receiver they chased bradshaw around he throws it away Stallworth was open at the goal line if Peter hit him but I think he was just trying to unload he didn't see anyone he got pressure at that time and just got rid of the football penalty against the Washington Redskins this'll hurt the Redskins they had that place top moves the ball to the floor it's holding it's an automatic first and goal Dondre YT within there how it has stirred down and the yard and a half to go the pass and complete the scholar Worf down in the yard and a half to go and here comes the field goal theme on sit bar great colquitt the punter will hold for him sit Thornton that time circle into the endzone was totally on a terry rolled to his right and didn't see him on the play this is a shorty a 21 yard attempt by Matt Barr who has kicked 6 out of 12 the season that pick is up that is good in the speeder definitely back again yard field goal 1237 living in it is Pittsburgh 10 and Washington 7 the new pension laws were driving me crazy so I call the Connecticut general people and as they

play went for three at second down seven we talked about the Steelers leading the league in losing the ball by fumbled the most the Redskins have lost only five fumbles this year they're tied with the Giants for low in the National Conference it down seven voila we've got some room we hadn't dropped it John McDaniel was there Wayne Woodruff on him you'll never really have control of the ball no the ball he went down and drove the quarterback back got interned stopped in front was in a great position to make the catch but for some reason just dropped it it looked like he might have taken his eye off the ball plans Harmon and Hardiman come in the backfield Clarence Harmon by the way the father of a baby girl this morning these Redskins producer Brad deusex wife had twins during training camps mike ragz wife had twins about two weeks ago productive as well we're down felon this team on the Blake Ricky Thompson started to break and he was open but the past was just a little bit beyond his

of the Washington DC International Post time is 4 p.m. next Saturday Jul say you saw it on CBS Sports now you're looking at the Pittsburgh Steelers in their Huddle's they're hard to beat here let's see open this stadium in 1971 63 and lost only 13 percent at the start of their dynasty here running out of the eye for the first time now Leslie all on her own 21 yard line a 22 yard line that cranks it down the moon down on the 49yard line at feather 27yard one cut one earlier 441 looks like he's on the way to a big day yes he is and of course any time he's healthy he's always capable of having a big day this time but from the iformation he goes back into the pocket and Swan is lined up on the right side comes all the way across the field on a crossing pattern Thierry throws the ball up there beautifully makes the catch great looking playing a great touch on the on the on the pass he laid that in there feathered it too and he didn't just bang it in there do it first down Steelers on there 49 look at all the room on the left side here on lavender but Bradshaw staying with that passing game there it is go wrong and Tenant force taller than he was up then it is a tree in the air by Joe lavender who is the they could tallest quarterback well Mean Joe green over there why I wouldn't want to be a receiver just let me stay in those pit that's a lot quieter well Joe saying it say he doesn't want to go up here and have somebody go to hit him it's a matter of a petty compared to where he plays with all the traffic inside that time lavender et was licked on the play Terry Bradshaw just threw the ball too high over the top to Stallworth Bradshaw has attempted 14 passes and hit eight and he's tripped up across the 50 reached the 45 at the Redskins Karl Lorch the left end took him down Franco Harris that time got a nice block on the outside man that time was provided him with a little Running Room inside but he did a good job or not I have a third down and four Elsie Greenwood left into the Steelers on beef we have 1035 to go to court ten to seven Pittsburgh leading Washington a third and four for the theory the slot right formation and throw the ball here I'm sure one emotional and I blow the whistle too much time now we saw what the play was well designed the Thorton down the middle as illegal delay of the game against the Steelers put the ball back to the 50yard line and make a third down in all right he's got tremendous confidence and poise in his passing ability and the pass protection and the routes that the receivers run if they're very efficient or the most efficient team passing wise in a way love formation third down nine it rush out it goes on the ride it's complete that's Jim Smith we've got the ball he could play first string the most club Sall America third year here what are you gonna do behind stallworth and Swan yeah they put him in on the past obvious passing situation Terry looks to his left rolls to his right and then throws right down the middle this Smith who makes a fine catch in traffic finally tackled there but it's another big down for the Pittsburgh Steelers you talked about Bradshaw when he's right when he wants to run and he's not running my he's right drawing he can dominate a game completely the one quarterback where they can do it all Smith making the hip he's in here tackle now along with Dave but it'll be spotted down on the 27 yard line of the Redskins going out is Pete Wysocki Monty Colvin comes in when the reason this is so tough to rush the pittsburgh steelers is the fact that they trap you so much and your little dubious about the trap and so that's why he is slow down here rush a little bit that first in that last play a first intent situation was a trap with Jerry Mullins trapping the defensive right tackle Byron Talbott Paul Smith has gone out now they start the clock again at the time for that injured player Smith out Lemar perished by the way we've just received word had bruised ribs and has been taken into the Redskin dressing room big rush on Bradshaw when loads at the fort in the gain of the 2015 but before coming as a future star already a star but a another one in the making is out of bounds and his first and goal pittsburgh thornton number 38 goes out at the linebacker he is the option of running outside or inside he ran inside of the linebacker at that time got him turned Monty Coleman and was wide open in the middle did a good job of running down the left sideline and it's another big play for the Pittsburgh Steelers but a good option run by the fine fullback or the halfback I should say Sidney Thornton and an option on the line back first and goal for the status on the redskins seven yard line steelers ahead ten to seven just under nine minutes to play of the birthday at the five on a goal line but a flag went down on a run Franco Harris in the last four games this is holding against Pittsburgher we'll set him back they'll have to go back to the 17 of the Redskins and make it first in 17 for a Steeler touchdown Franco Harris has really been rolling himself the last four games he's gained 431 yards and he's on his way to another thousand yard seasons since he started that thousand yard stuff back in 72 he's missed only one you know as well as he's running good point that you just made he serves a lot of quickness done it this day well what were they saying it he was all washed up there he's lost two steps or something about his uniform beyond what I could give you a shot of the right pants leg of Bradshaw wearing patches areas to pass screen back when his side as Benny Cunningham in for a touchdown they love that plate of Benny Cunningham the big tide almost like a wild when you get the ball go he didn't rolled over people it's very important when you're a quarterback Bradshaw has he rose to his right look at the koi bacon chasing but he stops and he's tall enough to throw the ball over the top you see good blocking downfield on the play by John Kolb and they goes in for the touchdown misdirection screen fast roll right swing back to the left to the tight end Cunningham it went for 17 yards 836 to go on a half and the boot by bars again the passing arm of Bradshaw has taken those dealers right back down the field and so it is 17 to 7 the Steelers out in front you survey where the land is wild and unforgiving a land of desolate beauty few men have seen filling in the empty places on matters that until now have been almost unknown when the Sun retreats from the sky you set your sights for miller.time the best tasting beer you can find Miller High Life America's quality beer C's 1855 if you got the time we got we've got beer but he Hardiman to receive the kickoff Bradshaw incidentally has already over 200 yards completed in this game out to the 15 that tasted and I doubt him on the Rick Moser down the Conrad I've had a couple of 400yard games or maybe more than that two of them by the same gentleman mr. Joe Namath one in the famous Heidi game and Maynard caught 13 in that game and the other was when Namath threw for over 400 yards and Johnny Unitas for 386 yards in the same game but passing for 400 yards is a real hallmark for a quarterback than this National Football League and Bradshaw may do it tonight you know see if they do something to the right here all right and it's over they had a bet him alone and it's in front of but I don't know which man he was going to second downtown iseman 6 out of 14 Ted Frisch goes at a Center Bob Cousy Liz over to the sidelines well one thing is very tough to do against Pittsburgh is to move the ball when he had to play catch up football where's Harlan has replaced John Riggins Winston else's greed would and Jack ham we'll be third down seven to go for the Redskin Pepa bane as Eddie just kicked the 20 yard he'll go after Ricky Bell had plunged one yard for scores Tampa Bay 7 Atlanta 35 to go in the first period and a third and 7 here for the Reds good for the Steelers leading 17% Thomas was normally a quarterback Wayne would back Wagner is out but Thomas have moved to a safety and that's a hardest hit of the day and here at JT Thomas man hitting much Hardiman swings out of the backfield and JT Thomas greedy Gizem a shot high keeps him from falling forward that would have been the first down possibly but he knocked in back into the turf great tackle there by JT Thomas number 24 my Greg will punt again fourth down and a foot the Gothia Bell is a safety man and there buddy Hardiman a real find of this year for the Redskins came in a camp with a free agent won a job right away look good at preseason valuable and running kickoffs punch back coming out of the backfield catching the ball running it down there put allaround player yes he is he certainly is seemingly is alright which is always good to see crowd gives you my hand another sellout here free River Stadium my cry time his average 37yard to kick in the game line them up says the referee and here we go the Redskins really lead the league they do a great job with especially teams covering punts and kickoffs you're right let's call on the two yard line the rescue the peppery kick off the fun allowed the least yardage of any club in the NFL we'll be back in the second period at 17 to 7 Pittsburgh introducing the 1980 Mercury Marquis the Mercury Marquis is not only spacious and comfortable it has 70% better gas mileage ratings than 1975 the 1980 Mercury Marquis come feel how well it's designed if a man's favorite threads prematurely lose their threads and the seams in his slacks seem to disappear then he needs clothes from Levi's sportswear Levi's slacks Blazers and suits hold their great looks because they're sewn to the tough standards that made the Levi's name famous for durability men's clothes from Levi's sportswear where quality never goes out of style next Saturday on the CBS Sports spectacular see the heavyweights in action in the world powerlifting championships plus part two of the battle of the NFL cheerleaders and the conclusion of the World Series of Poker you'll say you saw it on CBS Sports Steelers are first at offense and they're second in the entire league in scoring New England is first in story and Pittsburgh affected business dealers have 219 yards passing from Bradshaw already they've thrown the last three times on first and ten let's see what they do here on first in 1042 they run at this time as Franco Harris he bangs his way to the 50 yard line edged over into the Redskin territory it was tackled by Wysocki and Mark Murphy Pittsburgh on the 50yard line second down and a short two time remaining 6:40 in the first half Franco Harris 34 yards and five carry he's average or point a to carry this year outside I think at 79 make an offside charge try to get back and look like bacon unless they were brought on you know I think it was definitely or your first observation it was a good one kurta I think definitely it was against the Washington Redskins side the Bedford High bacon in his 12th year Jackson State ask him in the lobby today I mean I come here you keep going every year you're up he says hey every year there's four or five young kids coming to camp man I take the money away from they got their hand in his pocket this is oh boy what's that salary we oughta throw here on the first weekend situation let's see if he does the bad pass intended for scholar purpose wine hard Russia at that time Gary Brooks the left tackle an excellent pass Russian was in there from Southern University no the Redskins are starting to play some youngsters now they're very high on a rookie Monty Coleman Sam Huff told me today thinks he's going to be a great linebacker Brooks is in his second year and next year the Redskins in the upset of all upset to go football 2 3 6 draft picks in the first five round I hear they're your own number one I hear they tried to trade him are they jack Curt at the 31yard well how he gets the ball over the top of those linebackers like he does just incredible but he just did it again the Cunningham had pressure coming inside watch him goes back in the pocket throws it right over the top what a battery and receiver it doesn't matter stall response myth Grossman Cunningham rocky players in support a Redskin 30 pick up my stocking tackled Franco Harris there putting ham last year was injured but off to a great start he was a number one draft pick this is his fourth year and this year he stormed away from the starting gate and starry style then was hurt again now he's back playing race got two passes and got a screen for a touchdown six from Pittsburgh 27 yard line to the rescue brookie that's a legitimate hit go for the ball along with number 38 let me Thornton Sidney was running the same option pasady ran priest just a little while ago for a big gain he has the option again as I mentioned earlier to run inside or outside of the linebacker that time he he ran inside again but the ball was deflected and almost intercepted on the play Cunningham is out and Jim Smith goes in to become a third wide receiver the aerial circus is spread out across the field now for his dealers Charlotte come over we intercepted in that Tony Peters pass antenna for Swann Peters has had the last month a vast improvement and he's going to be in there at first team soon and may stay in there for a few years Leakey they got him over from the ground and they're very high on him one of these younger players here is a 45yard field goal by Matt Barr he has picked four out of eight go between forty and forty nine fifty percent from this range and watch it will take over on 28 yard line for the first down remember swine flu and the shots President Ford urged all of us to take you probably thought they were safe so did a lot of other people who today are either dead or crippled watch 60 minutes tonight right after NFL football except on the west coast where it will be run at its regular time 60 minutes following NFL football today Redskin runner 28 with the first time after were slowed down behind the line number 58 Lambert came in to put the pretty Johnny back Lambert that was another counter play it looked like they were going to run to the left he took a step to the left ran to the right check him got penetration forced him inside and Lambert and the rest of those the troops inside made the tackle over four minutes to play there's the rushing average we were talking about earlier store here 1707 Pittsburgh outside spreading back look at that for soup that gang tackle I thought he was going somewhere at that time right yeah but it was a draw play a very delayed draw he looked like he was going to have some Running Room it was a cavity on the left side but by the time he took it try to take advantage of it it was all closed up Bradshaw Jim Smith like ordain shaken up bird down seven Forte will be number 30 play to 4k you agree mobile already blown the blade in Atlanta fourth down and again the skiers Steel Curtain my dad would kick the feel Bell Bragg is making his fifth punt last week Colquitt took nine time this was a good kick 34 and downed immediately on the 38 yard line doghouse went down NFL on CBS regional game the Cardinals in the Redskins next week Tampa Bay Detroit that's where Hank and I'll be the Silverdome in Pontiac Los Angeles and Chicago Minnesota Green Bay San Francisco New Orleans and Atlanta and the New York Giants consultant area our score here 17 to 7 Pittsburgh leading Washington in the conference game first down on the 38 yard line at Pittsburgh goodness thornton thornton and harris coming into this game had combined for eleven hundred and thirtyone yards that's the best rushing tandem of the club in the league Thornton is over 500 yards Harris over 600 and thornton now is limping off they're very high on who's injured Greg Hawthorn we may come in here he's not exactly right they like him Bradshaw said he's very quick and I can get him outside here's the twominute warning no warning he was a man who never danced never sang never performed for an audience yet since 1891 is talent is thrilled millions a little bit all right sir his name was William Tuttle his gift architecture and his masterpiece Carnegie Hall perhaps the only Music Hall in the world where every person in the audience can hear every note no matter how softly it's played mr. O'Reilly here you don't have to shout the same commitment to perfect sound that one of the building Carnegie Hall goes into every high fidelity component pioneer makes that's what's made pioneer number one today with people who care about music pioneer we bring it back alive two minutes to play in the first half Curt Gowdy and Hank Stram William from Three Rivers Stadium there's your score the late tutors in the Steelers scored first Bradshaw passing 11 yards to stall were seven up in first period Riggins ran for a touchdown before yars to tied up 21 yard field goal by five that a 17 yard Bradshaw with honey and pass and that's been it this is a second down and six they have a draw play and maybe had a yard and that's all Franco Harris brought down by koi bacon with a ball on the school 42 yard line he'll have a third down and still six To Go they take Bernie Benny Cunningham out of the game the tight end bring in Jim Smith so you'll have three wide receivers and at the same time a slop to the right with two receivers on the right side and one on the left Smith over here on the left side lavenders covering that that Star Wars Star Wars first down it'll be on the Redskin 48yard line Bradshaw told me hanky says I always thought that Stallworth was as good as one but he just wore subdued they're both great they really are and they run they both have such great hands and the great capacity to spot the open areas and get open which is so important you know Bradshaw right now is up to 242 yards passing in the first half making him more t2 they came off the Buster on the ball hit this afternoon ten days to throw it they call it time to stop the clock he has a tenth of 21 passes he's completed 13 we told you the Steelers are tough to be here there goes Thorton into the locker room while the Steelers are tough at home losing only four games during here the Redskins are no slouches on the road Redskins have won four out of their five road games this year yeah you know and the other thing is so tough when you play Pittsburgh I mentioned it earlier they trap you so much that going into the game you're so concerned about being trapped that you don't rush the passer as well and you don't rush the passer you're really in trouble and the only way you're going to do that then is to shoot linebackers and then you have oneonone coverage and then you're really in trouble that last catch by Stallworth was his 46th of the season and that's a tall kind seasonhigh first down Steelers in the Redskin 48 back again no incomplete that was number 47 ray Wadi was playing in place of the injured Lamar Parrish nearly had it but not quite we've had no turnovers in this game and we've had no sacks a minute four to go and a half second down ten Steelers on the Redskin 48 Steelers all thought they were in for a difficult afternoon because of the Redskins solid type of team and outstanding defense they didn't come in here expecting any breather even though they may have seen not the NFC over six out of six last week and Perry Brooks that time 69 really got good pressure on Terry Bradshaw and made him throw an errant pass again where it is deep the Smith affected by lavender as a ball on the Redskins take over Smith with double team that's the fourth interception to lavender parish leaves the Redskins with 7 Smith didn't do a very good job of trying to come back and knock the ball loose from lavender he should have fought for the ball to knock it loose but he didn't and finally he wound up making the tackle but the damage was already done it was an intercepted pass this is hard for me to believe probably true somebody just handed me a note that Terry Bradshaw has had only one career 300yard passing game I that when I did it that was in the Super Bowl last year in Miami but he all is already about 247 yards in this one people doubt joy they'll throw the ball they get it on guys Keeler's I was about to say the Redskins are not good and they didn't they completed the facet import a fumble now blood picked it up watch this he hit Anderson in a leftfoot what as now blood were recovered and now the steelers has lost the ball with an interception to have a chance to score 44 seconds to go and we've just had our first turnover of the game boy in there something when they last had the ball the Steelers they were on the Redskin 48 now they're on the Redskin 5 and a timeout called by the Redskins they have to let the Steelers out to left Bradshaw an old the Steelers are the only Nash the football league team to start 1979 with all their own players that has been acquired by a traje or free agents a plate for somebody else Dallas began the season with two outside free agent Washington began the season with only 13 in the 45 man a Redskin draft pitch or free agents no each team has gone a different route Steelers believe in home cooking that's worth Carolina but I think you'll see that change right now we have the draft pitch going up yes I'm sure they will and we talked to Bobby better right before the game and were enthusiastic about what might happen in the 1980 Drive most words in airtight in all the doors dealers shooters wire Brad's right up and off it I slip and play they roll to the right Grossman the tight end on the right side look like a block down momentarily over to the left side and a crossing pattern and was wide open on the play Randy Grossman says his greatest play of the Spirit was seeing his picture in a bubblegum card he rides a bicycle by the way to and from practice eller s content of the spinners upland opportunity and they did advantage of it good what a day Terry Bradshaw three touchdown pass 246 yards in passing in the first half major Bowes used to say it around you know it's hard to get that many yard he's in a pregame warmup and fast that's right there's your score 24/7 Pittsburgh the NFL today at halftime right I don't think anybody's still giving him enough to last year guiding that club to 17 out of 19 win in germany was hit high on that kickoff return that fast receiving the dirt bike for days deep these appellate pop the ball up after a pass completion 25 by Tom Green firstyear player for Michigan State as a distinction between a rookie in a firstyear player rookie that was for yard around the poor firstyear player could have come up attendant put on injured reserve is about the season because of an interest hung around the club didn't have a chance to play we have 32 seconds to go in the first half he's not already strong but he's got good speed a lot of people don't realize that he runs at forty and four six in the jet front office got all crossed up over money it's been a good reception of the trade by the Redskins the Redskins had the ball at first down on their 48 yard line 24 seconds remaining build Theismann many think of him as a kid he's nearly 30 years old three years in Canada he was drafted originally by Miami and he very wisely said hey Bob Griese sees there am I going to get to play no Bob Griese is still the number one quarterback there you know we try to get him when I was at Kansas City we try to get him when he came back from the Canadian league but we didn't succeeding succeed in doing it of course and he wound up in Washington up to Canada for three years and set behind Jerguson and how he's a regular he shoots but 2:35 bugs is down there and the Redskin may come in and call timeout whistle blows would have all dead of the first down that the Redskin have left to them here in the first half score would help them they just gave up the score that will be hard to take when they go into that locker room 177 they had intercepted a long Bradshaw pass they'd taken over in their six they completed the short pass it in a fumble and gave the rest give the ball right back again with a game going like it is it's very important for a team to get to get some kind of points before the half it kind of gets you pumped up a little bit and gives you a lot of encouragement and more enthusiasm about what you might be able to do in the second half prior to the 1970 merger the Redskins in the Steelers met 70 times but since the merger they met only once I was in a Monday night game in 1973 the Steelers won at 21 16 first game ever played against together back at 1933 the early day Bob belli directed that goal first down iseman the 30yard line there are 10 seconds remaining move out of there behind that side what's that that he could really move out of there yes sir yes he can especially with somebody chasing him you always thought that was important then you a quarterback that could move yes we always thought it was you know a vital if you're gonna move the Balkans ball away because a quarterback who moves by design creates a lot of problems for the defense I only have ten seconds to go and look like they're gonna try a field goal Faisal was spotted 47 yard attempt that kick is up is no good one of the few of Mosley has missed this year Mosley add the booted 15 out of 19 and it hit five out of seven between 40 and 49 I'm surprised it didn't try another pass they 10 seconds to try another pass and hopefully get a little closer take a shot and then if you make the completion then of course you don't have to kick the ball so far but what's surprising that they try to kick it without trying one more time to get closer Steelers ball our own 34 seconds to go I doubt if they'll play us they think see a Bradshaw I'm a trying to hold one then I get in under 79 bacon to fumble bill loose doesn't make any difference it's the end of the half a half is over a few more seconds than they might have wish they have played it safe there's the end of the first half in three water Stadium

Giants ahead of the Dallas Cowboys on this touchdown pass that we're going to show you Perkins the intended receiver Sims had already thrown one interception at the cowboy 32 yard line Perkins makes a fine catch and then gets into the end zone it was 700 Cowboys with fourth down decided to gamble Staubach went for the pass watch Carson the middle linebacker into the deep zone deflect it away 7 3 third period could be the biggest upset of the day and Tampa Bay heading for the playoffs under John McCain leads Atlanta 7 to 3 Ricky Bell one yard out Pittsburgh dominating Washington the game that

Louis has a field goal from little 42 yards away 3 nothing Bert Jones does it 20 yards to McCall what a different team that is with Jones at quarterback they lead Cincinnati and it was Faust to Lord Jeff 13 yards and a field goal and it was tend another good ol Lord Jeff they can't stop him now James yeah you got a man he said when the Dallas Cowboys arrived in New York late yesterday CBS had a cassette of too tall Jones's belt ready for them to view or cross ass cowboy general manager Tex Schramm his reaction to Jones's debut well it wasn't one of the great fights of the century I don't imagine but I think a lot of people or today are overlooking the fact that it's a it was his first fight just like a first fight of an amateur and I think that the fact that he got through the six round there was a little kind of a stumble I think in a illegal hit at the end but the fact that the judges and felt that he won the fight it's one step further for him and his new career texif too tall decided to come back to football with a Dallas Cowboys taken back we would love nothing better than we'd love nothing better than to have too tall come back to us he left under the finest of circumstances before the draft he came in and told us confidentially that he would not be back so that if that would make any difference we could change our plans he's been very complimentary to our football team and if the boxing does not ever work out for him he'll be very welcome with the Cowboys they could use him this afternoon let's go alive to the Meadowlands the rookie Phil Simms has the Giants on the move again from the sidelines they watched the handoff as they power right straight ahead and the Giants have been dominating the Cowboys at the line of scrimmage as Tom Landry indicated during the week it was going to be extremely difficult to get back up after losing that emotional game to the Pittsburgh Steelers and of course they had to stay on the road no doubt about you know I was surprised to hear Landry say that though Brent you know but when you talk about what Sims gut gives to the New York Giants he'll some of the players in the locker room the other day when I was over there said that you know we thought our ace was out when the Rams knocked him out of the ball game last week one over the sideline six of smelling salts came back and threw a touchdown pass for us this guy is tough you're second at eight now for Simms and the rookie for Morehead State content now to hand it off to Taylor and their power and right straight ahead they have left in with a passing situation here and down at about the Dallas 25yard line so the next play we will watch Sims go up to the air right straight ahead this was the series that ignited the Giants four weeks ago against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers they simply ran it down the Buccaneers throats Sims with the play in from the sidelines Perkins has sent it in Brad Van Pelt number 10 watching for the sidelines the Giants had a great goal line stand I showed you the last play now it is third and five and Sims checks that cowboy defense can the young man do it again under pusher throws it in the air and it's incomplete so Perkins was covered Sims was hurried and they had to throw it out of bounds so now they'll bring on Dinello and they will attempt a field goal you watch and a cowboy's of course went to the Blitz you could see Harris number 43 storm in from the side so the Cowboys again demonstrating they do not have as good a rush as they had before it is 73 the Giants leading Dallas will stay right here with this field goal and then we will go for a station break and come back and show you the toprated college quarterbacks according to the pro scouts that's coming up donello needs a strong leg it looks accurate off to the side off to the side no good so it'll stay at 7 3 and the NFL today will continue on CBS after these messages from your local stations Teddy Kennedy will his past affect his future a look at the public figure and the private man as CBS reports Teddy Sunday at 10:00 9:00 central and mountain this is CBS if you want to borrow money you know and Union National Bank knows that it isn't one of life's great pleasures and no musical background makes borrowing money joyous adventure but if you need a loan a personal loan mortgage loan or business loan Union National is a good place to go not because it's fun or easy but because it's Union Nationals business to lend money when it's needed we want to be the bank you come to when you need a bank I'm Terry Bradshaw and I hate to run but not running is worse so if I've got to run it's going to be in the most comfortable shoes I can find Spalding they do for my feet what the Pittsburgh receivers have done for my arm all that way first wrongs don't surprise me none Kate Jackson joins Mike Douglas Monday at 4:30 according to the pro scouts the top quarterback in college football who was a senior is a young man by the name of Mark Wilson out of unbeaten Brigham Young University no question they drool about this young man's size he stands 6 5 it's not an arm that's a howitzer that he turns loose the only question about Wilson according to the scouts is whether or not he can stand up to the pressure of a fierce passrush the Brigham Young offensive line has given Wilson all the time that he needs and Mark simply stands in there and does the rest with one bomb after another he replaced the talented Gifford Neilson number two but only a sophomore according to the post Kautz archly ster out of Ohio State they liked art because besides being a good passer he's a talented runner and there's simply no question about his arm he's also a basketball player at Ohio State a senior out of Arizona State is Mark Malone the scouts say he is the premier running quarterback this year watch against Utah State from the to a crushing block at the line of scrimmage Malone gets outside and scores on this 98 yard touchdown run the best jr. according to the scouts is Marc Herrmann out of Purdue Herrmann possesses the one thing that Scouts demand the NFL the quick release you get sometimes less than three seconds and by that time you've got to have released the ball in the NFL now the smartest of all the quarterbacks and also a senior is Paul McDonald from USC there is one question that scouts have about this young man or resembles Stabler whether or not he has a strong enough arm such as the howitzer that Wilson has there's no question he knows how to hit the receiver just when he needs the ball and there is a freshman who has appeared on the scene at Pittsburgh Danny Marino but he also is a talented baseball player and he's going to have to select between the two sports now speaking of young quarterbacks with strong arms let me show you Doug Williams from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as you know the Buccaneers apparently are gonna go to the playoffs they are dominating the NFC Central and watch this shotgun deep drop there it goes cameraman can't even find it and threw it out of his range Rickey Bell and bounced in for the Bucs touchdown Williams favorite target on the Bucks is Isaac Higgins this time Higgins cuffs it up Pridemore picks up the fumble but Atlanta had to settle for a field goal by machete is their offense bogged down against that talented defense and so it is still 7 to 3 let's send you back now to Curt Gowdy and Hank Stram and there's the halftime score and it's been a passing show by Terry Bradshaw that we'll be talking about later the score again the Pittsburgh Steelers 24 and the Washington Redskins 7 I'd like to talk to you about the Sony Betamax and an incredible feature called beta scan I'm John Williams senior and if you know Genesis you know my son he's a cassette of his last Championship match made a scan lets me go fast forward in Reverse so I can skip the boring stuff like this long rally and stop when I come to the real exciting parts like Tom jr. here dashing onto the court to pick up the ball isn't that a match terrific I'd let you see what you've been missing and miss what you don't want to see it's from Sony that one and only I never worry about what brand name part my mechanic puts on my car that doesn't make me a bad guy I go to a professional mechanic I can trust so I trust the parts he uses he uses Mopar it means nothing to me but it means a lot to him Mopar fits all americanmade cars foreign cars too and they're used by professional mechanics all over the world if the professional trusts Mopar I trust Mopar does he make me happy he makes it his business trust your car Mopar hi I'm John Riggins the Washington Redskin and this is my mother Mildred a very brave and determined woman we're here at the YWCA where the United Way supports a program to help rehabilitate women who have had mastectomy Bob why don't you tell them your story let's go ahead and John and I'll tell you about it when I had my mastectomy they didn't have a program like this so I volunteered my services to help other women there are specially designed exercises and discussion groups volunteers help provide the physical and emotional support these women need to feel whole again it's so important to have someone who cares a lot of volunteers just like my mom make this program work thanks to them the United Way works here in Washington and it works in your town too thanks to you it works for all of us the United Way right mom right three sitting announcements furnished to the public service by the National Football League 24/7 Steelers ahead but the story of this game is the passing of Terry Bradshaw who's on his way Hank to his alltime first kohai in a Steeler uniform yes he's completed 14 of 25 for a very impressive 246 yards they came off the bus throwing the football Kurt as you know and I'm sure we're going to see a lot more passing in the second half three touchdown passes for the kickoff second half let's go down the pit and we are lads the Redskins are going to kick it off 318 yards in a game is the high for Bradshaw in his career and that was in last January Super Bowl this is Larry Anderson whose deep twenty four to seven as we begin the second half this bird you know throwing the surprising ease today they stated sideline it'll be a touchback first down Pittsburgh Bradshaw is high in a regular season game in his tenure career has been 291 yards 2:46 in the first half you know he hasn't had to throw that much in the past and hasn't had any 300 yard games because they've always run the ball so what so well Kurt but they're throwing the ball extremely well here this afternoon there's a story behind that wire and Franco Harris in the back Thornton I believe injured his ankle nuts Rocky Bleier out of bounds on the 24 yard line and reducing number 59 drove him out the Steelers were a ball control running team then 7778 they switched over to a passing team more this year to a ball control running team up until today today they've been the aerial circus out here but they've got a lot of confidence in their passing game and of course as you mentioned they used to take the bus to where they wanted to go now they're taking the jet second down six well the Redskins are a solid defensive team they're not easy to run again Bradshaw Johnson much work Jones at Baltimore head he's a small looking back although he weighs 210 a very compact 210 not very tall 511 big player here in his teamleading the blocking for Harris running the ball he inherits one year combined for a thousand yards of piece and Rocky's average 6 yards of carry this year but gradually they move Thornton ahead of him and use Blair's hurry first down Pittsburgh on there 33 the only ran for 52 yards in the first half running games some in the second half the game is blyer we stopped at the 35 yard to yard gain day buts stopping him there second down eight this is Curt Goudy Hank Stram we have just opened the third quarter here in Pittsburgh twenty four to seven the Steelers in the lead or in the first minute of play of the second half this would be a good time for a drawer some kind of a trip occurred because they are going after it pass is incomplete it was being covered in an attendant for Cunningham was covered by Mark Murphy a thirdyear player out of Colgate safety man well that was another bad looking pattern the tight in and the flanker were very close together put her shaken hands under the right now they were right there together going out there's Carl larch Joe Jones comes in to rush pass rusher third and eight for this dealer he's done it what if this still going that way kids but in conjunction with that the great presents watch she was back into the pocket delivers a strike to Stallworth right between two defensive backs the ball was deflected he caught it maintained concentration took off right down the middle for the goal post and he goes into the end zone and changes the scoreboard a beautiful play Bradshaw has broken a couple of his own record the first time he's ever thrown four touchdown passes game and his tenure Carrera the yards of the ad now get coming up that's good and the Steelers are for the score Pittsburgh 31 and Washington seven American business is being taken over by revolutionaries revolutionary seven copiers sevens advancing in New York

hundred and twentysix yards receiving in this game six catches that ties a careerhigh for him we've entered a game with 41 catches now he's got 47 of course he leaves NFL the most yard E hasn't hurt himself Riggins pilot the 30 the Redskins have done nothing running the ball against this very strong Steel Curtain defense you know they're a few passes on first down to Kurt you know I'm surprised that they don't haven't tried to throw some playaction on earlier down has proved ik the backup quarterback no hole that little smile on his foot he will say son you want to get I like us in rap song go for 400 yards these coaches don't care about that talk to Hank about suck it down hey guys it's inflate out of balance to McDaniel what about it you ever take a player who records into account if your way out of the game no not really and truly the the only thing that really is important is you win the football game and during the process if you could establish some records that's fine but I don't think you try to intentionally try to establish records by helping the individual stats of one player aniseh just passed 67 yards to Isaac Curtis famous battery out there Ryan land 14 to 7
