  "transcript": "a horse the Lombardi Trophy the Cowboys and the Packers Aaron Rodgers coming off of that week where we didn't won't know about the tear in his leg and Dez Bryant sleeve this warming up prior to a game it wasn't as cold as we thought it would be it wasn't ice ball conditions it was cold but it was a nice bowl condition he's eccentric Rodgers look pretty nimble on this first touchdown pass the day I almost say he look pretty nimble but he moved around I hit that play done and that's what was so incredible about Aaron Rodgers that he did not look like well this old Aaron Rodgers but he's still gutted out of great yeah he hopped on on the one good leg a couple times to get that ball to Andrew parlous to start the scoring but we're all marched down the field and then in the end zone Terrance Williams is contacted so its first and goal and why not what after when you're on they'll go on and you've got DeMarco Murray and your backfield of course you're gonna go to the leading rusher this year no but it's a it's tiny o'clock everybody listen Green Bay they have been selling it out on short yardage to go live and listen DeMarco was getting some tough first downs that was the easy call to see this Cowboys are playing klutz balls roll moment it's 700 second quarter called Eddie Lacy on the sideline after he was the one that got the boy the Packers down the field in the first quarter he was on the sideline when Alan Rogers is slinging it over the head of everybody not looking comfortable in that pocket and the calf began to tighten up on him it appeared in the second quarter of this game it's a lot of time bleh Rodgers got the hottest nap to him when he wasn't expecting it in Jeremy Mincey knocks the ball loose and hops on top of it this time he has to pick up the ball throw the ball get sacked and fumble it again this is unlike Aaron Rodgers the bad play that started he should have just threw the ball away lived to see another play so the Cowboys get that turnover and try to turn it into points and Terrance Williams does that but the run after the catch serve you called it he showed up big to this my expected you know we had to come up and make place he was going to get some oneonone opportunities with Green Bay selling out to stop the run and keeping the safety over top to stop this brought evens the bag that's a hard tag become a flash come on Williams the defensive tackle on a 38yard touchdown their Cowboys a 147 the ball goes out off of Jordy Nelson's hands on a is jority and the Cowboys forced the Packers to punt the football Harmon Straub stalls right there well that's allow boys drive with less than a minute to go in the half there is Jason Witten the BFF getting the first down even though he didn't even sneak through the first down line the Cowboys called timeout after that in the timeout a proper review took place any proper replacement of the ball almost the full two yards back from where it was fought it took place and then on a third one and a bad snap forces of throw away and then you bring on one of the most surefooted kickers in the entire league all year long and Dan Bailey comes out and a huge sequence run there at the end of the first actually miss two straight because he can't afford it oh that that yeah that gave good field position to Aaron Rodgers who made a bad throw Randall Cobb to set up a field goal of Green Bay's own right before the half and that is how Green Bay got within four points before the end of the half and you can see Rogers I'm skipping and jumping down the field through the quarter Tony Romo and the Cowboys come out I guess thumbs DeMarco Murray wins going hey that was a touchdown I just want you guys able caught them in the perfect defense they ran the perfect play that save deep does not have a chance on DeMarco Murray oh no blue field that's a touchdown Julius Peppers though makes the play jumps Adam gets the ball loose instead of a touchdown for Dallas it's a turnover for Green Bay and here's Eddie Lacy but it was a leading the charge down the field that rookie hurt quite the quite the day great blocks by Kuhn and Adams right there two plays later Rodgers completes it to Adams but at the end of the play after forward progress was stopped according to the officials on the field TJ Klein called for unnecessary roughness to green at this point yeah that's just just excessive they want to clean that up Miami's used to go and clean up the pile guys around trying to make the tackle in the road but I think they also need to stop the defenders going out there play football today 15yard penalty is what moved the Packers back from a third and short situation had to settle for a field goal it's a onepoint game as Romo finds Whitman for 15 yards he's shaken up on the play hit by mica high Romo stays in the game next play onepoint game from the Packers 27 and here comes 29 for 26 yards turn it turn it right down the field oh haha robo after the handoff and it doesn't matter if you've got I guess DeMarco Murray running like that and when you're in first and goal for one it's time to clutch time to make a block touchdown DeMarco Murray a year hold Jews tempers but 25 carry ain't kept them in buck 23 for DeMarco Murray it was a left hand injury to for all two banged up he's staying in the game ensuing Packers possession your time can't stop over the middle now he sharp his third quarter and Rodgers who had practice for two weeks now look at me walking better he's ready now Thursday until the replace later it's don't sell out and die for that one man 21 21 point lead with a minute 41 left in the third quarter in gotta shoot worth quarter ego on it's a fourth quarter that we talked about for quite some time because of a fourth down play that's soon to come 2120 Tony Romo first play of the fourth quarter doesn't get rid of it takes a sack Cowboys punt two plays later the Packers getting the ball back the ensuing drive their own 35 second at eight Rodgers to that rookie Adams again who makes a play again tackle man come to me please okay we talked about it all season he's going to step up that other guy besides cognizant Adam said it is I and that's cop out of the backfield two plays after that Adams catch 214 yards three plays later Aaron Rodgers in the red zone with a rhythm Rodgers to the other Rodgers saves it to Richard does this he was convinced to throw on us that seems like the old smooth throw with the tire you tore across the entire that's it double check solid like that this is grown man quarterback in right a twopoint conversion fails it's a 5point game third and 11 for Romo over the middle it's Beasley he's short he is short it's it's five and half to go its fourth down so what are the Cowboys do they go up top to their Beast and hope he makes a play he does it's ruled a touchdown article have mine for the Dallas Cowboys but McCarthy's gonna challenge it and Bryan goes down to the ground and a quarter Nadeem Blandino going to the ground by rule he must hold onto it throughout the entire process of contact in the ground he didn't so it is incomplete and after further review take that off the board take the ball and put it back in the hands of Rodgers to find Davante Adams on third and three time and time outs are running out for the Dallas Cowboys 26 to 21 is the school trustee Balzer yeah very great plays each time one more third and long the Cowboys need to stop after the twominute warning and even though the ball is still in the hands of calm for a game sealing NFC divisional Sunday sealing Lambeau Field victory for Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers is Dez Bryant and Tony Romo and DeMarco Murray's fantastic 2014 season ends in Lambeau Field in the divisional round and it is the Green Bay Packers going back to the NFC Championship game for the first time in four years keeping the Cowboys winless on a divisional weekend still since Michael Irvin's last Super Bowl season of 1995 of course the conversation after the game in the in the Twitterverse on social media and it will be all day on Monday on sports talk radio the Dez Bryant catch

  "transcript": "all over twice the Raiders once but look at the total yard numbers 283 for Denver just 82 total yards in the first half for the Raiders Greg Gumbel along with Trent Green so the Raiders get the ball first in the second half by virtue of having deferred after winning the toss what do you expect them to come out with well first they have to get the ball movie they had eight possessions five of those eight possessions were three knots they need to get first down so you have to get the run game going a little bit that hasn't been their strength this year get the playaction pass get Derrick pop derrick karr on the move get him outside he's been under pressure these last few series get him outside the pocket work and make some plays with his feet and push the ball up the field it would seem that a good start to the second half would be imperative for the Raiders let's check in with Evan Washburn downstairs Evan well Greg that was exactly the message from Tony Sparano when I spoke to them it all starts with the offense he understands the margin for error is so slim when you're playing Cate Manning also spoke with John Fox he felt the difference was that they just settled down they started executing especially the offensive line figured out what the Raiders were doing up front batting out all those passes really thought that that CJ Anderson play obviously changed momentum but for the Raiders it all starts and ends offensively according to Sparano all right Evan thank you the kick through the end zone and Raiders will start near here some penalty markers flying several of them that's the guy who caught the personal foul unnecessary roughness number 57 of the receiving team half the distance to the goal first down well that's rayray Armstrong a linebacker and that is probably what what Tony Sparano did not need yeah when you come out the balls I the end zone get the ball the 20 now of a sudden you're back at the 10 and 57 right here he's going to get the late hit he's coming over and this is where the hits gonna be on and no need for it no return so now car and the reader starting from there straight ahead darren mcfadden eight possessions in the first half for the readers and five three and outs and then all of a sudden again you're gonna get a personal file to move them back even more so not doing yourself any favors on 2nd and 8th the quick slap that doesn't work pass intended for James Jones covered by Bradley Roby and a 38 ruby is climbing all over Jones is back you can see why the Raiders sideline was looking for a penalty no penalty Stan's a good break up good defense here sideline of shuriken if any portion Eloise we talked about coming into this game they were fit in the secondaries then they had a couple guys banged up in the first half they were able to return but dippers not the team who won't be banged up in the second year just because heavy weapons am far under pressure pushes it out to a lineman Khalif Barnes the ball is loose and is down at about the 17 yard line covered by Chris Harris of the Broncos so it's going to be an illegal forward pass but then if your alignment all of a sudden you're running with the ball do you see him he's swinging it with one arm I mean it was you know just just secure it illegal touching number 69 of the offense that player subsequently fumbled the ball and that was recovered by the defense that penalty is there for decline first down Denver that is disaster right off the bat so this is where it's going to have half happen it's going to be carful i guess i guess it was the left guard it wasn't the right guard so yeah it was it was Barnes and he caught the ball and he tried after he's running up the field he tries making a move with it which sometimes it's good to know your limitations watch this he swings the ball out to the right and tries making a cut and a stiff arm and everything else it's I'm just gonna take a guess and say that didn't come out of the offensive playbook yeah that's uh he had flashbacks maybe to his youth days when he was a well it was a running back not the type of start to the second half the Raiders were looking for so from the 18yard line man setup click pass to the nearside Emmanuel Sanders to the 13th late flag comes in Karl Jeff retired in the past number 64 offense was illegally downfield by VR penalty vp first down that's Center will Montgomery so Derek Carr what happened on that is the rookie just appears panicking through all the any black jersey that he saw well as you're going down and knowing you're inside your own 10yard line he's trying to get it out of his hands his flip and make a play and as you said Greg equipment in offense to do is just take it bat it down becomes an incomplete pass but that's not something you let's I'd run out about shy of the tree apply my seal ward you know it's one thing it's one thing if a quarterback sees someone out of the corner of his eye it's it's quite another one an offensive lineman knows he's not an intended receiver we looked at it you see me caught the ball he looked at it like okay what I do I guess I better take off from him so once he caught it and realized that he shouldn't have the ball in his hands and no choice other other than to go down second and 13 and rubber band out of bounds at about the 10yard line all the wars and Larry asada converging that's Asante and the 42 the third year he comes back out of the breast burden Tina the Ritter's have been good at this part of the field as far as stopping dipper on supports feeble attempts towards McCain many changing things we got one on one down there the bottom of the screen with Julie looking that way throwing on the sweat Thomas touchdown Denver you know a lot of times with Maine Manning's doing all that stuff in the line of scrimmage a lot of it is just for the defense it's not even doing anything for the offense all he's trying to do is to get the defense to commit and here at the bottom of the screen you see number 80 we pointed it out it just gets a slant route there's clear routes on the inside defensive players to be yelling for Sanders on a picker out there but mantoman coverage Manning was able to recognize that knew where the matchup was that he wanted to take advantage of when we talked with Julius Thomas last night he quite possibly was the happiest guy we talked to all weekend long wonder if he knew it was coming Julius Thomas Izzy Levin touchdown catch of the year 27 10 all of those number 80 Julius Thomas jerseys that's the Julius Thomas contingent from nearby Stockton California celebrating numberings touchdown catch twenty seven to ten Denver and the TV is boring in one this yards deep across the 20m to the 25yard line go back to the touchdown we got one swell Cougars gonna going to be on the inside he's just gonna run a corner routes to get out of the way Saunders it's gonna Sanders is gonna come up here and get in the way so the defender runs into him and then you got this the underneath route by Julius Thomas you see Sanders he just gets in the way it he's not going up and blocking him he's just getting in the way the defender being able to follow him through and then here you go peeps a little flip in there he was the family touchdown ball right there nowhere Chris Harris teeny first women on Jackson's Thomas I'm saying before we went to commercial trittyes he's the happiest guy we talked to all week as the jolly big guy and hey I'm all for guys that big being jolly well and he had talked some it wasn't necessarily his frustration but he talked about the last couple games how offensively they hadn't gotten involved in the game plans early because he is sentient but an X Factor from an offensive standpoint Howard defense is going to match up on it and he said they were utilizing it's only didn't get him involved as well that pass is complete out to about the 29 yard line to Marcel you know sometimes you needed to to throw a little chip block and if we need a little extra protection that's me and he kind of felt left out on occasion and he did he said just like anybody you want to be involved in the game plan early you just you know he used the word antsy he said you start going through the game you don't get the ball initially you get a little antsy wanting to get the ball and he felt the last couple weeks he hadn't been you know getting that ball earlier today he's taking for the van car throwing down middle of the field and that's incomplete intended for Denarius more running away we talked about it the first half eight possessions five three and outs they come out here the first possession they get the turnover they have to turn over the second possession is a three and out so offensively just having struggling so far today I haven't even told 90 yards of total offense the points coming off of Denver's time a lot of that came early though you're right in bed and it also when you have those kind of the touch lines you're going to draw more attention to what the defense is one might say at first not gonna advance past the 30yard line and we have penalty markers down back upfield during the kick holding number 52 receiving team after distance to the goal first down hi mom Nelson is guilty of the whole so battles back the Broncos up Broncos and Raiders great games great bases great numbers great football during the year the NFL on CBS is sponsored by Southwest Airlines book your low fare now at southwest.com Kay Jewelers every kiss begins with Kay and buy the allnew 2015 Acura TLX it's that kind of thrill back in Oakland manning in the broncos from their own 19 yard line seven to ten wait Victor dolmen complete and bounds Demaryius Thomas hey tonight 60 minutes goes to the Ebola hot zone to see how the Americans fighting the outbreak are doing Plus actor Steve Carell tonight only CBS in Oakland today executive vice president football operations and general manager John Elway apparently support racket is dead I see a war it would seem if these Raiders are gonna get a spark it's gonna have to come from the defense it is it and then the linebackers we touched on that early in the game for the young linebackers flying around the field here's co more right here he's gonna come through and make the tackle I stopped my tuck at the point of attack occupying two offensive players and giving a lame Percy Lorna get in the backfield and come up with a big stop they've got to find a way to just stop Peyton Manning early and rise and get the ball back second and 13 hilarious across the 40 tripped up by Larry Asante let's look a little bit about what peyton manning that the first interception of the game he threw into triple coverage here you get isolated at the top of your screen just on a quick wide receiver screen but Peyton Manning after that first interception trying to push the ball up the field into coverage he's really settled down he's had a lot of quick throws and then when he's had the oneonone the touchdown to Emmanuel Sanders down the sideline the touchdown to Julius Thomas he's been able to take advantage of the oneonones and really getting the ball out of his hands nicely since the beginning it again this is CJ Anderson with Running Room across midfield and close to the 40 yard line they'll mark him down at the 41 derrick karr can only look on and wish for the football CJ entus ins had himself a day with Monty ball mount play today Ronnie Hillman getting dinged up a little bit eat a good job running the football six care in 68 yards give you good balance that often play clock now 35 on the snap here mr. Anderson Anderson about the 37 yard line and Manning now looking like he can pick and choose because most everything he's doing is working well and you do when you have the things going offensively the way they are you have to lead the 17 point lead and the deep it's unbalanced plus you know the defense has lost a little sparkly you know you start punching in the mouth a few times get in the end zone that things aren't working squishing those missed tackles that happen earlier right before the half it really does take a punch to the gut to the defense was very dialed in on house level watch the attack whistles down at the 35 by Kahlil neck we have markers down on the field trippin number 84 offense 10yard penalty repeat second down Jacob Tamme the tight end guilty there so Khalil Mack was one able to get in on the play he gets up field but he's able to come off and make the tackle he gets good pressure and he's able to shed the block and come off and do nice stab with that you can understand why the Raiders are excited about him the talent that he brings the speed that he brings is probably the best people to clear well you know that's a lot of people don't recognize the quarterback hurries are the pressures up the field when you get up the field and you make the money back cut back in where the guys make the tackle really he's been able to do a lot of those things on second and 16 on the back the sidelines and constant Audubon's just about the 40yard line my to roam around one second and long the Raiders drop their coverage and rally couldn't make that tackle early rush for far sideline man is complete to Demaryius Thomas and Thomas a five let's talk about a half yard here in the first down well this is that range where you go for it on fourth down and they are up to the line in a hurry many quick snap gonna keep it and throw it and complete it to 20 Julius Thomas to the endzone for the touchdown three Peyton Manning his fourth touchdown pass of this game well this one's going to be on the veteran Charles Woodson he's lined up over Julius Thomas he's right here and Thomas is going to come leak it out into the flat he bites down just that one step that one hard step he's able to jump up and try and get the tip pass but the height of Julius Thomas and the touch the paint man it puts on the football there's no chance there there's nobody left home to make that tackle extra point is good and with 652 to play in the third quarter the Broncos the head of steam a Phaeton manning's last nine passes he's completed all nine four of them for touchdown two of them to number 80 I'd say settle down after those perceptions they did rather than two months let's say B is worried let's not shop across the 15 to about the 18 yard line 645 to play in the third a beautiful look at the Bay Bridge it's not all it's beautiful for the Raiders so far the NFL on CBS is sponsored by KFC the world's best chicken how do you KFC and by Geico 15 minutes could save you 15% or more on car insurance welcome back on first down from the 18 yard line Derek Carr in the in Oakland offense looking for any kind of a spot gonna go deep into coverage incomplete one Raider for DB's downfield Vincent Brown the intended receiver Terrance Knighton is able to get pressure up the middle and Derek Carr is going to take a shot you watch Knight and he's coming right up the middle and as he steps into the throw as their car steps into the throw he's gonna get take right in the ribs tonight this is Marcel Reece and Reis pushing and being pushed across the 22 about the 21 yard line and as a quarterback when you take that kind of a shot it really just takes the wind out of you and causes those roots to expand a little bit if not break so tough guy Derek Carr being able to deal with that jump right back up get after it latavius Murray in the backfield now on 37 and here come the Broncos and down he goes and that's von Miller and we have a parisa hands hands to the face number 29 defense fiveyard penalty automatic first down so Bradley Roby's penalty just negates would Von Miller accomplished and it's a first down for the Raiders Tom Miller right in the middle your screen 58 comes on the spin move you're gonna see him now this is after the spin move but he's able to gosh he's able to get right across Barnes space we showed it earlier in the game that spin move has been so effective for him Marie across the 32 about the 33 32 33 yard line Brandon Marshall winning tackle only five first downs all day for the Oakland Raiders and really right now that's what you have to try to eat you just need to try and get some first time get something positive get get it going for next week first down skid in scoring position just do some positive things from an offenses either sitting here at a hundred yards halfway through the third Jones and that looks like that'll be enough for a first down your reminder for you week test continues with the Bears and the Packers on Sunday Night Football on NBC and tomorrow for the Panthers and Eagle on Monday Night Football on ESPN too far for Jones to reach it's kind of been that type of day for the Raiders so far offensively that time having a shot up the field and just off his fingertips there's been a few plays where they've just a few inches away see the safety coming over to the top you got to try and hit that there's a void along the sidelines when you've got to cover to looks where you get that ball in there and putting cargo coming over the top for the Bronco so second and ten freshness to the tightend Michael Rivera you're talking about Newton trying to get some momentum going if not for the rest of today but certainly for the coming weeks in the next two weeks Oakland plays the other two divisional rivals they travel to San Diego next week then they host the Kansas City Chiefs the week after yeah it doesn't get any easier for Matt they have you know one of the toughest if not the toughest schedule remain out on their run who they have coming up so it's it doesn't get any easier and as you say Greg we just need to Ritter just need to get something dirty buddies intercepted by TJ more TJ more let's see if they mark him out of bounds back upfield right now he's being marked out inside the 15yard line the Raiders say it was a lot sooner than that but TJ Ward with his first interception of the season Missy TJ wore number 43 on the right side of your screen that ball just comes out too low from deer bound yep here Carr throws that ball too low you got to place it up higher and the penalty touch and the challenge flag has been thrown by Tony Sparano there's the foot out of bounds on Oakland for throwing a flag challenge flag when they are not able to do so that will cost them their first charge timeout so the automatic review superseded by Tony Sparano flag and he got called for it Carl Jeffers with the decision after review the defender did intercept but stepped out of bounds at the 34 yard line it will be Denver's ball first and ten at that spot the Raiders are charged with their first timeout for throwing the challenge flag when they're not able to do so that's a coach just forgetting that the play is going to automatically be reviewed yeah really what you need to do if you want to challenge it is it's called the timeout which they're going to give you the timeout back when they go to review it other than the review in the booth that when they go to review it on the sidelines their game fought for three and fifty three five zero please so we're going to adjust the game clock which I xx feeling can't move fast enough for the Oakland Raiders for a day down the near sideline it is incomplete DJ Haydon covering Demaryius Thomas this is a similar play that they got the touchdown earlier to Emmanuel Sanders DJ hatin getting beat down the right sideline this time to Marius Thomas is matched up and Aiden is able to stay with them and get his head turned around and nearly comes up with the interception DJ haters played very well today second and ten adding rolling that's complete to Thomas Thomas inside 25 to about the 2003 incidentally we are told that mental aquatic offensive lineman for the readers has gone to the bottom in degrees so a new set of downs at the 23yard line for Manning in the Bronco Anderson it takes the hit inside 22 the 18 yard line Demaryius Thomas a bad day for the sixth straight game a hundred receiving yards the eighth player in NFL history with six straight such games in a single season you can see him closing in Calvin Johnson has the NFL record with eight straight games so a couple games away is what look at the weapons that pigmented as it has at his disposal all been getting involved in it that quick pass to Emanuel Sanders and that will be enough for a first down DJ Hayden came off the field a short while ago and has not returned first down at the 12th and whistles and movement on the offensive line false start number 74 offense fiveyard penalty second down second call today on our land Oh Franklin and Greg that's the that's the third offensive procedure call that they've had and it's very uncharacteristic for this offense to have procedural issues I know there's been a reshuffling on the offensive line but it's a it's a group of veteran guys that generally that doesn't happen when you saw Hayden being looked at on the sidelines Nikko fort was in for him first and 15 flipping into an person and thought about sort of the 15 yard line by Larry Asante in CJ Anderson limping on the sideline and Juwan Thompson replaces him second 13 fortythree passing attempts banning today number 44 over the middle ends off touchdown Sanders five touchdown passes on the day for Peyton Manning I just got to talking about the weapons that Peyton Manning that has at his disposal in the way as a defense you know which one are you going to cover which one are you going to doubleteam and it makes it rips up for defense to determine that one on one to play in the third quarter Sanders going down the middle but you got two defenders over here because you got Julius Thomas up top you got Demaryius Thomas going out wide here so who are you going to cover it right here Charles Woodson gets a little wide and allows the middle of the field to get open and paint Manning recognizes it and when you have that many weapons at the disposal like peyton manning does how are you going to defend that who are you going to run with and that's why they've been effective with the running game so far today denver has been running the ball very effectively with CJ anderson eight carries for 77 yards and when you're able to balance it with the running the pass and then you're able to get those guys up the field it it really puts the defense in a tough spot I thought it was really interesting and again we've referenced it earlier the attitude that Peyton had when he came into our meeting he he spent his week refocusing himself and his offense because they didn't only didn't at all like what happened at New England last week and he gave a lot of credit to New England and he gave a lot of credit to them defensively and we said what would you you know going back and looking at it were you you brought this up to him he said were you a little hard on yourself in your post game comments he said not at all I didn't play well enough I was disappointed with with how I handled it and you know give New England credit for the game playing they had he's it just like we touched on earlier in the game very focused about what went on last week and how he wanted to play the game he came out pressing a little bit at least I thought he did miss miss with that burst of perception throwing it into triple coverage but he's since called down and obviously in you know with 44 pass attempts and 31 completions he's uh Peyton Manning what we expected hey next Sunday the NFL on CBS features regional games including these Broncos traveling to st. Louis to meet the Rams also the Bengals visit the Saints Trent na will be down in New Orleans for that one of the Raiders face the Chargers all begins at noon Eastern Time JB in company on the NFL today that's all next Sunday here on CBS dispatch the studio are having way too much fun way too much fat a minute one second remaining car it as he was throwing incomplete let's check in with Evan downstairs well guys to injury updates to fill you in on Melek Watson you saw him head in the locker room the right tackle is being evaluated for a concussion DJ Mason came to the sidelines slammed his helmet down is in a ton of discomfort it's his left groin they're listing them as a question returned this is a player who's dealt with a ton of injuries over the cork students career thanks Evan and as we said has played very well today second and ten on the quick slant popped up in the air almost intercepted Brandon Marshall almost got his hands on it couldn't quite reach him who can be 30 chen the slant on the outside and a keep to lead with the collision we haven't brought up and keep the league's name very often today that may be the first time i've talked about him all day this they haven't been able to get the ball to that side of the field and defensively the pressure than they've been applying to Derek Carr and causing them to throw a lot of crossing routes underneath 30:10 their car now displaying it on every down throwing far side of the field dive incomplete writes butler couldn't come up with it and it'll be another punch for the raiders i start wandering if you're if you're denver at what point time do you put Brock Osweiler in the game and start getting him some work peyton manning already five touchdown passes on the day we saw that last series where Peyton took a pretty big shot he put Brock Osweiler in immediately future nice kicked by King Isaiah verse here Kent called Warren made at about the 26 yard line and from on high once again our aerial coverage today being provided by MetLife a beautiful scene just not a great outcome for the Oakland Raiders and their fans yeah we came rolling in this morning there was quite a few people out there tailgating getting ready to go the smoke was lifting up through the parking lot there was some excitement this rivalry is it is a story traditional rivalry and with the way this game started getting a couple of quick turnovers getting the ten points there in the first first part of the game you know we thought we had this ourselves a really good game there in the beginning well if the tailgate doesn't know the losing streak does it so from their own 26yard line manning still at Corvette and they give us the CJ Anderson just a little while ago Brock Osweiler the thirdyear quarterback kind of had a hunch he was gonna get into the game and he's kind of wrong uh yeah the smile on his face you see if he took the hat off he was excited here I get to go Brock Osweiler is old for one throwing the football this season I got a feeling when he gets in there he's really not gonna throw it anyway so maybe he'll see action here in the fourth quarter as time winds down in the third 4110 Broncos back after this message and a word from your local station Klieman our producer Bob hahnsbach our director Susan Smith Greg Gumbel Trent Green Evan Washburn and the rest of our CBS Sports crew here in Oakland as we start the fourth quarter Denver with a 4110 lead and Peyton Manning's worked for the day he hasn't done his ninth career game with five touchdown passes that as an NFL record he breaks the tie with two Brees and Brock Osweiler the thirdyear quarterback out of Arizona State throwing the slam incomplete intended for Thomas Demaryius Thomas good coverage by McGill they're undercutting the slant route we surprised a little bit that I'll swallow throw hit throw on the bottom and they come in and handing off that first snap so they're not changing their philosophy would it be great if it if it was a run that was called and just audible to the bass third and nine boss while we're standing six foot eight 240 pounds false start number 65 offense fiveyard penalty third down Billy Vasquez guilty of the early move 1 2 3 4 5 TD passes his first first one Anderson gets a little onehanded back shoulder catch and is able to convert it breaking poor tackles again damn and Sanders then Thomas and Thomas will get another one flipping the football up to his family up in the stands and then in the middle of the field start off shaky with those two intersections but definitely finish strong that's underneath that is complete to the various Thomas and that will be sure to reverse down and the punting unit come on and really if you think of those two interceptions but the only one that stands out to me is the the one a third would it work of that first interception you tried squeeze it into into coverage and the second one tuck just made an incredible play jumping up on a tipping it at the line of scrimmage that dive in and make an interception with a nine Britton Colquitt kicking to Denarius war ketchup on the form made at the 36 yard line to 1407 to play in the board 4110 we remind you coming up after the game time permitting the subway postgame show JV in company with all the latest scores and highlights all coming up on the subway postgame show Derek target and this one till the TV is Maria were not very much before von Miller makes the hit to Murray it has been a dismal day readers 12 offensive possessions seven three and outs three turnovers a touchdown in field and staring only nine reckon face the other way spinning across the 40 to 41 yard line in a hurry some numbers from around the league Ben Roethlisberger held to a single touchdown at two interceptions in the loss to the New York Jets the artery ingress 120 yards in a losing effort against San Francisco and Dez Bryant finding London very much to his liking third and six trying to step out of the way on the move looking through and great third and six that's been a recurring theme most of the day you mentioned how many times they've had three and outs and with third down not having any effectiveness running the football only 20 yards of rushing you end up in third and long quite a bit when we talked with Tony Sparano he had lots and lots of numbers to support this contention that this team is about to turn it around but none of those numbers of with coming bubbling to the top today when I got that from the from the players we talked to his good they were all very positive about this team getting better they will making progress on both sides of the ball early on they were they were definitely in the game and just they weren't able to hold it together once they started having turnovers and defensively Peyton Manning attacked early 12:43 to play the NFL on CBS is sponsored by FedEx one rate simple flat rate shipping with the reliability of FedEx Best Buy and by Lexus and their pursuit of perfection yet another example of a childhood something I can't possibly first down ah swallow giving Zach Anderson and Anderson bursting through the right side to about the 25yard line or a miner coming up after the game time permitting the subway postgame show JB and the guys in New York with all the latest NFL scores and highlights all coming up on the subway postgame show Anderson 55 total yards second year back from town ahead to it here out to about the 30 that'll be about a yard short of a first down this is more of what I expected the last time I Wyler came in the game is some handoffs and try and keep this clock running and he came out throw it he did he came out firing he's like it listen I've had one attempt off the season I'm gonna I'm gonna fire this thing so certain one Steve Anderson gets the call again here and he does reaching for the first down and the trike he might have it and it is first down as we come up on eleven minutes to play here in the fourth quarter and if you think how this game started off with with the two turnovers and with Oakland there was there was a bounce in their step and now all of a sudden you just see their body language in there they're thinking okay when is this this streak going to end when are we going to win a football game but positive things happen at the beginning of this one then all of a sudden on the near sideline and bounced out of bounds right around the 40yard line and just shy of another first down Greg you're familiar with where Cody Latimer went to school aren't you it's a football powerhouse that I went to Indiana well not if you ask Rex Ryan miss Ryan says you went to West Virginia that's right Cody Latimer did a bit a nice down there getting the ball getting up the field second and one Thompson with the first down in the ball came out but it's covered by Denver that Rex Ryan had bricks Ryan references he for some reason other he hit I said that you went to West Virginia and felt very badly about it when it hit him halfway back down the haul road yeah you know I just kind of I just kind of rolled with it when this was way back towards the beginning of the season so we've since had at the Jets a couple times now it's now it's a big joke but you do you do register as Marc Bulger on occasion the hotel yep yeah so that's my leus right first down for us while and the Broncos big deep down this sideline incomplete overthrows Andre Caldwell we have a penalty marker down holding number 75 offense and yard penalty repeat first down Chris Clark guilty of behold I remind you this week Thursday Night Football brings you a key AFC East showdown between the Miami Dolphins and the Buffalo Bills it's Thursday at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time live on NFL Network hope those teams had tough losses today but Ryan Tannehill in that Miami offense is playing much better and Kyle Orton since he's taken over for the vases huge positive thanks to them as well this is Thompson once again the carry and with 9:20 to play in the fourth let's check in to New York JB hey Greg Arizona was the best record doesn't have good news here yeah watch right here is Carson Palmer goes to step up watch his left knee it buckles right there he goes down was down for a period of time was carted off the field we haven't heard the extent of the injury but it does not look good for Arizona he said his needs 14 to 10 if we get any more information we'll pass it along Greg all right JB Thank You Carson Palmer's we sit in a brandnew deal out in Arizona sailing right along in the NFC when Carson's a difference banker and I know that Arizona's been through three different quarterbacks at point in time because of different injuries didn't gone through Carson Palmer coming back a couple weeks ago and playing very effectively and getting that that new contract this week extension for three more years and very unfortunate pistons up being a longterm injury hopefully hopefully it's not third and 17 for us while out of bounds just across the 40yard line Kevin do you hey guys just a couple injury updates whoo so DJ hey leave the game with that left groin injury he's still questionable he's trying to loosen up on the bike he's still a lot of discomfort but again just hasn't played a lot of football so any snaps he can get are important and then in the Broncos sideline Ronnie Hillman is done for today just precautionary had that left foot that he was dealing with in the first half into the third quarter his shoe is untied he's got a hat no helmet so he appears to be done all right everything it's kick in areas more back inside his 10yard line or penalty marker flies and he makes his way up the side on let's see if this comes back and it will during the return illegal block in the back number 57 of the return team half the distance to the goal first down timeout believe that's the second one today on Ray Ray Armstrong Bobby April is not a happy camper he's the special teams coach Maurice jonesdrew watching from the sidelines as the penalty sets the Raiders back to the six yard line and the bench outside swivel nowhere let's go down to Kevin Washburn Evan well guys there's a lot of De La Salle on lumps on the field today they're looking at TJ Ward and his cousin Maurice jonesdrew and they've come into sort of if there's any more celebrity with the new movie that was released recently when the game stands tall and it tells the story of if that historic program in their winning streak and after this playset update another aspect of that story that is effective TJ wars and continues to meanwhile this is McFadden and McFadden out to about the tenth before we do that Evan let's get another NFL today update a bit of good news involving the card yeah do standing this came in for Carson Palmer finds John Brown 48 yards out and right now Arizona takes to lead 1714 over st. Louis back to Greg and Trenton alright guys third and six for nothing except let me go first down and see where they do mark it looks like maybe about a yard short heaven well guys in 2004 TJ Ward lost his best friend Terrance Kelly who was a member of that De La Salle team and he continues to honor Terrence Kelly's got a tattoo of them on his shoulder TK and he's involved in the Terrance Kelly foundation that's run by his father at Lantern and they're in attendance today and he was telling us last night that some of the kids from that foundation have made their way to De La Salle playing football so he continues to honor his friend Terrence and what he meant to him back in 2004 when they start here bail us out it's pretty interesting evident talking with TJ ward I went to deala Salle High School in Chicago more than TJ worked this is Isaiah verse and I say it worse across midfield and into Oakland territories 525 to play in the fourth Villa Salle High School West Coast version the NFL on CBS is sponsored by M&amp;Ms chocolates better with them and by TD Ameritrade always a sightseeing adventure when you can know the bad news is the Raiders are looking at Oh and nine and it has been a while since a last one November 17 of last season now things have changed since then except the winning ways of the Oakland Raiders you can say what you want about the black hole and the fan base and whatever may I always enjoy coming here and playing in Oakland and that was because you want to play places where fans are passionate about their football or at least I did I enjoy coming to places that were loud I enjoyed where that were the fans really got into it and and of course Oakland fans are very passionate about their football Osweiler's hit as he released incomplete don\u00edt\u00f6 Autry the rookie free agent out of Mississippi State but yeah I can understand that dread that that's it so it's it's fun to play in front of fans like that you do you just you know when you when you come out of the locker room for warmups and you know people are already there when you come into the parking lot and people are already there and you know just throughout the course of the game yeah there may be some colorful language you hear on the sidelines but that's all part of it that just means people have a have a passion for what what they're trying to supplant and good for them third name that's incomplete in and out of the hands of CJ Anderson once again Sean Lynch is truly in beast mode yeah I'd say so his fourth touchdown of the day this 16 yard run puts out seattle of 3117 that is beast mode JV Greg it was nip and tuck back to Greg Gumbel looks like it's more tuck now JP we could say the same thing about this one nip and tuck in the first half until things got out of hand courtesy of Peyton Manning Denarius we were back in his own 10 yard line for the kick good how's that for downing a 50 club that's one it's bouncing your way right there Omar Bolden short hops it at the three yard line that's unbelievable gets blocked and that's how you doing there those of you expecting to see 60 minutes you're watching the NFL on CBS our game between the Denver Broncos and Oakland Raiders along with Trent Green and Evan Washburn I'm Greg Gumbel 41:10 Broncos in the lead 60 minutes will be seen in its entirety immediately after this game except on the west coast where it will be seen at its regularly scheduled time I'm serious you can break a finger too short hopping a football okay you could that was that was very similar to a third baseman sometimes waving their glug add blood of all not seen it in we have a pool of it that's a difference take a peek ahead for the Denver Broncos not exactly a chip shot from now until the end of the season they've got Oakland again Cincinnati you don't know how they're going to show up they have been so up and down came the city played him well in Denver earlier this year on second and nine pause it down several times and then hit the drums blue over the middle and you'll have about another three yards for a first down let's see where they spot it third and two we are under three and a half minutes to play big day for Julius Thomas the fine tighten department bargain loft it down the far sideline leaping and making the catch is Denarius more and now taken away let's see the officials confer on the far side of the field where are they gonna rule they're gonna say do a possession Raiders ball is gonna be my call you got it they go up for the variance is able to come down with it and as it's secured they both have it now once he's already down didn't they wrestle the ball away from him Roby wrestles the ball away from him but when contact was made with the ground that's dual possession it's got to go to the offensive player so John Fox will challenge and standing by in New York gosh we haven't seen him all day but because there hasn't been much controversy here our officiating expert Mike Kerry Mike you saw the play with you things yeah this is an interesting way it's not a simultaneous test because the offense has clear control in the air but in the process of going to the ground it gets wrestled away by the defense so the question is did you have control while he was upright long enough to maintain a catch or is he going to the ground in the process and that'll be really interesting to see what they come up with yeah you don't see this very often do you you know not very much at all and my opinion is that they're really going to feel this point to stand because there's not enough evidence to decide what Square or the other this happened alright Mike thank you very much gosh that would put that would put Trent green and Mike Carey on the same side of the fence on this one he use different terminology it wasn't dual possession at the beginning but really on the field stands first down Oakland and they're both will be the first time out there our guys are always right except when they're not so there is Denarius more whip to grab at least that that's all we want to talk about is the pasture nice play by Bradley Roby chested he didn't rest the ball away in time car over the middle that's complete Michael Rivera and Rivera about the 35 for another first down as we come up on two and a half to play so now the best records in the AFC New England and then where we share that seven and to mark Cleveland Kansas City Indianapolis right behind him at six and three we saw that New England in Everett I cool New England has the advantage because of the tiebreaker than plane last week headtohead with the winner full stop at the 30yard line and we'll take our break with two minutes to play here in Oakland long day for number four a reminder tonight on CBS begins with 60 minutes and a reporting trip to the Ebola hot zone that's followed by new episodes of Madam Secretary The Good Wife and see Assad Oh CBS team minutes to play here in Oakland and a much happier Peyton Manning onside and the clock continues to move you can see there the aggressiveness of Denver's defense least 11 a number of their players that the line at or near the line of scrimmage not looking to give up any more points the Raiders million points have gotten are off those turnovers in the first half eight defendants nine defenders on the thin line his famous boxer car long edge the rush completes the pass inside the 22 about the 17 or 18 yard line is Vincent Brown John Elway ready to be a part of the happy Broncos who were pleased to be back in the win column they took that loss of New England hard they did the hopeful the whole organization did really and you know John Fox was talking to us about that last night this these votes they had it there's a touchdown pass over the middle of Michael Rivera there's something positive for Oakland to take with them in the next week Derek are standing in there leading up a nice drive down the field and he's getting Rivera down the middle of the field safeties roll into a cover suits those 101 down the middle with TJ warden puts that high on the back shoulder to where only Rivera can make that catch second touchdown pass of the day for Derek Carr the ball is not marked ready for play the tribe will be attempted again so janakowski will do that all over meanwhile Derek Carr now up to 13 touchdown passes in this his rookie season so 48 seconds on the clock in Denver's lead now 41:17 derrick karr on the money to Michael Rivera you know there are some people who might think that that's pretty meaningless but you said just a moment ago that's something for them to take with them and I wonder how how seriously do players consider that well I think you have to and this is such a young team and they're growing and progressing every week they we talked to the players we talked to the coaches about the respect that Derek Carr has in the locker room the spread to the respect that he carries in the meeting room on the practice field and on game day just how much everybody values him and understands it he's the quarterback here he's the future of this organization mr. reminder 60 minutes coming up next except for those of you on the west coast who will be seeing it at its regularly scheduled time so two touchdown passes today for Derek Carr five for his opposite number at the sideline HankMed the constant little onside kick attempt recovered by the Broncos Andre Caldwell how is Payton Station once started out here Anderson does a nice onehanded grab he's able to break through four different tackles and that kind of got his day going and a couple interceptions early did Peyton Manning but then pouring it on with five touchdown passes to Emmanuel Sanders to Julius Thomas and just overall got dive in 31 a 44 340 yards five touchdowns I'd say after those two picks he definitely definitely got things going the way he's used to but you know he will crack about this he will die don't that'll eat him up and that's why he's so great one more snap the Broncos will move to seven and two and the Oakland Raiders will fall 209 one I think if you talked to Peyton Manning he's gonna be focused in on getting ready for the st. Louis Rams at st. Louis they played very well at home they have a good defense they can pressure the quarterback and it will be a road game and they have said they don't play they haven't played particularly well on the road they're only two and two now and that was one of the things he talked about coming into this game they were they were one and two on the road he wanted they wanted to learn they said we need to get road wins we need to get better that and John Fox is like well I tend to think it's about who you play on the road having lost two at Seattle and at New England had more to do with it than what the more Peyton was talking about there's your final score the Denver Broncos 41 the Oakland Raiders 17 a reminder once again tonight on CBS it's 60 minutes followed by Madam Secretary The Good Wife and CSI Raiders 7 and 2 they wish 0 and 9 on the air Denver the winner for Trent and heaven and all of us Greg Gumbel so long from Oakland you can watch",

  "transcript": "here on the west coast the Raiders have won the toss and they will defer which means that the Denver Broncos and Peyton Manning will get their hands on the ball first down plots at one time defensive coordinator for the Raiders in his fourth year as the Broncos head coach and Tony Sparano in his fifth game as Oakland's interim head coach he even plays Dennis Allen after the Raiders and for start you know we talked to Tony Sparano yesterday and he gave every indication in the world that he would not defer but that's exactly what he did when he talked about Denver getting getting started Baxton and getting the ball quickly in Vietnam burr won in scoring getting the ball quickly ball will start at the 20 yard line let's check in downstairs with Evan Washburn Avenue well Greg after the Broncos 22 point loss to the Patriots last week GM John Elway did something he rarely does he addressed the team his message according to DeMarcus Ware was it's time to hit the reset button you've been served humble pie how will you respond and as for Oakland they're taking us against the world mentality in this game Tony Sparano knows no one believes we can win this game but we do great all right Evan thank you from the 20yard line and Manning the throne right off the bat over the middle wide open across the 25 and close to the first down right at the first down marker is Julius Thomas Peyton Manning he of the five MVP awards and NFL records 515 career touchdown passes he didn't take last week's loss to the Patriots well at all you can understand why he doesn't lose very many football games this is approach all week and the way that he dealt with his teammates is is why he's the leader he is one pass in first down play fake matting pray over the middle tipped internship that picked off by DJ Hayden Hayden and the Raiders get a turnover right off the bat and sometimes as a quarterback whether it's a veteran or it's a young guy you can try do it two months Manning tries thrown into terpil coverage over the top of the linebacker and underneath the safety and Sanders is just not able to get up to it when you come in that focus and that determines sometimes you can press a little bit even for a veteran like Peyton Manning that has all the records that he has you can be so focused and determined that sometimes you're trying too much too quickly instead of letting the letting the game just happen Denver with just six giveaways over the first eight games they give one away right here right off the bat picked it up Darren maquette working Darren bar the Raider quarterback his numbers from a sixpoint loss at Seattle last week working very hard to be a leader on this team well he continues to try and improve and get better he talked to us for the first time this season he put together a separate tape and he sat down with his specialists to go through it talk about things that he expects from them and things that he needs to do better as well pick a couple three on first down it's now second and seven what the outside is complete and mrs. James the first down close to the 35 the veteran on the offensive line is 10year man Phillipe Barnes illusion right tackle the left guard for injured game Jackson and I am Michael Rivera become a target favorite eight catches two of them four touchdowns against the Seahawks last week from the Broncos 36 and for a couple on that decker front war DeMarcus Ware 125 career sacks eight of them in this first season as a Bronco the outstanding pass rushing linebacker Von Miller with a team leading nine sacks on the year and safety TJ Ward when of several brought in this season to strengthen and solidified at Denver defense second and six Marcel Reece the full bamboo out of the backfield and out of bounds at about the 31 yard line pushed out by TJ Ward well that's one way to slow down the pass rushes is get the ball out of your hands quickly and so far the Raiders have been an effective with the running game and here with Vaughn Miller getting up the field trying to jump and get a tip McFadden doing a nice job of getting down around his knees to make sure that he can't jump up and knock that ball down 35 barking catch made at the 25yard line that'll be good for a first down rice Butler the second year wide receiver from San Diego State you can see the poise the car has standing in the pocket the attic or see as he gets that ball up the field getting the ball into Butler even though there was good coverage by Brandon Marshall putting it in the location where only the receiver can catch the ball so another first down for the Raiders Patton the deep man on the back feet and Kimbrough Tompkins and Tompkins brought down at about the 27 yard line by DeMarcus Ware DeMarcus Ware does a nice job of staying at home he's here at the bottom of your screen 94 he comes up field and he's able to just stay home stay honest with the play and not give up the big gain around the edge this Denver defense has allowed just three points to opponents on the opening drives of games this season second and 12 on the loss of Jeep catches made at the 22 yard line by Brian lien Hartman tight end once again car does a nice out put the ball low and away away from only where his receiver can catch the ball being a little conservative throw instead of keeping it up high where he can turn up the field and get it but he's doing a nice job of protecting the football not make it a risky throw so car in the Raiders now looking at a third and seven they need the 15yard line for a first down three but not nearly enough for a horse down James Jones makes the catch and Brandon Marshall makes the tackle and that'll bring on Sebastian Janikowski in the field goal unit well because of that heavyduty Denver pass rush you get the feeling there's a lot of dinking and dunking going on on the Raiders offense right now well this they're they're trying to get the ball up the field here comes Von Miller that spin move getting pressure on car ride away he has to get to the crossing route underneath instead of hanging on to push it down with you Janikowski from 41 yards out is perfect and the turnover turns into three points for the Raiders three nothing Oakland's up nine and a half to play here in the first DJ Hayden makes the interception the scoring drive is 26 yards in nine plays Sebastian Janikowski with the 41 yard field goal and the Raiders will have three nothing lead on Denver Caldwell is beat for the Broncos and when this went out of the end zone and well the progress will be market about the 25yard line so Peyton Manning with his second shot at the offense when we come back the NFL on CBS is sponsored by Southwest Airlines book your low fare now at southwest.com Microsoft Surface the official tablet of the NFL and by bub light to remind fans to stay in the game and trick responsibly eastbound on the Bay Bridge beautiful day here in northern Cal 25 yard line Manning Pillman reversing field as winning and back down as he crosses the 32 up the 31 yard line Larry is Sante with the tackle look at that Denver offensive line and an awful lot of shuffling going on will Montgomery an ending up at Center today Demaryius Thomas having a great year averaging a hundred eleven point eight yards a game that is the best average in the NFL let's compete to the 40yard line Emmanuel Sanders oaklands 43 defense has a look e on the D line and fourth round draft pick Justin Ellis out of Louisiana Tech one of the very best defensive football players in the league the rookie linebacker Camille back and in the secondary veteran quarterback Carl's Rodgers house secondyear corner DJ Hayden has already made his mark today with an interception this is CJ Anderson Anderson pushed down yardage and more in Oakland territory to about the 41 yard line they caught the Raiders on the Blitz coming up the middle getting presser see on crosstalk there with the middle linebackers and CJ Anderson getting the second level with the linebackers on the Blitz and did were able to pick it up it just creates a big hole in the middle of the field Anderson's filling the backfield with who set of downs for Manning at the Oakland 41 Sam severed what 2:36 by charles woodson well as touchdown passes go in consecutive games drew brees leading the way with 54 then Tom Brady right behind him with 52 Peyton Manning and John Unitas both at 47 second and five compared to this side welcome at the 38 Brandon Ross with a second straight terrific play when Brandon Moss lined up over the slot with DJ hate to the outside two receivers a shot running that quick throw to Wes Welker it just Manny looks to the far side of the field wide open has his man and a penalty flag flies from deep in the secondary Demaryius Thomas he began to check the flag our referee today is holding number 29 defense tough penalties define the vocal play first down so Ross with the holding penalty Damaris is gonna go sit up here in the hole the official that calls the plays way back here Peyton just recognizes from a coverage scamp standpoint with Woodson trying to get back into cover to Damaris is left alone on that sideline and Peyton's able to drop it right in that cover to hole along with along the boundary that flag felt like it came from the upper deck first down at the 17 this is CJ Anderson and amber shame about the 10 miles Burris and Woodson combining with attacker while talking with Peyton talking with Julius Thomas both last night a lot of their pre alignment and motion stuff that's just to get recognition of what coverage the Raiders are in and how they're going to match it up and then Peyton can determine where he wants to go with that matchup second into this received a emphasis the first down it'll be first enroll inside the Oakland fire with monta ball being out of the game or being out of this game CJ Anderson getting a lot of looks not only from running the ball but also on the receiving end of some throws want a ball suffering at Boyd and Dre back on the fifth in back next week for some gold growing incomplete and under three Ronnie Hillman out of the backfield he had Khalil Mack right in front of him and max stopped the Raiders are going to be bring pressure from all of their linebackers coming from the middle up coming from the middle of the field so you're gonna see nobody covers him out in the flat Payton just doesn't get enough on it second and goal the tip on the right side of the y part number 66 offense Romero's usually the center playing right guard today because of the injuries so right here right guard that's where the movement comes so that backs the Broncos up to the nine second and goal rabbi Julius Thomas and he's out of bounds right at about the nine yard line so third and goal with nine yards to go Trent one it looks like there's an injured Raider down on the field as they call timeout but I think you have to obviously push it into the end zone in this area of the field the NFL leader in touchdown receptions Julius Thomas has to be your main target CJ Wilson is the injured Raider the fifthyear defensive end we'll take a break 503 to play in the first third and goal for the Denver Broncos from the 9 yard line spreads the peel you got Demaryius Thomas one on walk right here with DJ Hey with pets on the slant Raiders did a good job of disguising it to get Payton out of that play Charles Woodson was up near the box that's what calls that underneath the route he drops out into coverage they fall back into zone so as they get that completion good rally by the defense of the Raiders make sure Demaryius Thomas doesn't get into the end zone Brandon McManus six out of nine and field goal this one to the time and it's good 4:06 to play in the first quarter and the broncos come back for the 33 tie here and open the NFL on CBS is sponsored by Verizon X LTE on America's largest most reliable 4G LTE network game by the new comedy Horrible Bosses 2 in theaters November 26 4:06 to play in the first corner Raider defense stands tall the redzone rolling we're tied and 373 yard drive ending with the 20 yard McManus you looked Amyas Murray is beat for the kick foreigner not good chance to return miss them total come out to the 20yard line let's go back to a past that fell short by Peyton Manning as a first down the Raiders only have 10 on the field and CJ Anderson you're gonna see he's right here he's coming out of the backfield into the flat actually it's Hillman coming out into the flat they blitz they're four linebackers that are in the game and no one is left out there Peyton instead of floating the ball out to him right here there's no one on him he's got the pass rush instead of just floating it out there making an easy catch he gets fooled a little bit because he thinks that Khalil Mac is gonna continue with the Russian he just lays it up too short whatever is the opportunity on the touchdown we're done Derek Carr across the 25 McFadden out of the backfield a pickup of 610 Utley second in for the CBS Sports app now has the fastest scores downloaded today and be the first to get your football updates and s'mores right on your phone and by the way knowing Peyton would beat himself up over that one team he will miss the opportunity von Miller makes the stop yeah that big huddle over on the sidelines is right around Peyton Manning it's the bulk of his office I don't think there's any stress on their part I think it's more just Peyton getting the communication part of it down getting everybody on the same page directly ball gained in the first quarter there's no need to go major panic mode that he just wants everybody valid in the focus little baby Derek are now on 32 sit down enemy and sideline pass is incomplete pass is intended for fencing Wow go back to what you mentioned earlier at the very top of our broadcast Derek Carr is dedicated to making not only his teammates around him better but himself as well well that was one of the things he did this week has put together that videotape where he wanted about 15 to 20 plays showing some things from a communication standpoint that he wants to be on the same page with his skilled players who brought in wide receivers running backs Knight is talking about how they can improve what his expectations are that just shows you back how that's developing I say it hurts you caught a ton of touchdown passes from David mistake for years returns this pic excuse me Derrick Carmen back to about the 35 yard line 226 to play in the first this month is Military Appreciation

knife stab of finding signs and sitting in those windows and beam that check down for Peyton Manning as he's trying to push the ball up the field he knows he can look towards welcome to find that underneath below and is complete and into Oakland territory as Demaryius Thomas well last year Tony Sparano could not unfortunately he couldn't shake the backpack Peyton Manning had a heck of a season against the Oakland Raiders last year eight incompletions and seven touchdowns that's that's all her one first down quick pass to the outside Thomas Demaryius Thomas and that about the 41 we touched earlier about derrick karr getting the ball out of his hands quickly so that pressure doesn't get to him same things happening with peyton manning for the most part the ball is getting out of his hands quickly not allowing pass rush from the raiders to affect them and second into that pass outside and complete of diving Andre Caldwell could regionally burden to well that's going to be something to keep an eye on there I'm sure made a nice all the way the Terrell brown number twenty three jump that routing is very aggressive in the covers the hill was only second and two but when you're playing the sticks like that as a defensive back pate man he's going to keep that in his mind about maybe getting a double move a little bit later as this game on hold double brother Manny and that catch is made by Julius Thomas and he was well covered by Charles Woodson we talked to Peyton last night about how are they going to match up with Julius Thomas suddenly left side of your screen number 80 Charles Woodson is sitting down there in coverage he's matched up oneonone there's different ways you use Woodson even though he's in his 17th year as the defensive back he could play in the slide he could play oneonone with you best receiver cover tie dances all in man down the sideline deep penalty marker flies there's that shot up the field it didn't take him long to go in six row gross Terrell brown covering Demaryius Thomas pass interference number 23 defense automatic first down Tovah round just a couple of plays ago was very aggressive here they are matched up on the top of your screen here he was aggressive you seemed squat and her getting his feet squared riding around the sticks riding around that first down marker and that's what payton saw and second down that's let me decide to take a shot up the sideline so first count from the 15yard line and he's right again false start number 74 offense fiveyard penalty first rounds of time it comes from the left side of the line left guard Orlando Franklin Warnock the usual right tackle is out with a shoulder injury that causes Vasquez and Manny Ramirez to move and Montgomery in at center well it's very unusual for Denver to have a prop because they do so much quick count Falls talent extra count part counts Payton changes it up and Chloe outside dot and a cordon complete discovered Co more in the coverage number 55 for the Raiders the linebacker core is a good young core of liner to steal more in a second year miles burst through the middle linebacker and his third year include Mac we've talked about several times to rookie some good young speed linebackers that play with a lot of force second and 15 can you give it to her killer about the 16 yard line and Manning is gonna let the clock wind down here at the end of 30 so they will change ends of the field Oakland Raiders holding their own for the first 15 minutes of this game 3 3 into 1 this is the NFL on CBS that gorgeous aerial view is all of our aerial coverage of today's game provided by MetLife he's favoring the Broncos that one turnover turned into three on the ward for the Raiders third and ten as we start the second quarter with pass on the slack complete to the Americans Thomas Thomas brought down at about the ten and Charles Woodson from the same draft class as Peyton Manning when the Raiders showed the same coverage as they did on the last third down inside the red zone where they dropped guys into a cover to show with guys underneath Broncos went back to the same way getting Demaryius Thomas on a slant to the outside trying to get him to break some tackles and get the first down and once again the Raiders defense helped Furman whole team it's good to redzone trips for the Broncos to field goals 63 Denver any yet this Thursday on CBS Phil Simms guest stars on a new Elementary don't miss his sure to be nominated performance news due 10/9 central only CBS the man will be sure to the 20yard line let's go green with Trenton well coming into this game the Raiders offensive leave only allowed nine sacks type for first in the league in sacks allowed by they're going up against von Miller with the spin move here against San Francisco getting the sack on comprehend Kaepernick in 2.27 second on the other side you have DeMarcus Ware coming over from Dallas with the fake spin get Staley looking looking nowhere he's just looking into space and just the pressure that these two outside wrestlers bring it'll be tough on date Derek Karl that's just not fair DeMarcus Ware that'll be a loss of about three to four on the play we just got through talking about DeMarcus wearing the presents he has in the past Russ here playing off the block being able to make the tackle in the backfield no were for McFadden to go to Marcus last night after all the success he enjoyed in Dallas talking about this kind of a rebirth for him in Denver Louisa said it's it's fresh players fresh attitude and you know you sometimes get a little complacent and during the same routine he was talking about Dallas but now coming to here a fresh start for him trying to prove himself second and 13 intended receiver McFadden slipped and fell to the turf well going back to DeMarcus Ware it's interesting to hear him use the terms you know trying to prove himself after all that he's accomplished in this league he's in his ninth season and he the number of sacks that he's had in the career that he had in Dallas but he feels like he does have to prove himself he's excited about this opportunity in Denver 125 career sacks Maurice jonesdrew onto the field for first time today on third and 13 that's Michael Rivera the tight end is brought down just across the 20 in about the 23 yard line and that'll force the punt meanwhile San Francisco 49ers on the road at New Orleans in overtime by a field goal 27:24 a tough place to play and New Orleans was able to be back in the game they were they were behind most of that game and he able to come back tied up send its overtime but San Francisco held on for the movie down there for the fair catch aim it at the 32 yard line Denver taking over with a one field goal lead the NFL on CBS is sponsored by call of duty advanced warfare available now rated mature Macy's and by Coors Light with this week's most refreshing fan Douglas s during englishstyle my school year tales of teaching when a inch hands tall man throwing tipped in the air Justin Tuck the football what a play by Justin Tuck and just like that the Raiders are set up at the Denver 12 Dustin tuck reading this all the way he's lined up here he's going to get upfield and then jump able to tip this falling keep the concentration Julius Thomas sneaking out him to the right flat Manning trying to get it to him and tuck showing tremendous athleticism getting the tip and also able to cradle that ball and get the interception what a great play what a great play paetynn attempting to get in on the tackle slowing him down so the rest of his offensive teammates can can stop him stop tuck before before scoring the touchdown Peyton Manning two interceptions at New England last week two today so far and it's early yet so car and the Raiders at the Denver 12 the shuttle pass mcfadden to the five run down by von miller he spread everyone out you get the defense thinking you're gonna push the ball up the field did you get a semi roll or half roll to the right by car with McFadden coming underneath get those pass rushers up the field flipping underneath on the shuttle pass able to pick up six yards on the on the completion ball is marked at the six yard line Raiders can get a first down without scoring a touchdown skooby just inside the five and von miller again in on the defensive stuff third and two two yards for a first down five yards for a touchdown we just had that graphic up there about the Raiders in red zone touchdown percentages and second in the National Football League behind the Broncos they actually may be ahead the Broncos now since the Broncos have had to settle for too few days here they're in their possessions rolling endzone touchdown twice Butler penalty marker is down roughing the passer is the call I believe on DeMarcus Ware that penalty will be declined and the Raiders have the touchdown long since it's a story play there it is going to be reviewed upstairs there was a lot of discussions by the officials 94 we're on the left side of your screen he's the one that's going to get called for the penalty but as the discussion was going on about the penalty the admissions in the back of the end zone were discussing whether or not he had both feet down that half ball security you can see the Janikowski is lining up for the extra point so it must been cleared up is good the Oakland Raiders with all ten of their points off turnovers Manning interceptions ten six Oakland alley would be first counts Friday on CBS don't miss the first ever broadcast at the Hollywood Film Awards live all of your favorites will be there Queen Latifah hosts Friday at 8:00 7:00 central only CBS Andre Caldwell Omar Bolden deep for the Denver Broncos that miss Sayla to the end zone he'll come out to the 20yard line trick rice Butler who catches the touchdown will be working in the back here but it's the two defenders that the Dare car is getting watching right here this defender this defender coming up to get the coverage as soon as car sees the two defenders squeeze that underneath throughout he knows he's going with the ball to the back of the end zone here here you can see Butler get both feet down that's what the discussion after the play and then we're with that left arm up around cars neck and Justin Tuck with the football players equivalent of hallelujah first down left side for a gain of a puff two or three put down by Jerome Brown see what Broncos have done with their possession is this Oakland defense have three interceptions in the first eight games of this season they picked off to of Peyton Manning's passes today second seven almost intercepted their CEO more had a chance we talked we talked at the beginning of the game about Peyton Manning and his focus coming into the meeting last night we talked to John Fox and Julius Thomas about Peyton's approach during the week of practice and what he was trying to get accomplished and sometimes you can press too much and so far in this game he's been trying to press too much pushing the ball at the field crossing pattern is complete at the 30yard line Arius Thomas and has enough for the first down for quarterback Sprint's that crossing pattern must be like a security blanket well when you have a guy like to marry as Thomas come in he's coming over from that the outside are actually Damaris is inside here yet those crossing routes gets a ball out of your hands quickly and with a guy that big see he was actually contact was named short of the first down but he was able to reach and get across the 30 type in let's go down the immigrants well guys just a quick update somebody to keep an eye on Ronnie Hillman at the end of the first quarter came to the sidelines with some discomfort in his left foot now they put some heavy tape over the cleat he's been back in this game but I've been watching him closely he's been walking gingerly he's been sprinting on the sidelines during off series just something to keep an eye on Ronnie Hillman with the left foot all right I've been thinking that Leif CJ Anderson was the primary ball carrier inactive today and that's Anderson straight ahead to about the 38 third and one maybe 30 G's at the 38yard line as we'll want to paint Mandy trying to change up the temple and get the ball snapped quickly that's well complete for a first down outofbounds at the 46 Manning's continuing to try and push the tempo not let the Raiders change personnel get it moving in it in and out didn't intercept a sense that's a that clearly is there's one comes across manbat it down over the middle see if that was number 90 pat sims you got a big haul up there to knock it down sentences right here you're going to see what they tell defenders a lot of times as if you're not able to get push initially you're getting doubleteamed Sims is getting doubleteamed stop and watch the quarterback and elevate it try to knock down those cross do elevator you think you did you think you got off the ground they got a credit card but he got some elevation complete and mrs. CJ Anderson shipping a tackler and gets the first down out of bounds at about the Oakland 43 and now we have DJ Hayden in wants 22 Anderson coming out of the backfield and the Raiders have dropped everybody and covered that that's been there at their battle so far in this game as drop people and coverage rally and force Peyton to throw into tight windows that's how they've gotten the interceptions you're not getting the same type of quarterback pressure you would normally get when you're rushing more guys but by dropping the defenders that's work to their favor right now we have two injured Raiders on that play DJ Hayden 25 Brandon Ross 29 Carlos Rogers in active today TJ Carey inactive today so now number 31 Nikko Thorpe is long to the field and so is number 39 Keith McGill and this isn't the teammate that came in at you said Greg they came in thinning in the secondary now listen you lose two on one play looks like they're going to go to a cover to disco into coverage back on the field Rose Gilman and Gilman spun down close to the 40 yard line by Co war well you looked at some of the numbers back to this play we push our own on second and nine time and that when back down as he was taken down Justin Ellis the whoopee defensive tackle might have gotten a hand on that talk about the presser being able to get pressure on paint man this time they are able to get presser but if you're going to be doubleteam you need to get your hands up and I'm not gonna use to harm elevate again but remember we got his arm up able to knock down those crossing routes those paintings up on his back third and nine Manning stepping up open sideline pass incomplete intended for Emmanuel Sanders and well contested by DJ Hayden Hayden back out on the field after missing a snap getting dinged up a little bit but sitting all over that comeback route he gets that left arm extended in between Sanders two hands and was able to get a piece of the balls Britton Colquitt try and pin the Raiders deep in their own territory enough's enough hi there and maybe at about the 10yard line 806 to play in the first half the Raider 106 the NFL on CBS is sponsored by USAA USAA proudly salutes all those who have served and find the tunnels official sponsor of the NFL I love an edge in we remind you coming up the Verizon halftime report JP &amp; Company all the latest scores and highlights in a preview of Thursday Night Football on NFL Network coming up on the Verizon halftime report Maurice jonesdrew in the backfield behind Derrick thought well these Raiders have lost 14 consecutive games and not one since November 17th of last year at Houston and you see the the changes that have been made and not least of which have been in the coaching staff well and I like the the gas is going down that's a good one I like that that's it that's that's it that's a real positive six Humvees that you drive in second and six I'm incomplete at the 20yard line intended for Jones for the first time today that looks like a car through into traffic he tried squeezing it in there and he's done a good job of keeping the ball away from defenders not pressing the ball beat doing a good job of managing the game you don't want to completely not be aggressive but when you're down inside your own 20 you had success after two turnovers by Denver don't give them an opportunity to get things rolling now on third and sixth a 20yard line first down great nearly enough for a first down Jones with the catch in the loose football no he's ruled out of bounds he's actually ruled down at the 16 yard line that's where forward count progress was marked so the whistle blew before that ball came out I don't know if that's necessarily the route there were two receivers within five yards of each other both doing out routes on the far side of the field either somebody was short with the router or deep with the route but you can't have two guys stack that close together fifteen fair catches or in made by Isaiah verse 6:45 to play in the first quarter here comes Payton section the Saturday the FCC on CBS brings you the best games for the best conference dak Prescott in the top ranked Mississippi State Bulldogs with their toughest test yet the trip to Tuscaloosa to the fake 5th ranked rings inside of Alabama it all begins in college football today live at 3:00 Eastern here on CBS when our talking about that absolutely giveaway by LSU last night then you gotta be sitting there got to be sick today you can see the reaction of the fans after that game last night Richard Gere Sanders is down at the 45 yard line Terrell brown with the stop and enemy just about a twoyard gain it'll be second and eight well that seems to be what the Raiders want to do today is play soft in their coverage and rally and be secure with their takis and so far today they looking forward to and officials are gonna get together and talk about it let's see being in tents on the ground mean there was no receipts exactly what it is fentanyl grounding number 18 offense wash it down third down we're going to show you real quick that there is no one in the air we're Payton throwing receivers running to clear out here you got Welker coming across the field but there's not going to be anybody in this area the field will Peyton Manning throws the football away he's under pressure he realizes that trying to get it in the correction of Welker but nowhere near him he fishes had no choice but to throw that bro 18 sets up the screen threw it behind CJ Anderson only eight incompletions against the Raiders in tui games and 11 today alone well what the Raiders have been able to do is get him in third and long even the two times that Denver had to settle for few holes they were third and long you know good job of putting pressure on early down he's not me to get his brushing and rallied and making tackles overheat in areas Morgan lift this one bouncing it takes a Broncos inside the flag and into the endzone for the touchdown poor decision by Denarius more to let that ball hit the ground a good decision to go up and make a block prevent them from downing it inside the 10 so this is the kind of day intent for Peyton Manning well you're not even to get pressure on Peyton Manning you need to sit back and be able to jump up and knock some of those underneath crossing routes and they have been able to make some contact on paper for the most part there hasn't been constant pressure and so if you're able to drop coverage and keep the deep pass away you know those underneath throws are going to be lower elevation and so far the Raiders have done a nice job tipping the passes and knocking them down no one is happy after a loss and certainly Peyton wasn't happy to the loss at New England but what you use that there make quarterbacks have those kinds of numbers and then take it Maurice jonesdrew with the carry when you go back to last week's came in over 400 yards passing he had two touchdowns he did have the two interceptions but he just took that game very hard you can understand why there's a lot that goes on between his rivalry with Tom Brady his rivalry with the New England Patriots but you've got to refocus be dialed in because the Raiders have a good game plan and heat approach that they're taking in today on second seven this is Rory's change it is about the 29yard line nice dude 5:22 play as you look at the best marks in the AFC Denver trying to climb up there with New England at seven and to Cleveland Kansas City in Indy and if you talk to all those teams and all those coaches all those quarterbacks and signets it's real early to start talking playoffs but it's not real early when you start talking about advantage for homefield advantage for five weeks those kinds of things across the 30 to the 32 yard line Michael Rivera for only the fourth first down of this game for the Oakland Raiders so Rivera right here he's going to come in motion as the boss snap he's going to come back underneath and out into the flat cut Marcel Reece 45 is actually leading it to draw the coverage away from him and Rivera is stacking him behind that draws the defense out on Reece and you're able to hit her car is able to hit Rivera for the first down 420 to play in the first half with time going deep far sideline as incomplete fans are looking for a flag there is not intended for Vincent ground covered closely by Chris Harris Chris Harris is matched up the stutter moved to the outset outside a lot of contact up the field as Harris is turning his head around to try and locate the football he gets that left arm into Vincent Browns chest and which usually draws usually he's the way they've been calling it this year I'm surprised that wasn't thrown and the Raiders have a valid argument and discussing why that flag wasn't drunk it's where that's complete you know the Oakland Raiders have not let aim at halftime all season long there's offensive coordinator Greg Olson those are tough numbers to have to deal with on a regular basis when we talked to Derek Carr about that with the changes Dennis Allen has head coach it really wasn't much of a change for Derek because there said they didn't change offensive corner that it changed philosophy got renovated in his interceptive net field Bradley Roby the firstround draft pick out of Ohio State Derek Carr under pressure he initially pulls the ball back because of that contact and once he reloads too much faith in Rivera getting across throwing that into double coverage you have a trail technique underneath by robing he's able to undercut that throw good safety help over the top court decision by Derek Carr that's I'm just trying to force it so mainly with the football three and a half remaining each team degree of its title tomato to the 49yard line sitting watching Peyton as he's trying to change the tempo of again he's done this a couple times during the game sometimes they get up the line of scrimmage and he wants to go through this big play call and play change eating up the play clock and other times he snapped it quickly that sink roads and yeah batted down at the line Khalil Mack number 52 the Raiders philosophy today has been if you can't get fresher changeup restaurant pant many quickly get your hands up get your hands up because that's where they underneath the crushing route to sit down rounds the ball is going to come out with a lower trajectory and we just had a few clips of it a minute ago and now we can add another one see that graphic 5 batted balls today stepping up rolling the CJ Anderson and Anderson up the sidelines but sit back 5:20 he's gonna go touchdown Broncos Gregory had just gotten through talking about how good of a job the Raiders have done with their tackling today especially in third and long they've dropped coverage he's been able to rally come up and make the tackles with the Raiders want to know is if he stepped out of bounds after breaking away from three tackles right on the Raiders sideline you can tell from that replay that he didn't step out of bounds I would imagine that the entire sideline we've been going crazy had he stepped out of bounds so CJ Anderson's first touchdown of this season Peyton Manning with his 25th touchdown pass of the year Bradley Roby's interception led to the touchdown past 51 yards and the Raiders trailed by 3 a reminder the Verizon halftime report coming your way two minutes 44 seconds of the exact AP and company will have sports highlights and a preview of Thursday night football NFL Network coming up on the horizon halftime report peyton manning's 48 consecutive game with a touchdown pass that breaks the third place tied with Johnny Unitas miss Marie will not get a chance to return this saw the touchback will bringing bring the ball out to the 20yard line and Thursday Night Football this week reshoot the key AFC East showdown Miami Dolphins and the football bills Thursday at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time live on NFL Network these teams on the short end of the score today Buffalo losing a heartbreaker to Kansas City Miami a heartbreaker at Detroit well both those teams are battling for playoff spots it's awfully early to discuss discussing it but they're in position to where they can find you one of those wildcard spot that's complete about the 24yard line James Jones Greg you didn't realize the power that you had right you knew the last time the Raiders had to have the ball in you talked about them going up and having a lead at halftime so they've got to go down here and get some get some points up on the board yeah that's my goodness you had that that power serve up here in the gate did you 25 that'll bring us to the twominute warning brandon marshall with the tackle two minutes to play here in the first half 10 for 13 10 is the NFL on CBS beautiful look at Lake Merritt downtown Oakland California third and five big play for car and the Raiders they want to extend the drive keep the ball away from Peyton Manning look for at least a longrange goal attempt from Jeff Cosby throw it deep down the sideline it is incomplete off the fingertips of the intended receiver Bryce Butler a key to leave covers so Peyton Manning will get the ball back in all three of his timeouts remaining and some time on the clock Bryce Butler was actually on the inside of the three receivers and he's running a wheel route with the two outside receivers doing sit down he's trying to catch them once once they recognize man coverage Isiah first deep to kick up coming from marquette King high snap hangs it up at the sideline getting someone cuts it back penalty marker flies he is down that about the 40yard line of the Oakland Raiders Jamar Chaney making the stop here's Carl Jeffers on the fly during the return illegal block in the back number 30 10yard penalty first down David Bruton jr. he's coming in here and he's actually gonna get the block in the back here who I think he's going after is right there he missed him he either missed him or because of the slow upper knee he just with his angle just wasn't in good position and ultimately ended up giving the possitive huge yard in to his agent which takes two first down chromatic this is Anderson Anderson breaking free leaping over a tackler and down at the 45 yard line jumped over Larry Asante CJ Anderson the second year running back from California putting on a good show today if you utilize the kabocha late the front end the pass we talked about the river injuries right up the middle inside the 35 to the 33 and Asante making the tackle and we come up to one minute remaining threetwoone Thompson rookie out of Duke coming in at running back making some offthefield Denver is sitting in with three timeouts oh you're wondering why they don't have that sense of urgency at 45 give it a Thompson wrestling to the ground by miles Burris the middle linebacker and we get timeout stops the clock with 35 seconds to play in the first half with NFL now remember the heartpounding wins or the gutwrenching losses of your favorite team for a limited time watch a free trial of NFL film team yearbook on your connected TV device or go to nfl.com slash now to learn more Brandon McManus target lies at 26 yard line trying to remember the last time I did see Peyton Manning and put a sense of urgency so keenly call well he had more sense of urgency on the previous two series where he was trying to get some tempo going trying to hit the defense on their heels and this time with all the time Hudson it's almost like he's trying to prevent the Raiders from getting the ball back I anticipate now that they ran the ball three times and he's the far side of the field touchdown Emmanuel Sanders Manning put that pass right on the button on the first half so far the Raiders have done an excellent job with their cupboards not letting Denver get behind keeping everything in front coming up and making good tackles now this is two touchdowns in a row the first time they rallied up and missed four tackles allowing allowing them to get a short pass into a long touchdown this time just covers wise they're in the right coverage they just don't drop back and Sanders is able to work up that right sideline for a touchdown and Manning with two touchdown passes now in a 15th straight game and they are looking at that upstairs inside of two minutes to play let's take a look looks like a touchdown to me it doesn't you don't see the ball moving at all there's no even when his body lands in the endzone you don't see a loose ball moving around on that angle there the official runs right from the camera when you wouldn't he would be rolling over the top to see if there was anything loose the first angle didn't show anything from that angle he has the right hand underneath it you can see when he rolls over the right arm is securing the two shoulder pads bottom line is we really don't see anything that would change that call there has to be evidence to overturn it because the call on the field was touchdown so and if it stands that's 517 career touchdown passes for Peyton that for Sanders it would be his fifth touchdown catch of the season and suddenly just like that the Broncos have gone from being down three after review the ruling on the field stands touchdown about to go up ten 32 yards on the pass kick is good and the Broncos put 14 points on the board in two minutes and 16 seconds here you have a deep safety plant covered yeah yeah man here and he's gonna soften up in his coverage and Sanders is just gonna work up the sidelines Peyton recognizing that they're not getting deep enough they're sitting to come up and rally and make those tackles taking advantage do you notice the Sante doesn't 42 Asante doesn't get any depth even though he has that deep half of the field it's exactly repaid Manning attacked up that up that sideline once as soon as he recognizes that there's not giving the drop out of that safety or giving an angle on a drop to that he knew right away where is one with the ball you threw it with enough arc and Sanders was able to run underneath it located 28 seconds to play in the first half which has turned completely around in the last couple of minutes it's really kind of the way that the the Raiders season has gone then they had man it's things so well in the first half dere car got a little aggressive after getting pressure at the pocket had that interception that set up the first war and that one rolls through the end zone and as we just mentioned peyton manning now with 15 straight games with two or more touchdown passes in the game kind of made that a habitation well the fact that he's in two different uniforms dude that's the achievement more present twentyeight seconds on the clock out of bounds short of the 25yard line stops the clock with 22 remaining 20 of 32 for 209 for Manning and I'm just looking thirty two attempts that the Broncos have fourteen three snaps of offense in the first half that's a that's an incredible amount of amount of all kinds of snaps antiquated capacitance throwing again for McFadden working up by Marcia generally in a game you're trying to get 70 to 75 snaps of offensive play and here you are at halftime and you already have 43 so well ahead of what most most offenses around a leaguer are targeting 70 plays in an entire game and Denver on pace obviously to be well past that worth saying again this Denver defense thin in the secondary again being chased and had to throw away and von miller doing the chasing good pressure once again by the Broncos that is the fifth threeandout the readers today and that doesn't do much to accomplish the main objectives against in Denver Broncos neski Peyton Manning on the sidelines is offers possum well if you look at the ten points that the Raiders do have it's after the interceptions and so they had a short field to work with and they were able to convert those into points just now that tickles of papa meanwhile the clock runs down so what a turnaround in the last couple of minutes of this first half 22:10 denver at halftime we're back with the Verizon halftime report after this message and a word from your local station you're watching the NFL on CBS back in Oakland California in the first half the Raiders got off to a good start thanks to some pressure defense on Peyton Manning however number 18 came back strong couple of touchdown passes and it's a 20 to 10 lead for the Denver Broncos over the Raiders Manning has turned the ball",

talk about Murray and his hand injury while Romo force has had his own issue so it's been kind of a quiet story for him this week with his back at all but he told us he's feeling great on the right side however Doug free is going to be inactive with an ankle so Parnell moves into that position and Murray does indeed get the start you see them lined up right behind Romo there is they're gonna have to tie it ends to start it Hannah will join Whitney written will slide over to that right side and the Cowboys first now like it has been many times this year a handoff to DeMarco smeet greg keys defense and a punt Arthur Jones with his first start since week one he's missed some time this season burner we met with him yesterday the secondyear linebacker out of Florida State impressive Vontae Davis he's had his own health issues but he's just fine to give it a go here today Murray's already coming out after one play replaced by Joseph Randle we'll call it second and eight the middle supply it for a first down gains nine and Randall did a good job protecting his quarterback well both of the backup running backs do a good job of protecting in passing situations for Tony Romo comes up inside nice job of stepping out and get getting Erik Walden that's a big key you see this Colts defense what's the big key for them today just like I said in the opening can they find a way to shrink the field in the running game and keep it inside so those big defensive line they can make the tackle very shutters back in again is powered on this time is smacked around was what a sensational season has been for Murray by far the number one rusher in the league has the most carries most rushing touchdowns leads the league in scrimmage yards you look at that 1687 it's a lot of ones here when you talk about this offensive line it's athletic it's powerful I think it's the best one in the NFL that's why it's such a key against this Indianapolis defensive line and outside linebackers second and 10 and roll man stepping up tucking it under and sliding for about seven or eight when he pushed that to the limit really good job Tony Romo is excellent in the pocket goes forward goes sideways but then tries to get that extra yard and that was close to well Jackson gets a pretty big hit on him right away though you look at this Indianapolis defense they're not going to sit back because if you sit back against his cowboy offense I promise you you will lose they will march down the field on you here they are again gonna fake the Blitz or maybe the Cummings the best in the league on third down against the best they're down defense and Dallas wins the first of those matchups today well I see it as they didn't give him the spot I quite thought he would get whitney marked really close to the Changeling goahead signal moveth moving on down first down pretty quick judgment here as I look at both chains on each side of the field he's definitely passing the yard marker you can tell he's passing I think the official mark is on the cowboy sideline bird the short cowboy see a lot of that the talk to the red game would his clerk handle nothing there we'll lose a yard that time there was a big key Jason Garrett interested himself and seeing how DeMarco Murray carries that football today Jason Garrett and remarkable season leading these Cowboys who after losing right on this field week one against the 49ers all kinds of dire predictions about thatis maybe being a four or five win team this year now they have ten looking for the division second and 11 a Snapple in it and he's got first down yardage it reaches out there an extra an extra yard as he was being chased by Zack Kerr picks up 13 yeah it's a playaction pass I think Tony Romo kind of worried about the Blitz and that's why it looked like it was a busted play DeMarco Murray saw the Blitz to heck with the fate protect the quarterback that was a good job by him so couple things DeMarco Murray ran the football with pretty comfortable and did a good job picking up the blood side time building want to be aggressive Indianapolis does he didn't put it into that equation that Tony Romo could move out of the pocket Tony with 21 yards on it well that's a season high rushing for him and he is bounced back hit quickly by Chapman and now that's four carries for Murray for no yards football fans you can

of things to look at here T Jim this there's two pretty good corners here for the Annapolis folks and they've got the place of his single coverage on Dez Bryant Vontae Davis Greg Tolin how will they hold up Dunbar came into the game moved to a slide and that's batted down and then chase for a moment by Bjorn burner look at him how about that the Orang burner outside such a key in this game 92 reads it 280 pounds at one time now that down to 255 Jim and playing the outside edge a big key in today's game he left Germany in the 10th grade to come over and play football finishes education a little flag football over there was a wide receiver in a safety to be God no matter what to playing those sets third m11 for Dallas swinging over decades defended Freeman jerel Freeman pancakes Randall comes down right in the area they hit his Freeman made the tackle four yards behind the line of scrimmage after the play unsportsmanlike conduct auntie number 50 of the defense 15 yards first out you know you make a great play and then you take it too far and you give the Cowboys a first down when they were gonna take him off the field yeah you were it's it's really could be a gamechanger he had time to protect himself I thought maybe was going to be a personal foul hitting him in the helmet because he couldn't did have time do Dunbar to protect themselves but there's the taunting talking over the top of him went first to Dunbar was very fortunate to pin that football up against his shoulder pad it was close to coming out well they want to stop it Jim let's still my knives at boring going tough ah I guess the folks getting a little he's got 10 running behind Jeremy Parnell for 11 it's such a tough running game to defense they go sideways and if you over pursue that time it looks like to quell Jackson's a little out of position he gets blocked and DeMarco Murray he has a hundred decisions to make in the run game about 99 out of those hundred he makes the right decision five first downs on this opening drive of the game already picked up by the Cowboys and now from the Colts 26 nice weather get comfortable and he Wiggles too about the 21 couple of plays ago as he was shuttling in and out and shakes his hand for a moment you know he's a guy that loves to use the left hand as a stiff arm and he yeah he tried instinctively he was gonna go with it and they just kind of slid it above the shoulder and then something a new hottie says don't hit it yet don't touch it it's still a good start it's amazing surgery on Monday out here playing on Sunday a plate and screws inserted on Monday are six days later he's on the field I'll be up for a month second and six to the 5 Jason Witten has the cowboy setup goal to go from the fog anus 17 well when you put all your energy and stop in the run that means you're gonna have receivers down the field one on one and Jason Witten Tony Romo that connection how about the timing how about the ball placement when you have Tony Romo saying to us I'm playing the best I've ever played that's a lot because he's not a guy that Frank's nothing to so let's say those things nonchalantly he has really been on game football going these days that he knows the game cold with all the years of experience Marie looked like he might have a chance to take it home but he's pushed back after one and was a bit tackle by Tolbert it's a good job a lot of good things have really happened for the Colts defense are making some tackles you know he's trying to be aggressive of course the personal or the taunting those great minovsky defensive coordinator very aggressive knows what he's up against the best offensive line in football in the quarterback and wide receiver we Titans 15th play of this graph headless taken over eight minutes second ago touchdown Tobias the official is waving is if he's going to take it away illegal motion number 29 of the offense fiveyard penalty repeat second now if you're gonna go in motion then stay in motion here he goes he's coming forward so not enough time to stop and resit you've got to be stopped for one full second that was Tony Romo's fall not DeMarco Murray you know the quarterbacks got it judge it give him time to get ready brings the football back to the nine second and goal to go like to welcome the audience to saw the Texans come up big today victory over Baltimore Jim Nantz ville since Tracy Wolfson Cowboys have taken the opening kickoff and kept it now for over eight minutes at the end zone for the touchdown deterrence well it's a perfect play form Co Beasley on the insides going to go here and then watch Dez Bryant come underneath I'm sorry Terrence Williams but it's it you see the coverage it's too on to that side the field that is really tough and toll are not able to stay with me Williams seventh touchdown of the season Cowboys driving 80 yards to 15 plays late at seven nothing dear daddy stop field but the taunting call against Freeman gave the Cowboys a new set of downs they took advantage Roquemore with a touchdown pass eight minutes 24 seconds the longest buy time opening drive for the Cowboys in over seven years and I'll tell you why that that helps your defensive stats doesn't it you know for the Dallas Cowboys silver there for half the over half the quarter and typical Cowboys Drive dominating the last game bailey sends it through the back of the end zone now we'll see Andrew Luck for the first time luck and robo's they're meeting for the very first time today the chefs of Legends hospitality here at AT&amp;T Stadium the only NFL space with its own pastry kitchen as the Cowboys go down and scored a touchdown on the opening drive now we finally see Andrew Luck playing in AT&amp;T Stadium for the first time in his threeyear NFL let's start out with both Wayne Allen in Kobe panner his superb tight ends on the field tackle for a loss brought back about four or five yards by Tyrone Crawford loss of five will rule it right on the right side they've got two subs in today 14 and share of us are out so you got Lewis and Dixon and Donte Moncrief gets the call 40y Hilton who sits with a hand strength three wide all to the left ear for luck and the Colts second at 15 and once at the first two plays this time he's got one into the hands of Hitchens this Dallas defense of Rod Marinelli up front the likes of Mincey and this Crawford you saw on the first stop for a big loss McClain has got to be a candidate for comeback player of the year in the league this year and Scandrick given this team some leadership in that secondary the Cowboys have struggled this year at home three and four at home but this crowd is very lively at the start of this one third and 14 and they run it yet again this time in Richardson and the Colts will come off the field netting a loss of two on their three downs yeah terrible series by the Colts they were hoping to come out and run the football and slow this game down even more then you got to worry about a Jim you talked about it they get a new right side of the line Lance Lewis played but Savior Nixon a right tackle they want to protect the quarterback very safe a good start for the cowboy defense that they wanted to see this game slowed down the Cowboys offense did a good job of doing that maybe not that way again so McAfee to punt and he's gonna fake it control he had a open to a McDonald was in the flat and wide open McAfee was on target well that's another gamechanger he's there he's wife watching as the football gets deer he turns his head themed before it gets close to his hands and in the situation like this you just want to catch it with both arms cradle it and fall to the ground because it's such a dangerous situation that was on 4th on 11 the Cowboys take over at the 19 they lead the league as a team and drops the 36th of the year the Cowboys have the fewest drops of any team this is a team that first on site kicked a couple times early in the season successfully not talking about desperation onside kick right with McAfee successfully pulling those off but listen many times in fact they were ready for that Jim in other words that was a good call to change everything in his game the played was there but they didn't execute him and Dallas takes over in the red zone one for the quick strike Romo to the end zone and is pulled down for the touchdown and a flag Dez Bryant on the receiving end of it right off of three touchdowns holding number 28 defense penalty is declined touchdown let's look very similar to what we saw last Sunday night in Philadelphia with Dez Bryant the run game is so good you have to do this every once in a while on the outside you have to play Dez Bryant just you against me and you found out and I'm sure Drake Toller found out in person this guy's bigger stronger every his presence is big and he just goes up over the top makes the catch 14th touchdown catch of the season for Bryant who leads the league in that category should've been there the Cowboys take advantage just one play layer two touchdowns in two minutes and 13 seconds and since the beginning of the 2012 season Dez now the most touchdown catches over that span including the most this year alone Dez Bryant don't light you up two Romo touchdown passes that gets him now 30 on the season luck hasn't even attempted to pass yet as his punter has we're back with Dallas already up 14 nothing the Colts last week clinched their division with a win over Houston Cowboys take the NFC East if they're Victoria's here today swings it over to next and he's got five well Jim let's go back and look at that first down first touchdown 3d look at this look Williams coming underneath it up the defenders actually pick themselves and you look at it from every side and it looks pretty easy from that view good job by Tony Romo excellent play call and again many many times are gonna say it today what do you do you try to stop the run or the pass against the Cowboys you might stop one hard to stop the other little freebie they have here the technology of AT&amp;T Stadium as they go with nerim pachoo is wrapped up by Hitchens and the Colts will have a third and three coming up you know it's hard to believe the Cowboys have the record here at home that they do because their offense is terrific the offensive line the most consistent unit in the NFL in this defense it plays with passion they hustle they don't make many mental mistakes a lot of good things happening on this Cowboys team and they get their first first down and this open included with three minutes to go Pass is broken up by car he was trying to find Coby Fleener who looks around for a flag but he won't find one yeah it's just a matchup that does not favor the Indianapolis Colts a little bit of a pull but that's nothing didn't affect the pass or the route by Coby Fleener and you know Jim that's what you get team Y hilt now the game you might get some matchups of favor the cowboy defensive backs now I trust McAfee we'll be punting on this occasion they're doubleteaming it up they go doubleteam the outside pass was either is Sabu eris goes all the way back here that I was able to return at about 14 or 15 after 61 yard punt the new triplets in Dallas Bobo and Bryan and Murray come back out already up 14 nothing in the owners box today mrs. Jones there and then a second row carry on a conversation Governor Christie taking in a Cowboys game for the second straight week Charlotte Anderson the Jones daughter and then it's Smith Rambo gets to carry out to the 34 5 well Tim let's go back and look at our freedy here at AT&amp;T Stadium the safeties rotate Tony Romo looks to down the middle then he sees oh I got this right I hear oneonone look at that fight going on and then can he go up and make it look easy did you were saying earlier we saw that last week against Eagles when you give them that situation they're gonna throw it up to this right here that catch looked almost identical to the ones he snatched out of the air last week it's not buried on the sidelines here Randle got the first down carry here's 2nd and 5 and a flag is that what catch do by Bryant who's being covered by Vontae Davis tired of the pass holding number 21 defense penalty is declined go to the play first down 24 yards here Phil about the hands yeah boy the hands the front and size the presents and is he in bounds one he's in holds on him I love how you can just hold it one hand dez bryant well Chuck Pagano said we got it maybe doubleteam him some because he's a monster right he is just so big and physical and determined now for the ball he's got another first down gang up a block there to help spring him great job what's the free outside raw arm that Randall breaks there and that's what you have to do that was to quell Jackson the middle linebacker you want to keep that out then arm free he did it but can you bring a running back down with one hand at that time they couldn't against Randall they like Randy memory came in the game against the Bears his first carry those are a lot mentioned people miss that's going to touchdown and go here it's time for about two a minute to go in the first quarter let's go back to Tracy well thanks Jim it's like Jason Garrett told us DeMarco Murray will be limited and he was on the sideline when they took the field for this drive he didn't even have his helmet on and then he put it back on he sauntered over to the sideline watched a few plays he was grimacing in some pain and now he's just watching so it's something to keep an eye on guys yeah you wonder Thank You Tracy 14 nothing and driving again do you really need to have him in the game right now you know Jim we talked about a me put Dunbar and Randle in there they had been productive second and seven I open his Randle miss Johnson he's two yards short of the first maybe a long one but why would you right now if you've got a 14nothing lead you don't even need to run a play now to the start of the second quarter if you got a chance to expand the lead and keep worry on the sidelines today wouldn't surprise like that manage the game manage your players I'm sure that's what they're doing right down the fact that he keeps holding that hand up why to keep the blood out there and keep some of the pain away from the hand and we're 31 Tony Romo eight out of nine in that first quarter including a pair of touchdown passes what a rough starts for the call to taunt and call on that drop leading to the cowboy touchdowns all onesided after one here ten first downs to none to touchdowns for that much for team up and leave Jim Nashville since Tracy Dixon and he could have been stopped behind the line but he's able to shake it off pick up two in a first down it was early contact on him I've tried to be a chaplain so Randall getting this series and he's got four carries for 20 yards you want penetration in the backfield the Colts D line got it that time but somebody's got to be there behind him to fill the hole and stop the road whatever what is that zone for the touchdown Cowboys well they're making it look easy because it is easy it's just what do you do there clicking everywhere look at the space coby's Lee has LaRon Landry the safety was about 12 yards all puffing Tony Romo keeps the linebackers from getting underneath then you got tackle tackle him in the open space very hard to do Kobe's Lee man has really found his spot on his football team well that's his fourth touchdown of the season three touchdowns for Romo not even a full minute into the second quarter Beasley the homegrown kid from little elf high school and SMU Oh Beasley has had four touchdown catches in the last five games we saw him at Chicago he had a twotouchdown night this and again here when you got Jason Whitney Tony Romo DeMarco Murray and of course Dez Bryant he's going to see sustainable situations and he like I said he's taking advantage of the Bailey kicks gonna be run out by Josh Cribbs and he is taken down short of the 20 so Tony Romo has hit his last seven passes in three of his last five have gone four scores he's also rushed for 21 yards I was this second one the one to Bryant and then this one to Beasley who got away from the dwell Jackson Terrance Williams got the first score of the game make toss over the top and unable to hold on and the Colts have yet another drop well Anthony Spencer got dead drop didn't go for the fake that's the one thing about the Cowboys defense they might not have the overall talent to be one of the best in the league right now but they hustle and that play exemplifies everything stay in there doesn't chase the run and gets it a completion because of his presence the ports are down 21 and the not even picked up a first down welcome second down another drop bouncing right off the chest of Dwayne Allen tomorrow on CBS tis the season for a holiday episode of NCIS Los Angeles join in the fun tomorrow at 10:00 9:00 central only CBS there's 2y Hilton again not dressed out with a hamstring shaking his head wondering what the world's going on here burdened ten Knicks boys including goose Carter have hold of them and again the Colts will bring out the punting unit when you throw screens if you want to stop them can somebody outside make the runner hesitate there's a hesitation look at the hustle from behind look how many guys you try to get 11 guys into the picture I don't know if they gotta love them but they got at least nine so the hustle being fresh helping the Dallas defense so McAfee moves over he's number three in the league and Rose climbing average number two in the Nets Harris the proof two Colts are autumn including McNary bony Robo off to just a terrific start here as a way of barbecue down here in Texas our Tate style as the Cowboys have a ball again three possessions three touchdowns to this point they do have Murray in so so much for that idea that maybe they would just keep him on the sidelines he's got one well here's free D let's look at cold B's they look how far the defensive backs were off and then the pursuit you can't get mad about this you had three guys all in one spot good job by Beasley just slipping past them and getting the touchdown Andrew Luck with two completions to this point 12 yards 400 with three touchdowns he's got more on Whitney and jason witten takes it back to the Indianapolis side of the field and Murray that time help protect Romo here comes the Blitz look at the guy coming around how about that DeMarco Murray Murray got just enough the Blitzer to allow Tony Romo as own behind it and look how wide open Jason Witten is so the start of this game Indianapolis being aggressive coming after Dallas and Dallas has the answer every time going to Dez Bryant block the Blitzers not third catch for Whitney goes for 20 we're running it for the ninth time everyone so far for Murray today has come on first down and give him one that's 9 carries for 18 yards for Murray as we take a look at today's nationwide Skycam I think a lot of people wondered how the Colts would come out since they did lock up the division last week and there wasn't a lot of of a chance to to really climb out of the three spot and get any higher with both New England and Denver ahead of them both of whom have defeated Indianapolis this season look this score has nothing to do with the fact that they have their seeding lock done second and no his tactic finally near the 30 another 14 picked up you know Jim people are gonna say all with the Colts they end up them to play for they're not going to move up there to games behind all that look at the games around the NFL today and I'll show you the teams that had nothing to play for what they did so the codes they're emptying everything out at this Dallas office the Dallas offense is just too good this offensive line it's got Doug free at right tackle Parnell in there they've been playing again Murray first down carry and that's his second good run of this game most to another ten running behind Parnell and Hannah and Martin threw a good block as well give him nine well he could be more careful out there running the football with that left hand now because of the lead the situation but what it does it gives him a feel for this game and then really for the next because that hands going to take a while to heal we saw him at Smith earlier up in the owners box DeMarco needs 87 yards in this game to break in it's Cowboys singleseason rushing mark there's good hit on Murray after Arthur Jones back in the starting lineup defensive lineman for the Colts Emmett's singleseason rushing record of 1773 yards in danger of falling today course he's the alltime alltime rusher in the history of the league the great Emmitt Smith knows so much for charity here in the Dallas area Tony Romo really taken his time you know it's the right thing new 21 nothing slow the game down first and 10 he's nearly 11 so hard to keep them inside watch out here Jason Witten gets Newsome and Newsome cannot see what they call set the edge why is that important because you want to shrink the running lanes for the running backs of the inside linebackers and the defensive lineman can make the tackle once he gets outside that's gonna be a big game 8:22 go the cooler numbers in the cowboy is trying to take it for the fourth time to the end zone second and falling forward for one is Marie one thing that's changed a little already Jim I don't think you'd be surprised by this that they're putting two defensive backs looking at Dez Bryant now because one is not enough this is the part of the field to where you wouldn't be surprised to see Romo go back to him again so he's 45 away from the Emmitt singleseason cowboy record whereas Emmitt has peeled off so many outstanding seasons one second on the playoff burden one Walmart good time too many weapons down inside the one but it looks like he's covered with Tony Romo just Waits and it just sticks the football in there the quail Jackson is right next to him watch this you go inside here he is he's locked up all you need is a little space nice job up just a just amount of push off by Jason Witten to get open and a good throw Cowboys are gonna go with a fullback Tyler klutz and a tailback in Murray Murray who had two touchdowns on the ground against Philadelphia Sunday night at 11 on the season is a cross gonna touch down really good job Zach Partin did a good job Larry doesn't get a nice job putz goes in there or making it look too easy robos only missed one throw in this game twelve out of thirteen hundred and fifty yards and three touchdowns in this first cowboy touchdown on the ground not surprisingly Murray has his 12th of the season 28 to nothing Bobo and Dez are enjoying every minute of its the Cowboys and a wrong buck in the pit we start at the 20 they've been blanked in this game and don't even have a first down and they dropped three passes this one really was crucial down seven nothing set up the Cowboys who one play later got it in from the 19 on a throw two drops by Allen they have been gotten past their own 30 the Colts well they came in this game hoping they could run the football protect Andrew Barker and really help this offensive line out but so far none chants no rhythm losing the point of attack hit their depowered and they gotta find a way to get something going Richardson the running back playaction fake to him lock and goes to Knicks for five Hakeem Nicks the former Giants look like that's Cory ready saying this is embarrassing he's from Texas played the University of Texas have a terrific year but he knows when you can't affect the pass and hit dead end second and five the defender closin in on another drop that has three in this verse that would have been a wasn't an easy catch but certainly was one that you got to make it's going to go down the field the double tight in release this is really well designed I got have not seen that concept so it worked perfectly you got the defense they couldn't figure it out in time they switched positions pressure on look made the football come up short still should have been caught that was George Selvi who applied that pressure third and five and the Colts were not set both start number six the offense fiveyard penalty third down that was Lance Lewis the right guard getting to start in this one because Hugh Thornton's out well Lance Lewis is the guy in charge of hitting the sinner Harrison and telling him when to snap it but the crowd noise got going little confusion and he stood up just a tougher third down situation third and 10 retching Wayne the first down marker first first out of the game for Indianapolis yeah good job to get away from the rush protect your quarterback another screen on third down good blocking down the field but Holmes is in now at center Tim in common Holmes secondyear player out of southern town drafted in the fourth round a year ago had some injury issues that they've been going with the undrafted rookie out of Florida Harrison and leaner makes the catch we do a flag down back of the line of scrimmage number 71 that's on the right tackle again something today Nixon in for Sheryl Asst takes away the 22 yard pass play yes 71 top of your screen gets caught going backwards just the pass took a little longer Anthony Spencer just kept turning the edge and Nixon finally it took so long had to grab him but you can throw the football on this Cowboys defense to 30 23rd in the league against the pass they're not a great pass rushing unit you could get the time and five guys open deep downfield that defense so far in this game has given up only 28 yards passing 29 total yards by the Colts Brandon Carr on the outside two defensive backs I will say this form really good job by Brandon Carr keeping his outside arm free and making the tackle they are aggressive in coverage and they all are aggressive going for the tackle Rod Marinelli he just believes hustle know your job and they work on tackling every single day in practice it shows when you watch them play at second and 20 and that's Richardson so can I ask you a question Jim so I was asked this for the pregame today a lot of people say this you know can the Cowboys handle Prosperity you know now they've had success will they go to their head they have what would you say to that well I think they've answered that then already with 28 points old worn out twist shade yeah so whatever it does go bad against the Cowboys oh well see we knew they couldn't handle it third and 11 live in case Nana luck to Fleener he stopped the couple short what comes to the Cowboys a lot of people want to make some fast hard conclusions about him I know after they got beat by the 49ers week one on this field everyone was saying this team is going to struggle might be the worst team in the league he goes on and on this coach right here has had so much scrutiny when actually he should be somebody we're talking about now for coach of the year I agree because I think it was unanimous across the board with everybody in the media that the Cowboys not only they lose this year would be one of the worst teams he just missed the tip drill of course he also missed the ball yeah it is not a good kid the sidelines here let's see where they finally come all the way up to the 33 just a 29 yard boot for one of the best some of the Cowboys art collection here at the stadium and it's been something that mrs. Jones is very proud of taking that on done such a wonderful job of dressing up this beautiful stadium ok the Cowboys have three minutes to go here in the half Murray does not start this series at running back it's Randall instead and he gets it on the toss he was met pretty quickly by LaRon Landry for a loss of one in the Cowboys with a victory today would take the NFC East has been since 2009 the last time the Cowboys were in the playoffs they won the division title twice in the last 15 years I'm going to lock it up here and they're off just a huge start we're about five and we'll bring it to the twominute warning here who saw this coming Dallas 28 Indianapolis nothing coming out of the twominute warning Dallas with a third and six encroachment number 97 defense fiveyard penalty third down and he 31 Arthur Jones was the one who jumped yeah they were gonna blitz that time that's why Arthur Jones was on edge he thought he was gonna have a chance to get there and I know they were gonna blitz because everybody covering the wide receivers was backed off to try to make Tony Romo throw it short then make the tackle of course now that all goes away hard to get this cowboy team this offense you know in situations where you can take advantage of them because of their rut game because of the offensive line everything the scenarios that you draw always favor the cowboy often they bring in a new package out for the penalty that got clots at fullback Randle the running back Randle running and he is taken down by Jackson and the Cowboys will have to punt and timeout called by the Colts with 154 who knew that Santa was a cowboy fan Chris Jones it's to make a cameo in this game and that sails out of bounds Colts will have two timeouts and 146 to try to muster something before the intermission that AFC playoff pictures still a lot of things to be settled New England clinched a first round by with its squeaker over the Jets today 1716 dead Brennan and temperance ncinnati play tomorrow night Pittsburgh's in the playoffs clinched the berth today with its win over Kansas City and San Diego if it wins next Sunday at Kansas City the Chargers would be in how about that after last night's game what a job Philip Rivers false start number 71 offense fiveyard penalty first out with a lot of reports swirling that Rivers is playing with some pretty severe back issues yeah you know III believe that because last night he did have a little trouble getting started physically I thought in the game but man they threw it so much he got hot warmed up and once again Philip Rivers came through in the clutch we seen him good many times came back from 21 down just an amazing comeback by the Chargers his luck is able to unload it and it's Haren with the catch and they're gonna hustle after the seven yards they'll even even want to get this type of game because we just saw it the hit on Andrew Luck went down to the field or the turf hard that's made Coby Fleener illegal formation number 70 is not on the line of scrimmage fiveyard penalty to impede second now Vietnam is passing situations which are in right now Anthony Spencer got a second chance against Nixon and gets the big hit that what did he know the very next play he gets in the backfield doesn't get close enough to the live scrimmage him because he's worried about the speed on the outside so you back up and you get the play it's the second penalty of this first half against Nixon second and 13 they go ground trying to surprise the Cowboys and Aaron the only three you know you look at this Dallas could think about calling the timeout but no they don't you got to respect Andrew Luck in this passing offense they're so dynamic you call a timeout you could be helping them third and ten and nice catch that was Nicks and you've noticed that nicks has stepped up his play in recent weeks definitely looks like he's a great game shape and making some tough catches timeout Indianapolis Hakeem Nicks with a great grab his fourth of this game has given the Colts just their second first down inside of a minute to go second quarter and again there after that he's able to flip it open a heron gonna flag is on the field and heron advances to the 39 of the Cowboys goes for 22 great job by Andrew Luck got away from the rush Dillon's to the hands to the face number 26 defense penalty is declined don't overplay first out I know one thing they're gonna help have to help out Nixon at right tackle surly more on the outside that was legal hit him in the shoulder pad but looked like they'd hit him in the face that's why the flag was thrown first time today the Colts have advanced past midfield we put it tight in over there next to Nixon to maybe give him a little more time against it outside pass Wesley pocket seal lockdown nearly intercepted that was car almost came away with it but mom Creek broke it up coming up the Verizon halftime report with JP and the crew all the latest scores the highlights the firsthalf analysis some playoff the talk about who got in already today talked about the Steelers Packers punched apart through some big games week 17 second and ten it's getting us sounds and about the 35 good job by and rude luck getting rid of the football another free runner Henri monkeys coming Eddie but listen this is where the Colts are dangerous even with the score the way it is 28 to nothing when you keep putting the football in Andrew Luck's hands he's a down the field thrower he looks for big plays and don't forget the more he throws the slower that pass rush is going to give third and six with 29 seconds around them and forced the throw into the ground but another flag flags in the secondary holding number 42 defense fiveyard penalty an automatic first down hold on Barry church the one against Fleener puts both arms out yeah he puts the armbar so that's an easy call the one thing why did they want to run the football today this Colts offense force to protect a quarterback or try to protect the young offensive line but also when you pass if you watch the Cowboys defensive line and widen their Nellie he is especially changed positions a cross and it's very tough on any offensive line especially one in experience like the coach first and ten for the Colts approaching 20 seconds to go and in a gain of about eight at a time out Indianapolis it's the last one for the Colts 17 seconds to go fall of the 22 so Indianapolis cannot stop the clock again luck is hit nine of his last 10 and they put up something before halftime goes to the ends and he's intercepted it's intercepted by Wilcox who's running it across the 30 mix is waiting for that the 40's oldest poor and close out the half that's the first turnover of the game for either side of luck is angry at himself well he should be you know you want to get three here and they're playing safety fence all the way I think he's towards to the back of the insult thinking this guy go up there and knock it down but they were waiting on it they had the middle covered doubleteam both outsides and you got to be careful to protect yourself too j/k Wilcox with his third pick of the season the second year and safety out of Georgia Southern and let's go down to Tracy coach everything clicking right now what can you say about the start that your team had here in the first down well it's just the start is what I can say and that's what our players are gonna hear right now we got to treat it like it's zero zero and get back to work coming out here in the second half and he thought of playing it safe with DeMarco in the second half no I'm at DeMarco continue to play just like the other guys we're gonna finish this ball game thanks a lot guys they're up 28 and they're 30 away from the NFC East title 28 nothing Cowboys the Verizon halftime report is coming up after this message and a word from your local station complete domination the first two quarters for the Dallas Cowboys leading a twenty eight to nothing here's a look at the Bo's game changer Romo to Dez Bryant 14th touchdown catch of the season for Dez Romo throws for three touches Murray scores the other one and now the Colts will receive the third quarter kick after deferring at the start Josh Cribbs all the way to the end zone Baili sends it through the back you saw this one coming just like this did you sure that's your eat it I know I can always see all these games how they're gonna turn out what about the second half while you're at it well how about that listen there's no secret for the Colts here in the second half they got dominated physically and when you play a team like the Cowboys as good as they are you got to be perfect they made three errors that were just to themselves the interception into the first half that was three points the taunting penalty and the drop fake punt those could have changed this game around love 12 out of 18 12 out of 18 in the first half of 99 yards with that and that's nicks with his fifth catch let's go back to Tracy well thanks a lot Jim I asked Chuck Pagano how he digs himself out of this hole and he just said we couldn't get anything done offensively he sighed he said he doesn't have any answers he said the most frustrating part though what the penalty six of them and then I asked him about the fake panties that we just didn't execute he said ads for the defense we need to challenge their wide receivers in second and six and that's tipped at the line intercepted the Cowboys fiction's comes away with it so look picked off twice in a three pass sequence going back to the end of the first half well it's the push inside that's Nick Hagan and sometimes it's not about hitting the quarterback and sack of them it's about the pressure and when you push the pocket back it makes it hard to throw over the defensive lineman boy Andrew Luck he flies in there every time there's an interception trying to make the tackle Hitchens has had to play all three linebacker spots for the Cowboys defense and what a job he has done coming in and playing very well we were talking to Jason Garrett even back a few weeks ago in Chicago before a Thursday night game talking about how Hitchens our rookie out of Iowa has emerged and that's his first NFL interception we've had of course all kinds of injuries at the line back in position Marie for a couple he had a 40yard first half with a touchdown that was interesting why Jason Garrett said they're going to keep him in there and let him play and look they went all week the Jason Garrett tell us on our yesterday Jim that well I've read the papers actually he's gonna play you know we'll see but he got out there DeMarco Murray worked in practice Wednesday Thursday did moron on Friday what an accomplished he get to this game in play way he has as a cult waiting for him right away Bjorn burner he was actually telling his coach on the plane ride home from Philadelphia I'm gonna play next week and he says you can bank on uneven don't even think about it you know there's something to that you know what he did he just said of mindset and he was determined and of course he didn't know how the search is gonna go but once they said it went fine and says a lot about this team says a lot about him but the determination they've been determined all year long this Dallas Cowboys team especially on the offensive side it's carried this football team of the big reason while the 10 importantly that streets to the left this is Williams and notion third and 14 and he's going to be sacked back at 34 by Arthur Jones didn't take a chance that's a good job the sack was big it's gonna make it a long field goal but nobody open down the field as you look and the one thing about Tony Romo he knows when to go down he wants the receivers down the field the coverage is good but we talked about that too when you know you can't get away get down don't take the extra hits stay healthy and that's one of the reasons why yes building this line up most of the year it's 52 yards five out of six for the year from outside a 50 but not this time and the Colts will be able to take over at the 42 Bailey wide right from 52 unable to cash in off the interception the starting point of the day for the Colts who are reporting that Dwayne Allen has a knee issue questionable to return and Richardson has met behind the line by Rolando McClain well as Spencer in a loss of two now this has been the good stuff for Andrew this year tops on the league in passing yards most touchdown passes and at times it hasn't been so good 16 picks including two of those today well he's an aggressive thrower I do like that you take that and pressure two reasons why so many interceptions second and 12 and Wayne makes the catch and MacLean slams him down it'll be third down we got a cowboy injured back at the 31 and that's Henry Melton with a former bear they signed as a free agent in the offseason mr. Margaret hunt Hill bridge across the Trinity River in Dallas watched his stack whole moment ago by Rolando McClain and Jason Garrett told us every time he makes a tackle he makes a statement we saw it there Melton by the way was able to walk off under his own power third and five for the Colts will managed only four first downs in this game pressure on Locke and he got it away lose yardage and a flag is out again as Richardson makes the grab and again it's mcclain making another statement with a tackle holding number 62 offense penalty is declined fourth down Walden call on Holmes now Andrew Luck man could have been got hit in the face mask which any time you hit the facemask of the helm of the quarterbacks supposed to be a penalty but he has been hit many times here today hitting the ground people always around his arm but he sold the football a lot of dangerous situations for your franchise player and you can see that luck when he saw the flag but it's gonna be against the Cowboys he thought they were gonna call that man cookies punt bounces in on the far side we've got another penalty marker so we'll check the marker here's Lawton again Cowboys have been in his face most of the game field kicking team number 57 fiveyard penalty were being forced from the 20 yard line first down Dallas McNary flagged for that so the Cowboys will have a little better starting point than the 20 matchup Devils Sun Devils Blue Devils the Sun ball one of the great longtime relationships between the CBS television network and anyone out there they continue our annual visit to El Paso coming up Saturday and we look forward to CBS Sports bringing in the bowl season with Arizona State and Duke and all of our friends on El Paso through so many years to the Rogers and many others on CBS first and 10 still not town kind of put away from the first down the way they're gonna market you know we've seen the Colts a few times this year including against Pittsburgh and against look at this against Peyton bin and Tom Manning Roethlisberger and Brady they allowed 11 touchdowns in over 500 yards a game and 41 points a game and all the rest of the game the other 11 games they gave up 10 touchdowns total 11 in those three matchups well the defense has got some great numbers to get some of the other competition third down defense completion percentage call that stuff too right against the good quarterbacks a struggle not the post down cause Roethlisberger beat him up for six touchdown passes hurry up 248 yards with that run they do not have that elite pass rusher you know they have Robert Mathis out for the year he could change his defense dramatically because he could give them some pressure when they need an obvious passing situations and in your it's a it's a doubleedged sword now you're forced to be aggressive and when you're aggressive begins good receivers like here today hard to cover him one on one down the field first down Dallas playaction fake ceil pocket is able to again hook up with Dez Bryant for a first down right in front of Monta Davis pretty easy to see what he does when they throw any situation he's gonna look deep in case they played for the run they don't good job by the Colts staying back so Tony Romo oh my gosh look at that space he had to throw the football I mean there's not a there's not a defender within five yards of Tony Romo by the way Tony's only again from one incompletion in this game he's hit his last 12 passes well he talked about it he says I'm piercing the ball better than I ever had and Marie's running the ball Ben ain't better than he ever has in any of his first three other seasons and it starts with this offensive line to the Cowboys have emphasized in the draft in recent years well look at it nobody around him oh my god this is really because you see it's the second time do you understand why he's only thrown one incompletion but when he says here seem to ball what he means is how it's coming out of his hand perfectly but you know it's like hitting the tribal on the sweet spot every time that's what he does when he's flowing it he's his fundamentals he said they're great and they hold up during the game saw Jerry and Steven Jones with endeth joining them now gettin lost down by Freeman and a yard away we will just look at all those offensive linemen they went offensive line first round three of the last four years with Tyron Smith Travis Frederick this year Zach Martin and they scut to their game plan this year a lot of people thought no mo knows maybe logo Johnny Manziel with the 16th pick all the speculation they went right back to the line again that would have been a great move that's what they needed you know you got one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL yeah I know he's coming off injury but you got to build one part of your team that is super strong and for the Cowboys that's the offensive line 31 and they use that offensive line on short yardage in again convert you know purchasing as we were talking to the cowboy talking to Tony Romo about this offense and he said look he's got the experience now we know he's got the talent and the circumstances are right for him to put up the numbers that we see why because of the offensive line and whatever you do he has Jason Witten Dez Bryant they got their a matchup nightmare when you played this Cowboys offense Romo if he gets one more completion here would have the longest completion strength of his career is at 13 right now Morey slips between defenders gets down to about the 33 well they're just overpowered him now and you know the will sometimes leads you as you look inside sack Martin boy nice job just get such contact there so solid in there contact you can't get off the block that was a big key for this defensive line of the coach today and it's not come through and Murray comes back out I still can't get over what he told us a few weeks ago in Chicago how he consumed so much water 24 bottles of water in the 24 hours leading up to game time about 400 ounces is what he told a second and three for his street he's gotta have you know 14 straight completions that wonder Witten we've seen him have to move a couple times today in the pocket that time just nice moving in the pocket watch I keeps his hands on the football one of the reasons why he's so accurate is because he keeps his hands on it he throws with it's up the body which gets his legs involved and it's right on target so Murray back to the water story hands about ten pounds going into the game drinking all that water I've been trying it for the last couple of weeks yeah how's it working out I'm up all night you're gaining a lot of weight yeah getting mostly first and ten this time he is taken down for a yard loss well on Landry comes up to make that hit as we approach five minutes to go in the third quarter well this has got to be really disheartening for this Colts team the offensive line we knew was beatup coming in here I think they had up it just goes to show you I think the plan was terrific on both sides of the ball but takes more than just a good plan you got to have the guys to back it up and today the Cowboys just better than the Colts second and 11 zone touchdown Dallas Jason Whitney it's everything you want time to throw it look to the right nobody open then jason witten going down the middle of the field against the life actor watch how he looks to the right side doesn't like it even though Beasley is open but still nobody around Tony Romo that's impossible for Duke well Jackson to stay on Jason Witten that long Tony Romo with his fourth touchdown pass of the game Witten was their leading receiver last Sunday night and he is again here today his seventh catch for 90 yards of his fifth touchdown of the year on that touchdown throw Tony Romo just broke Troy Aikman's cowboy passing yardage blender boasted franchise this fruit 30 2961 yards and what a play to break the record on a touchdown pass to his buddy Whitman and the Cowboys are going to be seeing a new quarterback Matt Hasselbeck is replacing Andrew Luck who goes out with his Noah's every passer rating and again a 41.7 Cooper 109 yards and pick twice off day for Andrew as Hasselbeck hands at the Heron for one and you already qualified for the playoffs you're not going to win this game he's already taken some punishment so why risk your franchise player with the postseason looming yeah they would keep him in if they thought I guess the easiest way to say it if it was a safe atmosphere they were worried about it coming in today you saw hip helling the offensive coordinator in the score 35 to nothing you think this cowboy defensive line was worried about the run game the red of the T El Paso that gets it over who is driven back with authority by Carter and he look at the AFC playoff picture Patriots clinched a firstround bye with their victory over the Jets Indianapolis came in in the three position Pittsburgh's in the playoffs with its victory today over Kansas City San Diego will qualify next week if it wins at Kansas City here's the third and four Toad's pick up the clothes down the floor progress will be out of the 31 for Moncrief Tracy Wolfson down on the sideline it checked with the Colts personnel just a double check and this is just a coach's decision as suspected that luck just being pulled for safety sake and began the game the reach with dreams to go on the floor I think this Colts team when you look at what's caught on here today they thought that maybe they can run the football because last week when the game was on the line they need to get rid of some time off the clock at the end against the Houston Texans they marched the football down the field ate up a lot of clock had a lot of good runs and they were really hoping that was going to carry over into this week and it did not they brushed it in this game for two yards total 8 carries 2 yards for the Colts we have 100 that's uh NEADS up with sterling more gain of eight hey if you thought your fantasy season was over it's not you can play for free you can win a trip to Super Bowl 50 next season in Santa Clara joined today nfl.com slash playoff challenge Hasselbeck in a 16th year out of Boston College where it's the starter for so long in Seattle won an NFC title for the Seahawks took them to the Super Bowl when they fell to the Steelers up a Detroit in complete Bobble long enough by Wayne that the Cowboys defense actually had a play on a pig it's amazing boy it's contagious the football once players start start dropping it football comes out been tough for Reggie in recent weeks with a number of drops he's got that brace on his left elbow they just changed that apparatus this week to try to make things easier for concerete going for it NIC's and a flag on the Cowboys sterling more hands were tangled up pass interference number 26 defense first down spot of the foul the quick decision by man Hasselbeck goes down the sideline did look like there was some contact 5 yards to get past five yards you can't put your hands on the receiver like that push pull whatever it's a good call it's early more comes in a corner when three wide receivers are in the game because they're Lando Scandrick goes inside and plays either another receiver right now playing too tight in standard blitzing pass so back gets hit by stand wreck the ball was will then complete and Scandrick was already taken off down the field you've just mentioned him and he came around the right tackle and got a hit on Hasselbeck Hasselbeck wants to hurry him to the line because he thinks he might a fumble yeah it's close he doesn't want anybody to have time to look at the review or replay but here it is now the officials meet and they change their ruling their initial ruling and call it a fumble recovery Dallas you'll be looking at that here it is ruling on the field it's a fumble we're gonna Scandrick coming in and forcing that bumble which was recovered by selfie of the Cowboys after reviewing the play the ruling on the field stands it's Dallas his ball his clothes pills you know some might look at the safety I think the hand was just starting to go forward yeah you think that beneath the ball is knocked loose it looks like from Scandrick from behind and here's the recovery again initially it's but it didn't really quite play it out it was slammed down but then they ruled it initially as an incomplete pass three officials met and changed it to a fumble Mike carries back in New York did you see it that way to Mike well what I saw is that if I was reviewing this I would have to leave whatever they called on the field as the play that stands twopart review the past fumble they will fumble there was a clearly currently that's the way it goes all right weekend Randall working through a very small crack and picking up a found three vacant Mike Carey Mike well vandals stand Rex who did you start talking about he makes the play and listen he he might have one of the hardest chops on the team he plays outside on first and second downs or whatever and on third down well if you guys the league that plays the third receiver or the slot receiver which is extremely hard to do for a corner he's a vocal leader and he was telling us yesterday we're still not there yet we got to create more turnovers got to get better when they've created three turnovers in this game as quarter number three is down to its final seconds now boys inside of the forty with that throwed to Bryant they these are two pretty good corners they're catching these passes against Tony Romo it's like he hands the football to the receivers tension it is quite easy the way he's told the football Romo 18 out of 19 218 yards four touchdowns and setting today again the cowboy franchise record for yardage well the Cowboys are just a quarter away from erupting into texassized celebration the first post season will be cinched 15 minutes out their first since Bo 9 the division title will belong to them and by virtue of that the Eagles will be eliminated neither the Cowboys to lose here today they still have a chance pushback by the Colts that was Randall getting setback a couple here is the touchdown pass from Romo to Witten really good job finding Witte nice little double move down the middle that's why he was open good job by Tony Romo looking at all Bobo needs one more completion to qualify for the single game completion percentage record in NFL history slide at the 30 with a marker in the secondary down holding number 50 defense fiveyard penalty enforced from the end of the run first out well Jarell Freeman number 50 the linebacker against Jason Whitman pretty tough outside release going to come back inside and that contact is passed five yards a single game completion record again you have to have 20 attempts Kurt Warner for Arizona back in 2009 in the game he was 24 of 26 robos 18 out of 19 Randall and Adams read that one for another loss not trying to be funny but safest place in his Stadium for Tony Romo is right where he is not getting hit lots of protection a lot of time to throw and then even when he is pressured massive pulls for him to run up into by the way he came into this game tied with George Blanda on the alltime NFL touchdown list tied for 23rd at 236 whose move passed already in this game gonna link Lando when he was tied with a Jim Kelly and Lynn Dawson this is second incompletion nearly a pick and it could have been a run back for Sergio Brown yeah I think he saw the Blitz coming and I don't know Cole Beasley saw it comes from this side here it comes it in he's expecting an adjustment to the route and he did not get it well they've got a bad case of the drops on the offensive side and now the defense gets into the act that was the first incompletion remember Verner coming in and knocking out his first drive of the game and just a moment ago his second so Tony slumping now down at 90 percent for the afternoon mid 16 straight for that last one takes a couple of p\u00e2t\u00e9s women when a girl comes out Cowboys are there for the recovery it appeared we had it for a moment Randall got the first down yardage did the ball popped out and it stays not they rule it Jackson with the recovery 12 year run and a fumble looks like Williams was going to recover for the Cowboys but Jackson wrestled it away from them Cowboys have just turned it over for the first time today not the only thing that's gone wrong for him Randall coughed it up after picking up a first down on the run there the Colts have not been shut out on a regular season game in 21 years that's a span of 335 games they had 12 and a half minutes to try to extend that streak put something up here's the bumble Adams took it out of his hands you know look I don't know how Williams a receiver didn't get full control of that slipped out once he got on it it looked like he had it didn't the job by Mike Adams who Chuck McDonald says has really come in and done a fabulous job that was his words directing that defense when they need second and ten to the ground with Hera Aaron who started to see action just after midseason with the injury to Ahmad Bradshaw and here's a look at today's nationwide Skycam as you look at it talked to me a little bit about they know they're gonna need to run the football in the playoffs they were really emphasizing this and meeting with us last night they wanted if this game had become like a normal game they were going to be ground heavy today they had Haren they have Richardson can that backfield get it done in the postseason well you know no blame the backfield my answer is probably not you're gonna have to go with who you are and that's a passing football team and you put them football in the hands of and rely on the hands of Hasselbeck home third and Haddix sales past Hakeem Nicks you know Jim Estes talks up when you turn on him and run the football we'll all year long they've had a few spurts where they were I guess consistent but when the competition gets better they have a harder time running the football and hey you you throw it and you try to keep the defense honest by running the football and once you get to playoffs McAfee Harris on the run it's a past the 50 44 yard punt yeah they continue to push a jug a lot of frustration out of the field for one side there's a little Christmas spirit over in the great city of Fort Worth Sundance square here we are at AT&amp;T Stadium right between Fort Worth and Dallas in Arlington Tony Romo has been taken out after leading this team to 35 plus point 35 points or more for the third straight game Wheaton in at quarterback not only Romo is finished for the day but we understand Murry is also finished Brandon Weeden who filled in for Tony in a game this season against Arizona and the Cardinals came in here and beat the Cowboys in this Stadium you know also came in the previous week against the Redskins back on October 27th play very well against the Redskins you know get your first start with the new team against the Arizona Cardinals you saw him a couple weeks ago that defense the blood he's a convicted felon in 15 second at six let's go back to Tracy yes that's right Jim looks as though DeMarco Murray's day is finally done gloves off hat on talking to players on the sidelines smiling everyone asking him if he's okay he's just saying yeah I feel okay the biggest smile for Tony Romo Romo certainly no reason to keep him out there right now guys 22 carries 58 yards for Murray which means he'll go into week 17 Washington in the 29 yards to break the cowboy singleseason Rushmore covenant six wins touchdown Dallas perfect strike from Brandon week well that was beautiful top of your screen Terrence Williams and break toller's expecting a backup quarterback probably going to throw it short but the gameplay it is if you're going to bump the wide receivers they're gonna go team Roger Staubach visiting with Governor Christie Emmitt Jerry Jones Christie grew up as a huge Cowboy fan and especially a fan of Roger Staubach's has a signed football homogenous focus back in New Jersey 42 to nothing can you believe it waiting to Williams who is in for the second time today Terrance Williams the Cowboys have never shut out an opponent while scoring more than 40 points and grips behind the in line to catch it and then run it out there are the headlines the Steelers make the postseason with the win over the Chiefs they're gonna have a huge game against Cincinnati next week Green Bay's in they qualify and next week they'll play the Lions for the NFC North title Cam Newton and the Panthers beat the Browns today in Carolina and Atlanta week 17 will be playing for the NFC South crown because if the will be the Green Bay Packers hosting the Lions next week here's NASA back and Nick's is pushback by Wilbur and others it's like a preseason game now the Cowboys have brought in all the reserves we saw the backup quarterback Whedon I would see a lot of backup defensive players too got to feel good for Brandon Weeden to come on here get a chance to throw a strike down the field like that from outside of 42nd 11 raining down in the area of where NYX was the target I think you know the Dallas Cowboys very lucky unfortunate to have Brandon Weeden as their backup I like his talent he's got a tremendous arm you saw that fits this offense very well personal foul face mask number 20 defense 15 yards from the previous spot first out that's when the call for that and here's the last time we talked about it it's been 21 years since the Colts were last shut out and as a game against the Patriots at the old stadium up there in Foxboro shelves cold yep so that it's a twodoor Doyle able to stay on his feet for a first down it's the third longest streak right now in the league longest streak without being shut out the 49ers go all the way back to its third longest of all time you see the 49ers had a streak from 77304 the Denver streak is active folks have the third longest streak Tipton is in it running back the rookie from Central Michigan verlan Tipton sit back and that's cleaner and without by Spillman 6:16 continues Sunday night football tonight 8:30 Eastern on NBC Seattle at Arizona and tomorrow yes being a big one Denver in Cincinnati they both are look at week 17 Seattle would win this game tonight against Arizona that happens and don't have the West up the grabs next week the end the South only the Cowboys with a crunch to Division here's Nestle back with a flag on the able to get it over to Tipton what's on the NFC side illegal use of the hands to the face number 20 defense fiveyard penalty previous spot automatic first down here's a look at the NFC and again Seattle and Arizona we've already given a Cowboys the wind to get up to 11 and four now in the year Dallas beat Seattle earlier in the year at Seattle so they'll be rooting for the Seahawks to win tonight because they'd like to get matched up if you will record wise with the Seahawks because they would have to hit the head tiebreaker they lost Arizona the Cowboys did force Philadelphia because we've again already established that Cowboys with the win Philadelphia's eliminated half a quarter to go holds at the 33 of Dallas NYX spot him near the first on the AFC side New England Denver and Indianapolis had already claimed their divisions before this week Pittsburgh qualifies for the playoffs San Diego you never would have believed that at one point last night down 21 they would come out of the weekend they not only would win that game they come out of the weekend with the sixth position as Baltimore lost it to Houston what a story that is the case keenum being signed this week coming back home and leading the Texas to victory today and that's Hasselbeck being sacked it's Wilbur in San Diego if it wins next week at Kansas City it will be in the playoffs as a wildcard by the way Baltimore Buffalo Houston in Kansas City or all these teams needing some help especially Buffalo because the bills are down out in Oakland heading to the fourth they're out if they lose that game the bills second and 1750 planar coplanar told us something yesterday and a meaning very interesting in a came in as a second round pick teammate a flop said Stanford nobody knows those two go way back he had a hard time adapting to the NFL football until about this year smart guy grew up in the Chicago area miss the stripes on the football college they have the stripes easy to see when it comes down the field and he's had a very hard time tracking the football now look at those things they rub him up you're almost black some of the the footballs of the team souls he has adjusted he's adjusted to the league well he's definitely worthy worthy of a second I'm paying he's played well as he has been and tracking the ball patter as set pass was going back to cleaner but three Cowboys in the area fourth and ten and they're gonna go for it Rod Marinelli the old coach in a historian of the game who keeps photos of the old Cowboys in the meeting rooms he wants that shutout five and a half to go once his defense look how fired up he is if you break an assignment he's gonna let you know he goes there men you got to teach them so they can learn time out Colts they know how to take his coaching I think the Colts decide to take the time out set up a play here fourth and ten coming up I kick a field goal you just avoid them yeah bears would have a shutout I absolutely would I'll go ahead and hesitate I'd send them out there kick the field goal you go well that's not good gamesmanship well you know what what is games gamesmanship Cowboys shoe a long pass down the field up 35 to nothing elbows bent off the clinics and Hasselbeck goes deep and the Cowboys got the interception its car but a flag is in the end zone and marinelli knows what that means in all likelihood pass interference number 39 defense penalties decline so far not only doesn't get the pick he gets called for the infraction they got that mixed up it he means 39 defense he was thinking the other way yeah there's a lot of are you could see the left arm a branding car out there against Reggie Wayne and Bill levy obviously did not mean the penalty is declined they're set up at the 1 they're just too much contact lift arm in front of Reggie Wayne pretty easy call they've got a backup defensive player Andrew Jackson in the backfield 15 to 4 I so that throws and it's a touchdown for the Colts so 150 well you got black backup players in there when you do plays like this are gonna work down on the goal line there's no way you had a chance to work on this during the week it's like a preseason game playaction passes in the flat down on the goal line against backup players always work and a military who has not been seen since the opening hasn't been seen at all because even handle the kickoff sure so that's a first appearance ravenna tario has not missed a kick all season extra one good 524 to go and McAfee and the Colts are looking like they're gonna go ahead and onside kick it here Phil yeah me I'm a little surprised but you play it out to the end that's what they're telling us pink well they're not doing it after all if you've been right over the head of Harris tonight on CBS begins with 60 minutes and Scott Pelley reporting from Cuba followed by new episodes of Undercover Boss the Mentalist and CSI tonight only CBS Undercover Boss the mayor of Pittsburgh cover boss I thought that was Jim roar he's not undercover he's just the boss runs the city where's that city is today after his games took care of business against Kansas City first content hello freidy look at that Weidman touchdown throw Phil beautiful throw down the right sideline look at the arc of the football it's brandon weeden you can never say he can throw a pretty pass like the cities' an excellent downfield thrower just in a terrible situation in Cleveland like so many franchises they expect you to be drafted come in and get it done right away it's all he sees he blamed the quarterback and get another six Dunbar Sergio Brown right away the Colts are gonna see their fourgame win streak come to a close the story of this game today was Dallas offensive line to start protecting total Tony Romo so well that it allowed extra time he looked around the field he made the plays no pass rushed by the Colts but Dallas his defense that's what a good that has to get them excited the fact that they played so well against an offense they can put up a lot of points Dunbar in a market a little short of the first the last time Chuck Pagano came in here to take on the Cowboys he was the defensive coordinator with the Ravens going against the offensive coordinator of the Cowboys that day Jason Garrett's it was the last game ever played it old Texas Stadium right and Pagano and the Ravens came in and as he said it we spoiled their party Baltimore won at 33 to 24 it was at the end of the oh eight season the Cowboys cowboy party today the Cowboys were out to celebrate they could pull it off win a division title next Sunday through flexible scheduling then appellant CBS will deliver a doubleheader not exactly sure of the times and the sequencing of these games but we do know this it'll all start at noon Eastern Time with JP and Tony and all the crew they're already back there preparing for next week's NFL today at noon Eastern Time this is what the AFC playoff picture looks like that Cincinnati Denver game tomorrow night looms large and Tipton is brought down tackle by Mitzi look at the NFC side you see Atlanta over there in the hunt Atlanta will play Carolina in fact the Panthers will be in Atlanta and they will play for the division title hard to believe just the way both teams struggle all year long and you have a chance to win your division and go to the playoffs tipton down by Wilbur he loses a helmet for a moment by the way Seattle you saw an X by the Seahawks name they actually got into the playoffs qualified by virtue of this Cowboys victory it just starts shaking out all over the tiebreakers and everything that comes out of it you see DeMarco Murray visiting with the Cowboys a longtime executive communications director rich Dalrymple just cool it out on the bitch it was a hard day for Rich you know he put a lot of work in and he needed a break somebody eating some Gatorade having a Gatorade bath for it like that at the twominute warning on this 60 yard long screen they posted this and this crowd erupted no nail biting for week 17 this year for the Cowboys neutral film infraction number 93 defense fiveyard penalty third down still a lot to settle as far as the seedings at the top of the NFC and so we don't know what the cowboy situation will be if we're saying no they've got at least one home game as a division champ what do you think about their prospects this cowboy team it's for real solid defense but it's their offensive line we talked about a gym they dictate to gain so much you got to play on their turns and when you do that it's hard to beat anybody third and four bouncing off the first hit Wow in a head for another five and again tonight on CBS all new 60 minutes then Undercover Boss the final season of The Mentalist and CSI all new I know this meeting apple\u00eds Coates they got a lot of thinking to do how they're going to go into this post season we're gonna take on Tennessee next week Luke 17 now with his loss to guarantee the playing on the wildcard weekend as a host will the Colts will be either a three or a four well you know they played a good offense here today and they tried two strategies one to be aggressive that didn't work and then when they set back that one didn't work either so when you get the playoffs especially you know the teams were talking about Denver when you talk about Pittsburgh New England those are all really good office yes over to Tipton rookie out of Central Michigan who scored the Colts touchdown used a short while ago picks up another 12 time of year were people gonna really start locking in on things such as the most valuable player the coach of the year DeMarco Murray you know some lists have had him up there he's gonna win by a landslide the Russian title then he got Jason Garrett who I haven't seen his name again the storyline behind him always seems to be about where the Cowboys gonna do him in to do man play stuff got to put Garrett in Ariens right at the top Jim Caldwell until you're chasing geared up there because they're all naysayers to begin with so when you're against team how can you turn around say hey what a great job he's done most people who were against the Cowboys are still waiting for that one game when it falls apart Dan's own and incomplete at the last moment sterling more scripted out of boils hands really good job sterling more covering the outside receiver but his other job is to watch the inside receiver and that's Doyle so he has to come in and stop that type of pass a scene good play but surly more about some cowboy consideration on that MVP side with the Romo now outs of 32 touchdowns only eight interceptions I know you've got Rodgers and JJ Watt and Peyton then Tom Brady Tony well they would be right up there my eyes what he's overcome and how his claim seconds to go Jason Garrett and the Cowboys one last play and it'll be official Ansel back to NYX he's out of bounds and the Dallas Cowboys are the NFC East champions all you heard about coming in this was the last rank defense a year ago and they lost guys like Shawn Lee to Marcus we're then to freeagency the coach getting the chance to enjoy the ice bath and he deserves it well he does the organization the team chasing Garrett they've done a tremendous job with this team to really clean up from nowhere to be 11 for quite an accomplishment that I know CBS 60 minutes Undercover Boss the Mentalist CSI and Dez Bryant is jumping for joy Tony Romo as a record day here 90 percent throwing franchise record yardage four touchdowns Dallas demolishes Indianapolis 40 to the seven for film and Tracy Jim man saying so long from Dallas you've been watching the NFL on CBS and right now let's go to James Brown in New York",

  "transcript": "Miami was going to really struggle to contain him but what they've started to do they're winning the oneonones outside Cameron wake Olivier Vernon they're making it tough on the Green Bay Packers they've done a nice job against Eddie Lacy in the run nothing from the Miami office they've got to give their defense somehow because the time of possession is clearly in the favor of the Green Bay Packers Joe Philbin on the sidelines with his defensive coordinator the Dolphins punting here on 4th down there's 30 seconds remaining in the first half the Packers took the opening kickoff drove 80 yards for a touchdown on a precision light Drive since then there have been no touchdowns each team with one field a fair catch way for tried to doubt it inside the five the ball goes in the end zone for a touchback we talked about that defense that goal that was the third down Tanna pick filmin keeps his offense out there knowing you're gonna have to score a lot of peat points to beat Aaron Rodgers but the Green Bay defense much maligned early in the year they're playing really really good defensive late dolphins wasted a couple of big opportunities they had the ball on a good kickoff return 54 yard return started at the Packers 49 couldn't punch it in they got down after an interception how did he got down with one yard line and unable to punch it in again because of the defensive play by the Packers you really have to credit this Miami defense though because we talked Aaron Rodgers came out scalded he was really hot but now they're starting to contain them a little it's all about that wash up front Tannehill clearly struggling the one thing though taking advantage of opportunities I always knew as a defensive player when you playing the great ones and Aaron Rodgers is that you better take advantage of your opportunities dolphins will let the clock run out rather than the Packers let the clock run out the Dolphins will get the kickoff to start the second half halftime Packers lead the Dolphins 10 to 3 to have some purport here's Curt Menefee good football game here in South Florida with a Green Bay Packers led by Aaron Rodgers leading the Miami Dolphins 10 to 3 today's excitement is brought to you by Nissan and it's been the Packers defense that has been outstanding two interceptions giving them nine to lead the league in the season Sam Rosen John Lynch Pam Oliver here in South Florida with all the talking we've talked about the Packers dominating things dominating time of possession it's still a one play away game for the Miami Dolphins that's ten three and I think you have to credit the deep that the defense of the Miami Dolphins for that they've been on the field a bunch Aaron Rodgers started off really hot the pressure started to overwhelm him I said earlier well everyone's got a kryptonite I haven't found it with Aaron Rodgers even him pressure pressure off the edge Cameron Wake and a olivier vernon are delivering for the Miami defense now the Dolphins get the ball first and start the second half what do you look for for their offense they got to get Mike Wallace involved I think they've moved him around they find a way to get the ball in his hands and let some things some easy throws for Tannehill that ball bounces enansal Jarvis Landry takes a knee we go to find out what the coaches are thinking here's Pam Oliver well Sam Joe Philbin wouldn't go into too great a detail when I asked him about Ryan Tannehill and he cannot afford those turnovers he said we have enough problems to go around he said our office just is not performing the longest run play for the Dolphins in the first half was not Miller or Marino it was Tannehill he says that's kind of unacceptable but at least it's just a one possession game Mike McCarthy he says our offense will pick it up he met their goal of time of possession special teams wise you guys he wants to take the run in the third quarter actually thanks very much Pam Ryan Tannehill on first down outside the Dion Sims the tight end pickup of five on the plate from on Williams on the coverage Ryan Tannehill down 9 for 17 89 yards two interceptions and you see the numbers there first downs edge to the Packers total yardage to the Packers time of possession will that be a factor late in the game we will see we will see but you know I think that first player it's a good adjustment Miami Dolphins quick easy throws for 10 Hill so really technical whatever for me backpackers the fake no son Moreno and Tannehill wasn't great Ron what's in that read he's reading Clay Matthews Clay Matthews crashes down remember a college wide receiver watch him outrun Morgan Burnett a safety who can run good hustle by Mike behind to bring him down 40yard run for Ryan Tannehill but he still got it the longest run of the day for the my resentments but I think Joe Philbin liked that one so now the Dolphins in good position play the Tyler motions Danny Hill gets private puts it up deep his the Passover Thoth intended for Mike Wallace let's see if there was it it looks like interference on the Packers the Vaughn House was covering Mike Wallace on the play and talked about it you knew they were going to try to get Mike Wallace involved there sputtering offensively you turn to your best players and he's that for them at the wide receiver position but we've seen a couple of best in understand field defense number 31 late in the first half and here to start the second half Tannehill going deep well that's late in the play that the pass interference happened earlier in that play yards on the penalty first down at the 14 though saw Moreno cuts it back and as inside this 10 to the 9 yard line miss peppers were the first hit on Murano making his return to the lineup looking better for the Miami Dolphins offensively moving the ball down the field we saw tannenhill run it and really one of the first positive runs from the running backs in Knowshon Moreno second time the Dolphins have been inside the 10yard line second and five I think it's Rendon Albert the left tackle moved early false start offense number 71 fiveyard penalty well second down the good news is branded Albert back after being injured late in the first half Ryan Tannehill tries to hard count he sees the pressure does albert coming from Devon house by Matthews but they're still on side so false start ball back to the forty second and ten the screen pastor and about the six yard line from on Williams taking notes on Moreno out you're gonna see the motion by Mike Wallace the fake over to Wallace and then the screen creating some space that's what you do with your good players you not only throw to them you use them as a decoy Tannehill does it and does it well gets Knowshon Moreno some space some positive yards start to happen for Miami you see if they can punch it in here's third and two Randall shifts back in the backfield some movement on the line and false start against the Dolphins ball start offense on the 75 yard penalty second down that time it's the right tackle JaJuan James the firstround draft pick out of Tennessee but very similar that looked prior to that penalty again Dom Capers so you're not going to run on us you got to beat us throwing the football they have the oneonones outside and we'll see if the Dolphins can take advantage of that the laser on the offensive coordinator Mike McCarthy pacing the son of the third and seventh of the Dolphins the cuttings niblets the end zone first NFL touchdown for the routine tournaments wind rain looking to tie it up capers dials up the pressure it's been very effective but nice adjustments by Ryan Tannehill Miami Dolphins you see the olive once you lofts it up gives Landry an opportunity to go up and get it Landry delivers for Ryan Tannehill he's been a factor in this game as Jarvis Landry extra point is good Caleb Sturges it's command of the locker with a strong Drive and the touchdown pass to the rookie draw the slacker today's game is sponsored by Southwest Airlines without a heart it's just a machine by DIRECTV if you call yourself a sports fan you've got to get DIRECTV by Taco Bell sometimes you gotta live mas and buy the Dodge Challenger or Dodge the big play on that drive was the pass interference on Devon house I thought it was going to be illegal contact because it happened so early in the play nonetheless there's the penalty 21 yards good adjustments by the Miami Dolphins they found a way to get their players the ball in space and Ryan Tannehill answered the call as well Burgess picked off in the endzone hit the upright but dolphins good start and a half they needed something from their offense and they finally got it and Jarvis Landry's had a nice afternoon couple of good kickoff returns and then coming up with a big touchdown catch he's really impacted the game as has Davante Adams so the rookie wide receiver is shining today now let's see what the Packers look to do offensively there's Jarvis Landry secondround draft pick a tavella's you backers first possession of the second half first time they got the ball in the game to start again they went 80 yards for a touchdown with Rodgers hitting Jordy Nelson Eddie Lacy the running back really clean it's racing good run as Mike McCarthy wants to keep trying that running him and didn't get all that much but trying to stick with it Wow Mike McCarthy knows a couple of things first of all they've got to tired Miami defense they've had him on the field a bunch number two they're struggling to protect Aaron Rodgers on the corner so great answers run the bowling ball Eddie Lacy right down their throat nine carries 29 yards for any lasing Packers first down at the 30 yard line he picked up ten on play time tune is the pullback in 18 they go with lacy again bucks that time Dalton strong up front maybe a yard yard to half on the run Jelani Jenkins leading the charge defensively for the Dolphins against Minnesota they really got the offense the run game going with 156 yards two touchdowns but today it's been stuff going against the Miami defense second and nine Rogers pressure from the outside gets away Bates Jones Rogers taken out of bounds slipped along the sidelines at the Miami bench shoved out of bounds by garudadri this is where Aaron Rodgers is so good if you just took him as a pocket passer he'd be one of the best in the league now you add this dimension lets him full Rashad Jones with the little pump but what an athlete what a quarterback what a player Aaron Rodgers is he can beat you in so many different ways and just for the record six runs 27 yards for a turn Rodgers in the game first down backers of coke energy lacy stay on the ground and it looks like part of the plan is to wear down that miamidade defense well they got the time of possession clearly in their favor Mike McCarthy knows struggling to protect they've got a tired defense keep running out keep running out because what happens those two yard gains become five become ten and they're gonna keep plugging with Eddie Lacy thinking that he's gonna pop the big one Kevin Coyle going through that play sheets him how do I stop Lacey how do I stop Rodgers two tight ends in Richard Rogers Network case two wide receivers to the light it's racing but patience is a runner by any lacing didn't look like anything was there waited a little bit and picked up for up to the 49 yard line a good patience by Mike McCarthy the head coach also the offensive play caller stand with the run it's just it's hard to do when you've got such a talent at the quarterback position but it's important because that's how they make their plays you see 5050 little tilted towards the rush now watch here comes run accented Jordy Nelson forgive me on backers we return got from stocking Jarrid a drink right in the middle of the line with a strong play artery right here he beats people with quickness and penetration quickness just shoots the gap outstanding play by Jared Audrey lemme see there as well and the Packers are going for it on fourth and one this really really surprises me no he's got a lot of faith in Aaron Rodgers wonder if he's just going to try to hawk down oh geez still has it the pass was clocked by Charlie Nelson throw first down sometimes you just have to tip your hat to the opponent because you cannot defend that play any better and the Packers still convert there's a flag on the play take a look at Cameron wake does his job great crimes with just excellent coverage but Rodgers fits it into Jordy Nelson there's bill benefit holding defense number 24 Finnegan and it is a Packers first down at the 45 yard line just short of the 45 Mike McCarthy with the gutsy call I really didn't think they were gonna prize huh she has to be gutsy to win the game tied at 10 and the packers drive started it to 20 and they have been grinding it up to tight ends in game starts the running back and John Thune the fullback wheel 18 there's ways that kids became starts and he fights his way down from 4 yards we've got an update from Joel find in LA Joel what's happening say let's go to Buffalo where Tom Brady is finding some new weapons Brian Tim's yes I said Brian Tim's first reception as a patriot in the number 84 I give a little moss right there 22 7 New England in Buffalo Sam and John Lynch Brian Tim so we'll see do England in two weeks against Chicago Patriots are 3 &amp; 2 coming in in trying to take over the AFC East lead Dolphins are too and to buckle cranky and start Rogers bringing outside that come Terk passive a big gainer and the Monday others with an impressive game watch James Starks come up on the Blitz pick up gonna pick up Jimmy Wilson that gives Aaron Rodgers time to do what he does best break the pocket and here's what the receivers do best for the Green Bay Packers break tackles Courtland Finnegan got to make that tackle the yards after the catch always a big part of the Green Bay Packers offense now the factors were the first down at the Dolphins 18 yard line start still running back Seavers in everybody else Watchers pros too 14:06 about bid again as he was cutting across the middle from luis Delmas to safety that's how you play the safety position luis Delmas you let them know they're gonna come in your area they're gonna pay Jordy Nelson knows that not so sure eyes off the ball instead eyes on Delos I don't blame you Jordy Nelson on the sideline collect himself after that hit two tight ends in till the backers the fallback and there are lots with a play clock winding down calls a timeout backers trying to regain the lead a good drive use the timeout week six in the NFL continues later today on Fox for some of you on CBS tonight Sunday Night Football on NBC Giants and Eagles tune in tomorrow night Monday Night Football on ESPN 49ers and Rams in a big divisional matchup back for second and ten at the Dolphins 18 simba back three wide receivers samosas that we want out boxers 220 Nelson down for the 7yard line good effort by Nelson collected himself on the sidelines was able to come back into the game these are just the subtle things falling forward Rick Grimes looks like he makes a great play not so fast Jordy Nelson keeps his legs churning falls forward they do the little things in Green Bay and they turn into big things six catches 53 yards for Jordy Nelson in the game with one touchdown and the Packers first and goal at the Miami 7 this drive started at the Packers wanting to tight ends in Boston it's true in the format it's a couple of yards just across the 5yard line Khoa me see with the stop for the Dolphins Mike McCarthy told us coming into the game he said I'm gonna rotate my backs we're gonna feed Eddie but we're gonna put Starks in there we may put two on Harris and we're gonna even see John Coon run the football and cooed has now four times a lot of carries for the fullback rookie wide receiver Jeff Janis is in the games wide receivers for the petunia watch it big rush look like Carl Mitchell got that big right hand out there or maybe use Jared on trick like it was Jared honored Audrey kind of stalemated at the line of scrimmage I think this is a touchdown for Davante Adams that he'd not deflected it the fine job brings up third and we continue with for wyvern anyways he in the backfield Rogers steps up crying time keeps it alive what an amazing play by actors regain the lead that was unbelievable I mean the Miami Dolphins defense does just about everything that you can do they get instant pressure Aaron Rodgers eludes it running to his right exactly what your coach not to do rolling your right throwing back across your body good coverage by the Dolphins but here's what Aaron Rodgers can do Tia he extends the play sits it back to Randall Cobb what a play and you see Jordy Nelson pump his fist and Brent Grimes hang his head the Packers 13 plays 80 yards in eight minutes seven seconds that may pay big dividends later on they regain the lead at 17 to 10 today's game is sponsored by visa checkout the easier way to pay online back in South Florida where the Green Bay Packers what a drive and what a finish to that drive by Aaron Rodgers really unbelievable the time of possession already tilted they go on an eightminute plus Drive finish with the touchdown big fourth and more than that drive everything you could ask for line drive kick by Mason Crosby through the end zone touch back here's why Randall Cobb s seven touchdowns he stays alive knowing that Aaron Rodgers can deliver and here's why Randall Cobb in the slot here's how why he has seven touchdowns he knows Aaron Rodgers has a gift he can keep plays going watch him continue to stay alive go to the right now back to the left you find the open space and only ever hunters can make that throw great job by Randall Cobb unbelievable by Aaron Rodgers oh by the way Aaron Rodgers with 14 touchdown passes this season in the last five years Datsun starting from the twenty they stopped to play one of the Sam Shields is down on the field it was literally just walking out to his position and just collapsed just don't see that Sam shields right before the play they get the timeout but just walking out and fell to the ground oh boy all the sudden you saw the Packers asking for timeout backers have a 1710 lead concerned for their quarterback Sam fields there's Sam shields you're going to see him come out of the stack there and just trying to come off the field and then he just says I can't I got to fall to the ground Packers have used two timeouts already here in the second start from the 20 mark Miller Barn fiveyard pickup for Lamar Miller Sam by the looks of that it I've got to think that is that dolphins go up tempo that Sam Shields hurt himself on a series before a different look here by the Miami Dolphins the bond houses in the game there's a strange formation and they throw it outside from and our mind turns it into a nice gain up to the 38 yard line and there's a packer injured on the play they come from 13 and is also a flag down illegal formation offense under 71 five yard penalty we're be first down so you never saw it before John they got off its alignment out there there's 71 he's got to be up on the line of scrimmage this is something out of the Philadelphia Eagles playbook but even a bigger story a development story chef Sam shields just went out there other starting quarter Trahan Williams now down and injured the Packers are deep at cornerback but not this steep to be able to sustain losing both starting quarterbacks ad Casey Howard a hayward and Devon house in the game along with Ramon Williams and here's the tangle meant with Brian Hartline and Williams stays down so we just saw shields go off now you got charm on Williams remember early jump tamari a lot of more the inside linebacker went out so Green Bay starting to sustain some injuries Williams lumping cross field with a little help backers have in the game Jared Busch five defensive backs in the game the two safeties Morgan Burnett and ha Clinton decks lavond house Casey Heyward and Kerry Wood Mike McCarthy and Dom Capers have at their luxury all these guys have played a lot of football Devon House has been rotated in Casey Heyward was their starting nickel he's played and Jaret Bush has played a lot of Defense for the Packers in the past the Dolphins with a second and ten at the 20yard line backers with a 17 to 10 Lee no where is the running back he was down by Pannell the nose tackle had him he was almost down he got away and turned it into a 25 yard game Ryan Tannehill says Aaron Rodgers all right you're pretty good but I can do some things to gets out of a hairylooking situation rolls to his right throws back across his body for big yards to Mike Wallace that's a play make a nice play by Ryan Tanika 12 420 133 yards and he's offended by Clinton dicks into Packers territory first down at the 41 yard line nice play they catch him in the Blitz they find the gap watch out Dix finish this play boom coming on the legs are the defense is wearing down a little bit the offenses now I've been running the ball and the Packers are getting injured they should have been wearing down because they haven't been on the field that much today but Miami starting to get some rhythm offensively rocky in motion and handle Miller get down to four yard game let's go for an update to Curt Menefee Curt what's happening well the battle for first in the

Hill continuing to show some playmaking ability Hey make it happen fire the way right right there's a big served up women's number 34 s in the background for the Dolphins of running back getting William to assign this week USA good protection I think JaJuan James the right tackle gets away with the hold right up there but Ryan Tannehill says thank you very much the Dolphins on the bow the offenses have come alive for both teams the Packers lead 17 to 10 end of the third well plays work a lot better when you get great protection and a little holding go ahead Tannehill he doesn't mind just a little hold this a little old but Ryan Tannehill hang it in there and really starting to play a lot better than he certainly did in the first half Sam rosandjohn Lynch Sam Oliver here in South Florida you see the numbers picking up there were only three possessions so far in the second half by a B went 80 yards the Packers went 80 yards now the Dolphins have gone 55 yards first down at the Green Bay 25yard Hill under pressure try to get it to Charles playing went off the helmet of the linebacker Brandon Jones outstanding job by Brad Jones getting down the middle of the field Tannehill

seven carries 30 yards five Morgan Burnett with another stop but another big run all he's doing is reading Clay Matthews Clay Matthews is gonna go up the field then we're gonna hand the ball off and he's gonna crash down Tannehill will keep it by those holes so big jump that's that read option it plays plays tricks on a defense second and one while the Dolphins at the 5yard line motions Network air he's in touch they're blocking up front outstanding blocking and Sam you asked me is the Green Bay defense get worn out at time they had been on the field but now they got hands on the hips this

balance and turned it into a big gainer a 25yard pickup right on cue after Pam's report your corners are out what do you do you go after their backups and Mike Wallace makes good on that choice to go after Casey Heyward casey Heyward misses the tackle first down Miami at the 45 yard line Ryan Tannehill 7 for 8 here in the second half 15 for 24 in the game Lamar Miller he's across midfield and the Dolphins we talk about the Packers getting a good mix earlier in the game they've got a nice mix in their offense going they sure do and it's gonna be interesting to see we've seen early in this game Dom Capers very much was saying Tannehill is gonna have to meet us throw on the football now with both your corners down are you gonna be as bold and stopping the run because you leave those corners exposed said I've been five it's Miller on the play the short of the 46yard line the toy guy on were the first head an important third down play coming up for the Dolphins this is where you want to be with Ryan Tannehill third and very feasible situation he's third in threes third and four bill laser the offensive coordinator joke and told us we're not far enough we're not a welloiled machine in our passing game yet we need to keep them in manage third down situation daughter's won't rain Tannehill Brad Jones missed the tackle turned into a 20 yard game one thing you have to do against this offense is defeat defend the entire field sideline the sidelines they get the ball to their players in space now it's about making the tackle Brad Jones is there he doesn't make the tackle big game for Lamar Miller the enemy in perfect stride and Milla had top speed as soon as he caught the ball Damien Williams in the backfield now for the Dolphins of Ryan guy that helping watch Williams picked up the plates this is Jarvis Landry he goes head over heels by KC Hayward but its first and goal to the Dolphins Ryan Tannehill looks opened in that first half and I really credit the young man because he came back whatever he did at halftime he's got himself in a rhythm he's throwing the ball very accurately he's making good decisions a lot of credit to Ryan Tannehill and Jarvis Landry having himself an outstanding day Landry with 4 catches 60 yards including his first NFL touchdown first and goal the fake Tannehill made the catch let's see what reply agains holding defense I think this is going to stand Dawkins lady for the first time to the game Wow Ryan Tannehill talk about Aaron Rodgers extending the play watch him step up in the pocket Wallace play in this second half dolphins have had three possessions and all three have ended in touchdowns thrives of 80 80 and 79 yards there was the hold and Wallace just kept on going gonna lead for the extra point has not only kept pace with Aaron Rodgers he's passed the Dolphins limit today's game is sponsored by the new Samsung Galaxy s5 the next big thing is here we are back Miami we're the Green Bay Packers have found the second half really really tough however when the pressures on you like to have Marin Rogers on your side we sure do but Joe Philbin this man Ryan Tannehill stepping up right now we talked about a litmus test in this second half he is shining one Harris watches the bounce through the end zone second half the game started it was Aaron Rodgers dictating things he started the game six for six with this second half brilliant performance by Ryan Tannehill I said in the first half Aaron Rodgers came out scalding Ryan Tannehill scalding in the second half think it really have to credit this Miami defense they kept this team in it in that first half they were on the field a bunch they kept them in the game and now Miami found themselves offensively to find themselves ahead John anything you see in the Miami offense with the adjustments that they made at halftime they started fine in that space that's what this offense is all about get it to their playmakers in space doesn't that that starting quarters for the Green Bay Packers have gone down as well Randall Todd opening Cameron wings this guy really good player not only the sexy stuff second cornerbacks but just doing his job staying home when he's supposed to stay home he's been outstanding today second and ten with Aaron Rodgers Rogers falling short and wide James starts circling at the backfield told me see the middle linebacker had him covered the Ole Miss he has given his defense a lift as well his presence in the middle it's big he's been awesome Roger stop in the road and covers you can say it pressure building on the Packers on third and ten watchers catch time and throws had fun study Nelson first down big big play Nelson's seventh catch of the game well here's protection when you give Aaron Rodgers the time Bach Thierry really working hard enough time for Aaron Rodgers Jordy Nelson they talk about second and third reactions when he extends that play how you gonna react to Jordy Nelson and Aaron Rodgers so NSYNC no panic by Aaron Rodgers he waited waited twenty two yards we PASOK came to Jordy Nelson n do dolphins territory down to the 43 yard line a 14yard pickup there that release Sam it's just it's Marino like I played against Dan Marino and that was the quickest release I've ever seen it still is but Aaron Rodgers a very close second and just when he makes that decision that falls out fourth time this season Jordy Nelson has had at least nine catches in the game that play across the 40 Randall Cobb brought down at the 46 yard lines the Liz delmas covering on the place and now the Packers but that big third down pass has really gotten their offense going again second into it's gang starts cuts it back nice rod horse down Packers at the 27yard flies first half was dominated by the defense's second half the offenses are both in sync and I think the defenses are both getting a little bit tired and the offenses have done a nice job of staying with the run the body bills body blows and now it's starting to open them all to the big books in the past game no huddle offense starts going the other way reversing his field and gets down to the 17 yard line Packers have a really nice thing going they've got Eddie Lacy when they want to go north and south then they have more of a slasher with James Starks nice job by just sit in the left guard little misdirection the run game starting to pay dividends for the Green Bay Packers force down at the 16yard line since beta Richard Wiseman it starts it's a loss of a company yards back to the night scene Olivier Burton with a good play watch Olivier Vernon he's doubleteamed right here with Bakhtiari and Richard Rodgers and he's gonna split that doubleteam and go make the tackle in the backfield very nice play loss of three on the play in the backfield Rogers Rashaad Jones with a big tackle down into 12 by the gain of 7 on the play shot Jones is a guy that they really feel good about Aaron Rodgers again extending the play he's got a lot of space textbook tackle from the Shot Jones breaks down brings the arms it's good stuff Jones out earlier came at that time third and six for the Packers everybody else Ronson snows for Nelson off his fingertips well covered by breadcrumbs six and the field goal kicking unit comes out for the Packers he had exactly what he wanted to oneonone with Jordy Nelson Aaron Rodgers will take that every time Jordy Nelson goes to jump I think if he keeps running he's got that ball Maison Crosby will attempt a 30yard field goal for 13 remaining the kick is right through the Dolphins leave is cut support points a good Drive led by Aaron Rodgers but he wanted more only 87 yards for the miami offense in the first half but they woke up at halftime it's been the run through the air with Ryan Tannehill who's caught fire and they have responded right now a head of the Green Bay Packers 24 to 20 you see if this Packers defense can respond Miami has gotten the ball three times in the second half and scored touchdowns every time on long drives as Mason Crosby from the 20 immediately following game two nationally championship series on Fox Sports live charissa Thompson is in Seattle an exclusive oneonone with the star of the biggest game of the week Dallas ins and Seattle who will have a bus we've got plenty of baseball sorry champ cake cap will have instant reaction from the Giants Cardinals game to looking at three of the American League Championship Series in Kansas City leading that it's all coming up after NLCS Game two only on Fox Sports 1 sports go there the Dolphins down ahead looking to put it up and Pat it down play Matthews I like what Dom Capers did right here yes you have your back up corners in but you got to trust him you got a pressure up Ryan Tannehill that was effective in the first half play Matthew so good at that if you're not going to get there get your hands up very skilled at it big play for the Packers second and ten for the Dolphins the running back three wide receivers light with a nice little cut in the first down the rookie from LSU secondround draft pick having a good day see the eyes of Ryan Tannehill hits Jarvis Landry in stride Andrew got isolated against a Jayhawk in the middle that matchup tilts to the favor of the Miami Dolphins Landry five catches 71 yards including a touchdown trying to work this clock day my daddy was leading the way Joel plotz got an update Joel hi Sam you guys got quite a ballgame there quite a ball game in Cincinnati after a 97 yard kick returned by Adam Jones set up Jeremy hill for the three yard touchdown dance and a little icky shuffle 3130 extra point ensuing Sam and John what a game in Cincinnati a great game here where the Packers started off Domon and a tremendous effort here in the second half of the Miami Dolphins it really has been Ryan Tannehill has been outstanding in the second half and if you're the Green Bay Packers use some of your bigtime players she got Julius Peppers clay Matthew they got to step up right now and I think if you're Dom Capers your two starting corners are hurt because you got to trust the guys that are in there you got to put some pressure on Tannehill time's running out for the Dolphins they have only one timeout remaining and if Miami can get a couple of first downs maybe they get out and run out the clock and then you know I think this Green Bay defense is a little tired weak the time of position time of possession was so far in favor of the Packers at half that has been flipped in the second half on the plane to fly eggs come in Brad Jones fought his way over a block and was able to take down Ryan Tannehill anything go use the hands answer the face there it is you see that left hand at Brad Jones it's really a good rush they brought that pressure we were talking about but hands to the face clearly hands to the face of Lamar Miller the running back who picked him up on that blitz and nether first down Miami Dolphins just short of the 35 now the Packers were given back a timeout in that injury the Sam shields it was ruled that the injury the clock was stopped because of entry before the timeout was awarded to the bathroom so they still have one timeout remaining Lamar Miller short gain as he crosses the 35 yard line the Miami Dolphins in possession with the fourpoint lead trying to keep that ball this is where they want to keep the ball away from Aaron Rodgers don't let him back on the field that would be a good thought and I you know the one thing if you really wanted to be bold if you're Joe Philbin bill Lay's or the offensive coordinator Dom Capers going to be loading up the box to stop this run if you took a shot to mike mike wallace you'd have that oneonone outside would be very bold but it might be worth the shot with the backup corners in there for the Green Bay Packers there's Aaron Rodgers who saw his lead to evaporate and the injured cornerback Sam Shields number 37 come on Williams number 38 out of the game with injury huge losses to starting quarterbacks for the Packers one of the replacement house and we welcome you to South Florissant rosandjohn Lynch Pam Oliver dolphins right antenna hell throws it away she is being chased out of the pocket on a second down play this has been quite a game the Packers on the opening drive of the game went 80 yards for a touchdown took the lead had the lead into the second half but the Dolphins have had a tremendous run here in the second half with three possessions of three touchdowns and right now the Dolphins with a 24 to 20 lead and a third and nine as they try to maintain possession and keep the ball away Rogers the Packers are out of timeouts said Dom Capers gonna dial up the pressure on this big third dime and keep it on the ground there's notes on Marino so the Dolphins go for the short run maintain possession don't take your chance and now we'll punt it away I understand you want to tick have that clock tick but the other side is you've got Aaron Rodgers on the other side who's going to get this ball with plenty of time only up four points this is good football game Sam it's been something special you know you see the numbers for mr. clutch Aaron Rodgers is playing in his 100th NFL game mica hide his back teeth the Dolphins are huddled up along the sideline and they've called the timeout now here's what's happening on the second at Jarvis Landry they bring me allout blitz Tannehill starts to get hot Randall Cobb with Aaron Rodgers extending the play the ones been working in the second half Ryan Tannehill has been outstanding in the second half after a real rough first half really being able to come back through a couple of pics in the first half and really is bounce back a bit tremendous in the second half 19 4:30 in the game Ryan Tannehill Aaron Rodgers 18 for 32 Aaron Rodgers has never won a game here in Florida oh and three in his career Brandon fields the part of the way alone out there some pressure but he got it away Micah Hyde takes it smoothes gets to the 40yard line good returned by my god 41 yard punt 17 yard return coming up next it's America's game of the week how about this one Dallas in Seattle Tony Romo Russell Wilson Dallas 4 and 1 Seattle 3 &amp; 1 pretty good everyone heck of a game I know this you're gonna beat Seattle you've got to be able to run the football put a little chill on that rush silence that home crowd DeMarco Murray's doing it as well as anybody in this league he's got way more carries at any 130 carries this season's that should be something special in the second game of our Fox NFL doubleheader King to National League Championship Series here we go Rogers at the forty no timeouts twominute warning starts to run again they hand it to starts he cuts it back nice gain in the Dolphins territory is a twominute warning with a minute 57 to go and the Packers trailing 24 to 20 this has been one tough game here in Miami Green Bay getting the early lead the Dolphins coming back strong and now the Dolphins with a fourpoint lead with under two minutes remaining and the Packers in dolphins territory what do you look for here John well I think Green Bay's got to be able to protect Aaron Rodgers Cameron Wake only has one sack but he's been all over Aaron Rodgers he got it helped that right tackle a little chip from the back tight in giving a little chip something to protect Rogers and allow him to get the ball downfield everybody out Rogers gets time bitch away from burden trucks it off to James Starks short pickup but he gets out of bounds to stop the clock bounds of the 47 it got the time very impressive as Miami defense has been all over these receivers and really stayed in this game so tough to do because Aaron has an ability to extend the place but they've remained steadfast in their coverage impressive effort by this Miami defense in the yard on the last play second and nine factors are out of time she sends everyone on step shop well covered he tried to get into Andrew Carlos that tight in but well covered by Philip wheeler so here comes third down for the Packers Aaron Rodgers gets some time they give a little chip on Cameron wig bhaktir it holds up but cannot get down the ball downfield Watchers has been sacked twice in the game once by Cameron wait everyone out bronzers in trouble Catherine wait get Olivier Vernon get to Aaron Rodgers to take him down unbelievable hustle play by TJ laying the right guard and fall on this ball does this ball is out Rodgers again nothing downfield watch the ball out but watch T tailing games over if he doesn't hustle this at least gives them a shot on fourth down they have to get to the 38 for a first down the Dolphins due to time out what are your thoughts there John they didn't have the right guys on the field now I think Kevin Coyle Joe Phillip Minh you got to have it right but that's not when you want to call a timeout Green Bay was struggling fourth down fourth down and ten to get the right play in but the Dolphins obviously didn't have the right personnel some miscommunication they got the timeout and I tell you this defense has been incredible early in the game Green Bay just owned the time of possession they stayed with it they kept the game close ten three at half and in the second half we're seeing Aaron Rodgers having time but now no one downfield they're really guys well there's been I think that's from the most impressive thing that the downfield coverage by the Dolphins has been outstanding I think Kevin Cole has been really good a good mix of some mantoman pressure no pressure he's keeping Aaron Rodgers as good as he is off balance but all the great Bay Packers you saw the winning streak eight straight wins in October 14 of their last 15 games played in October they've won but that's in jeopardy is the Dolphins who are really trying to believe in themselves I think they have a look believe this would raise it that they can make the playoffs in this AFC ease he talked about in the open joke Tobin said this is a great measuring stick I think they've measured out very well there it is Rogers next time he throws he factory dancing and Nelson stepped out of bounds at the 30 yard line but it's a first down for the Packers how about that unbelievable Jordy Nelson brick Ryan's been doing such a good job but Aaron Rogers gets pressure right up in his face gonna back up and make a laser throw down the field heat in his face he just can't do it any better and Aaron Rodgers shows while he's regarded as the elite of the elite an 18yard picked up on a warrant and now the everybody else here they come Rogers King tournament James starts Jimmy Wilson the safety with the hoods around the corner almost got to Aaron Rodgers Kevin Coyle the defensive coordinator continuing to do a nice job fourman rush here comes the pressure Aaron Rodgers has to flush but Jimmy Wilson the nickel cornerback makes and threw it a little earlier than he wants it puts it on James Starks but he can't quite bring it in second and 10 of the 30yard line the three seconds remaining Nelson that time couldn't hold on Nelson as nine catches in the game Sam I think it's really interesting you've got tired players on both sides you can see it these guys are huffing and puffing who can keep that concentration Jimmy Johnson just to say fatigue makes cowards of us all who can withstand that fatigue and make the plays to win this game Nelson has been targeted 16 times time this season he's had Rogers being rushed get rid of it James Starks he's got the first down and now it's hurry up time with a clock running got to have the touchdown Rogers is calling him plays not striking the football everybody else outside the Kent's gate but the continue to run the 10k random job now that the 15 now you got to get the spike to at least give yourself an opportunity to get to that end zone Rogers not here here come's despite the despite he claims he's pulled out of the bounds at the 4 yard line how about that in the home of Dan Marino he pulls the Marino he had me I told you the spike was coming he fakes it Davante Adams the rookie all alone and takes it all the way to the 5 yard line look at him get small in there Annmarie toes in the house six seconds remaining first and goal for the Packers now the Dolphins use another timeout and that is their final timeout right down to the final second what a ballgame and you know what both teams are saying thank you Lord for that timeout because they are tired coming up after our game on the state farm game break Curt Terry Howie Michael Jimmy we'll have all the scores all the highlights from around the league they get you ready for America's game of a week Dallas at Seattle's and this has been quite a day we'll see the Packers again next week in Green Bay home against Carolina Carolina fought their way back in Cincinnati but now trailing 34 31 to the Bengals late in that game now here's the challenge you're Kevin Coyle the defensive coordinator Joe Philbin how do you defense Aaron Rodgers here I think you got to bring pressure you know and that leaves a oneonone but you're going to have to rely on those corners you've got to put pressure force it to get out of his hand otherwise he's so adept and extending the play and it's hard to cover for that long down there so I think you got to bring the pressure in your quarterbacks have to stand up and with Aaron Rodgers he can go any different ways Davante Adams has had a big game Randle causes reliable and of course is Jordy Nelson beeping they're tied in a lot to help protect with that's one less receiver that can get out just inside the 5yard line six seconds remaining impression they pick it up three seconds left monitors in tanjur the cup Corliss has been staying in most of this game help it out with the pass rushers Mike McCarthy makes an adjustment he wants that favorable matchup he gets it against the linebacker Phillip wheeler and Aaron Rodgers doesn't hesitate on the money to Corliss who brings it in 11 plays 60 yards they gave Aaron Rodgers a chance they got the ball back and look at that the quarterback in the coach Wow the lead 27 to 24 with 3 seconds left you know you have to feeling like Miami couldn't have done anything else they played it him about as well as you can play them here's the matchup poreless on the white linebacker we learned look at that ball I mean you can't throw it any better and Corliss just concentrates brings it in and that Aaron Rodgers is such an outstanding player the big moments he drives three touchdown passes in the game for Aaron Rodgers ten in the last three games and 15 for the season and call us with his second and there's that fake spike play you looked at dan Marino the dolphins in Dan Marino's house I don't know if that's legal but they worked he may have looked up for dead since you think this is the time to use it I'll tell you what though Aaron Rodgers Mike McCarthy outstanding effort and I think gives you the Miami Dolphins there's there's no such thing as that this is moral victories now but they played their tails off today they gave it everything they had and if you're looking at this as a measuring stick I think they should feel good about themselves moving forward there's positives for sure to take out of this game the second half of dissolve ins playing offensively was terrific and defensively up until that last Drive they said they've done some good things made some big plays in the first half especially so now Mason Crosby kicks it off the ball is taken by the Dolphins they take a knee they want one play you know Sam I go back that drive never happens if within that drive there was the fumble for Aaron Rodgers TJ Lang hustled his tail off to get on that Paul or that drive never happened the little things that you Aaron Rodgers gets all the credit TJ Clegg may have saved this game for the Green Bay Packers there it is the fumble watch TJ Len come out of nowhere it looks like the Dolphins are gonna find it TJ Lange comes in they live to see another down and Aaron Rodgers should give him more opportunities he's gonna make you pay from the 26 yard line the last play of the game the buttons got a penalty Tannehill rolling short Jarvis Landry shuffles it back Brian Hartline close it back to the quarterback Tannehill and so that's gonna do it Patrick the game is over in a while there's a wild finish and the Green Bay Packers defeats of Miami Dolphins 27",

  "transcript": "getting ready for football in warm South Florida let's find out how warm it is on the field here's Pam Oliver well Sam the Dolphins were hoping that this weather would play a big factor in this game impacting the visitors but the Packers may have caught a break we've got us to cloudy skies and a bit of a breeze making the temperatures here in Miami bearable Mike McCarthy had a plane coming in and he's going to stick to it he was going to rotate his running backs wide receivers just have to throw up a hands if they need a breather linebacker Clay Matthews he also told me that the front seven will also be in a heavy rotation Tim it is hot down here so I'll give me don't get me wrong now but it is not a dry heat Thank You Pam Sam the greatest thing talking to Mike McCarthy yesterday we were talking about those rotations he said I'll tell you one thing I'm not rotating my quarterback smart man sir Branton and crowd is alive the won the coin toss elected to defer and Kaitlyn Sturgis ticks it off and this one goes through the end zone for a touchback to the Wanda Harris and the Packers will start from the 20 and here comes the man we're talking about 100 NFL game with 200 touchdown passes for Aaron Rodgers and the thing that impresses me most and I think everybody that watches this man play the 53 interceptions all right there's a lot of guys who've thrown 200 touchdown passes but the way he protects the ball while also pushing it down the field unparalleled last two games seven touchdown passes no interceptions in fact he hasn't thrown an interception in his last four games starting in the shotgun everyone outlaws his quick outside Vivante Adam slips a man and it's out of bounds up at the 25yard line to pick up a five on the flight check out the Packers offensively the yards aren't there but the points are there really stats will really fool you when you're looking at the Green Bay Packers because what they do they score points and they hold their opponents down last time I checked that's the name of this big ship we maintain off the play fake the Crescent to pixel Adams again first down after the 43 yard line quick straight to the rookie Davante Adams this is a guy you can see it happening before our eyes the trust is starting to be there for Aaron Rodgers in the rookie from Fresno Davante Adams he's had got with a lot of skill Aaron Rodgers likes them he's starting to trust him more and that's paying off for the Green Bay Packers and catches coming in including his first NFL touchdown catching two quick ones already this afternoon a gain of 18 on that last play and the first one of the game Eddie Lacy with a short pickup and the dolphin wrong back led by Kalani Jenkins who's starting at middle linebacker today you look at these Miami Gulf it's a good defense it's hard sledding against them but they got some guys back and strength up the middle is so important Randy starts have him back after missing the game at the tackle Konishi at the linebacker and Rashad Jones at the safety position back from a fourgame suspension their second and nine the fake again Jordan option with his first cat could step on and against close to a first down Jordy Nelson is one of those guys you know you have to account for minor move against the proper respect well I think you make a really good point this guy's leading the NFL in both receptions and yards and here's why it's the yards after the catch he's also so explosive people don't give him enough credit for his speed in the better start and he lays he on first down straight ahead Dolphins strong in the middle play was whistled down Jelani Jenkins leading the defense of charge for the Dolphins we talked about that strength of the middle what Starks hold up on that doubleteam here comes Jay Lonnie Jenkins Rashad Jones just the guys were speaking of they feel very good Joe Philbin I thought made a great point really good defenses are strong up the middle they've got that back in those three guys wait up ready ready again LaCie this time tries to go outside hauled down by Olivia Vernon the defensive end did a nice job fighting off the block Olivier Vernon does a great job of doing what you want to make any lacy dude go sideline to sideline you don't want him going north and south because he gets to that second level and safeties are making business decisions good against the run passing situation they spread the offense glacis in the swath of the life Rogers runs without a permit he may've gotten enough with that last little lunge to get a first down Rashad Jones on the tackle I want you to look at this that's what Aaron Rodgers saw no one in the middle he's athletic enough to take about it but the football above the net he checked to that he saw the middle wide open you're going to give him that he'll take it all day long aaron rodgers needed 8.8 first down factories at the dolphin's 37 Rogers looks around inside the ten that's a beautiful mix for the Packers it really is they're starting to spread the football which we've seen the Packers do so well Kopp tremendous at that route right there the corner route and Aaron Rodgers so accurate name 28 on the play first and goal at the 9 yard line Packers have been outstanding in the red zone this season scoring 13 touchdowns and 18 Prince halation touchdown Tony Joseph Wow you talk about precision and Becker's parts down well Mike McCarthy you're talking about the respect as Jordy Nelson get it and he said I don't think he does all the time and a big part of that it is Eddie Lacy the dolphin saw Eddie Lacy run for 113 yards last week versus Minnesota they respect the one that leaves Jordy Nelson wide open and when you leave guys wide open Aaron Rodgers will expose you 13th touchdown pass thrown by Aaron Rodgers number 5 of the season caught by Jordy Nelson they said Crosby for the extra point try as Aaron Rodgers makes a breather and the Packers with an outstanding start to vacation Aaron Rodgers leading the way and Jordy Nelson on the receiving end of the touchdown pass today's game is sponsored by Southwest Airlines without a heart it's just a machine now you watch play action and what it does to safeties they got quarters coverage right here on Jordy Nelson with shot jones remember out for four games good player but you've been out for a while he just forgot about Jordy Nelson he left his buddy Brent Grimes out there but that's what happens when you get a running game going people have to respect the run these Jordy Nelson wide open second time this season Packers have had an opening drive for a touchdown first one was against the Bears the idea is to stay cool on the sidelines Sun comes out and it's strong Mason cross he kicks it off and on the return is Jarvis Landry cross we get a piece great return my tournaments library land training gives the Dolphins great field position today's game is sponsored by Bud Light who reminds fans to stay in the game and greet responsibly take a look at this kickoff return Jarvis Landry didn't have to do much he had a gaping hole endorsee right here just brought up from the practice but he's got to stay outside he's got to contain that football landry saw a big gap and just took it tremendous job by Mason Crosby saving the touchdown 54 yards on the return for Jarvis Landry has had a couple of good ones that a 74yard return earlier this season and a 40yard return and there is the man that his third year as quarterback to the Miami Dolphins Ryan Tannehill and as you said this is an important game for him a good test for him yeah you want to you want to become a better quarterback you want to increase your standing in this league go ahead beat an Aaron Rodgers what a great opportunity for him he knows that they got to play to their strengths and it his strengths in my mind playaction passing got to get that run game going to start from the pack bring brightness seekers right it goes luck to the man at the back and goes out of bounds and around the 40yard line one thing the Miami Dolphins do very well is run the football they spread you out and they run it right up the middle and you see Green Bay they struggled mightily early in the year against run they've been proved too late it's gonna be an interesting matchup to watch Knowshon Moreno ready to play he got it hurt in the second game of the season that we had a huge opening day of 134 yards off a tackle and he's got a first down stole a page had a Baron Rodgers bahahaha and this is something I think they need to do with Ryan Tannehill he plays better when they allow him to use his athleticism he's reading play Matthews on the edge right there Clay Matthews crashes down he's going to keep it use that athleticism a former college wide receiver first down dolphins backers have struggled on Wendy since the season Miller basta 35 Micah high and on the tackle and of three four Lamar Miller Sam I think a lot of those struggles on run defense they're playing really a different style of defense they're going heavy with the linebackers no more BJ Raji Ryan pic of the big three hundredplus pound guys in the middle more in a trading of late I've seen them play better run defense they're starting to find their run fits in this defense second and seven girls play the tightend rock shifting to the right side Tannehill big fancy prose and it's incomplete big my goodness peppers man that guy hit you yeah I know it for anyone who thinks Julius Peppers his little long a tooth has lost his game just watch him last week incredible interception return but this is what he does best gets after quarterbacks and the Packers do it very well under Dom Capers their great defensive coordinator and bring up a third and seven shows peppers very impressive numbers sacks and interceptions he's quite an athlete very good shift from the for this year deep into plate over through beyond sins the tightend now the sidelines of a dolphin stall but the field goal kicking unit comes out caleb sturgis will be trying a long field goal his seasonlong 51 yards in pregame warmups he was trying it from the other side of the 50 yard line 65 yarder he made in pregame warmups this this one would be 53 yards John Denny the long snapper the holger's fields and we've got flags up front Joe Philbin the head coach of the Dolphins of former assistant coach with the Packers and there is Mike McCarthy the headband of the Packers long discussion bill vinovich is our referee today is sixth year as a referee ninth year as an NFL official neutral zone infraction so forth now this was in pregame warmups that was a 65yard attempt it had the distance so they moved it up it still fourth and three and this one will now be a 48yard try and it's on the way Sturgess with the strong leg of 40yard field goal the Dolphins get three on the board now they have to find a way to stop Aaron Rodgers and the Packers offense today's game on Fox is sponsored by your next truck Ford f150 by Burger King for a limited time get 10 chicken nuggets for just $1 49 and by Geico 15 minutes could save you 15% or more on car insurance thank you with us in South Florida for the NFL on Fox and Rogers awaiting a return to the field after a good opening drive and the Dolphins despite good field position had to settle for three points and against a lot of people three points is good enough it's the Green Bay Packers Aaron Rodgers as well as he's playing you gotta score touchdowns another strong picks like Caleb Sturges from the Packers we'll start with a twenty saw Rodgers come out of the gate firing release so quick and then the touchdown to Jordy Nelson who's just been phenomenal Packers really clicking on that first drive interesting dynamic between Aaron Rodgers and head coach Mike McCarthy the head coach wants to run the football and Aaron Rodgers wants to throw the football well Aaron Rodgers last week pointed out that first down they haven't been good enough and we said how do you fix they said that's easy be more aggressive deep throat we talked to Michael to run it better so we'll see who wins out game starts in it running back fish and carries her grand appease got an update let's go to the studio that Lane Kurt all right we're ready burst out with an injury third I've got he'll win it getting the opportunity to show he can do it he says wall here 21 yards to set you down to the 9 yard line two plays later he would score and they leave Minnesota 7 nothing Sam John a pan all right Thank You Kurt Williams bounce back from a tough one backers that's their dolphins took to run against girl Mitchell was the first him it's just really good defense you watch up top Cameron wake at the end of the line of scrimmage he's going to set that aids saying you're not getting outside and then Earl Mitchell fighting off the block extending getting off the block and being stout up front really good we don't Rogers gets time and completes it to the Monty Adams who spins for first down wanted a rookie from Fresno State who led the nation and receptions last year looking good well the rookie just schooled the veteran because Cortland Finnegan your help is inside instead he gets his eyes off the receiver and instead on Aaron Rodgers and Davante Adams puts a nice inandout move bottom and Aaron Rodgers so accurate deliver at 6 for 6 to start the game Jane starts forced outside force defense up front like the Dolphins Jelani Jenkins leading away he's had a strong start to this game he's a guy that I really like he has stood out watch him shoot the gap in iteration kills run games James Starks has to go sideline to sideline and here comes the posi to clean it up it's where the Dolphins are very good they penetrate extremely well and they run to the football they play hard on defense loss of three on that play and he lates he back in for the Packers of running back Rogers again gets time that we moved out and he slides down at the 31yard line that's just good coverage down the field Aaron Rodgers buys himself time he does what he does best extends the play but no one's open Brent Grimes to plan some zone great job by Jenkins by the Miami Dolphins stuffing even Aaron Rodgers that was one of the Dolphins biggest fears about letting Watchers extend place they speck them in the pocket they think he's even tougher outside his third and he loved it but sure this time Catherine wait pass rush man for the Dolphins gets there to sack Aaron Rodgers Cameron wig going to come off the edge and Brian Belaga Kevin Coyle the defensive coordinator told me before the game he put on the film from two years ago Cameron wake beat new Galaga for two and a half sacks on that day he did it to fire Cameron wig though it looks like it worked out it did his first sack since opening game for Cameron wake the Packers forced to punt Tim mast a they kicked it away Jonathan greenie first crew blocks Kevin bass days you just have to make place he comes through Latimore's block of that left hand and really unimpeded to mass tank it's just a great one win by Freeney and puts the Dolphins in tremendous field position see if they can cash in first down at the 16 second career block on 10 maste Knowshon Moreno back in the lineup quick outside to Mike Wallace and no gain on the play well coverage Sam shields right in on Mike Wallace and that's what you have to do against the Miami Dolphins what Sam shields just did they're gonna throw a lot of balls behind the line of scrimmage candy come up and tackle they're gonna spread you out wide Sam shields does it beautifully right there no huddle offense here Laughlin's get to the line no submarine on his first carry since the second game of the season and a great opening 134 yards against the Patriots then got hurt on this first carry in Game two and you like the way the Green Bay Packers defenses responded sudden change to mark of good defenses you're going to get some adversity how are you going to respond thus far they've done it well hurry up offense again third and seven Tannehill chut to fix the lens ring he's got a first down that's the for you hooked up there Tannehill the line of dreams what's it with rookie receivers school a longtime veteran quarterbacks today the rookies plan mix up a couple Latroy guy on on the stop this is where Moreno really comes in handy he's a power runner he breaks tackles Lamar Miller more of the speed demon been really good in his absence but this is where Knowshon Moreno shines how about the dolphin changing the pace here you gotta like it you haven't seen know how to play on the lot this year trying to create a little tempo a little energy moreno again but he stopped good work inside again by the troika of those temple talked about no more BJ Raji no more Ryan Pinkett but here's the guy they brought in died on and he started to make plays last couple weeks he's been a big part of the resurgence and on defense third and goal from the one big play in the end zone by the Vaughn house gets away with one right bought house to his hands he knows to be there in Rogers you have to score touchdowns there's and it can't get back penetration by the factors led by the safety Morgan all you safeties you make big plays down there great answer by the Green Bay defense well Morgan Burnett makes this play the watch Latroy guy on shoot the gap and that really makes this play great call by Dom Capers putting more than they can handle guy on shoots the gap Burnett comes in here comes the the posse to me that's a play Ryan Tannehill you got to check out him they've got more than you can possibly handle means oneonones outside great call by Dom Capers but if you're Tannehill check to a better play don't know if he has that freedom Vince if you need to in that situation very French stand by the Packers who maintained a seven three lady Joe Philbin that could spot on the play big cocoon and Olivier Vernon on the tackle of the big fullback tonight on Fox Sports 1 game 2 of the National League Championship Series Giants with a big win wat great pitching by Madison Baumgardner I mean that was fantastic last night Jake Peavy and Lance Lynn the matchup tonight in st. Louis has been just outstanding baseball across the four games going on Sports Tonight following football Coon again big power back ready to pull the pile well even in Miami you hear the COO to the city and they love this guy and here's why because he plays with tremendous determination you think he's down not so fast gets a little help from TJ Lang pushing the pop DJ said I'll help you out John don't worry here's third and less than a yard anyway she it's lazy and he pushes the pilot for a first down for the Packers and through parlous a tight end with a big block his time winds down in this first quarter backers now a little fluid of maneuver I felt that the run game started to get going last week we've got come to the end of the first quarter here in South Florida great start to the game for Aaron Rodgers and the Packers lead seven to three Sam rosandjohn Lynch Pam Oliver here in South Florida Ryan Tannehill would like to be like Aaron Rodgers he studied him in the offseason Aaron Rodgers excellent start in the Packers five point three yards offensively pert a play and defensively holding the Dolphins the 2.484 much like they came into this game they football was in it from a fence and defense pushed down King starts in the backfield the play fake Rodgers rolls looking deep buddy open again good job of coverage by the dopplers when the Dolphins really stressed this this week they know that not only Aaron Rodgers but this entire receiving Corps does such a great job and Aaron Rodgers says it's not by happenstance in practice he intentionally even in past skeleton when there's no defensive linemen there he'll scramble so that they can get used to where they should be and where he expects them to be but Miami knows that and doing a nice job Aaron Rodgers having fun playing football you gotta love that so Finnegan Wilson and Grimes actually oneonone covered their lances ran for six at second and four Rogers with time that was thrown a little behind time for a game break here's Curt Menefee after going to sports wall against last week and I'm still I would say that Gina Smith off the hot start today his touchdown today some all part of the six to seven start and the Jets beat Denver seven three at home Sam Jonathan the Jets want to get back in the AFC East grace they've got to win that game today what no one expects that Peyton Manning so hot last week but they doing a nice job keeping him in check there's third and the Packers their queen again Watchers rose first down at the 34yard line just a tremendous job a little traffic by Jordy Nelson and then the chemistry that Aaron Rodgers has with Randall Cobb he's gonna back straight on it's almost indefensible Jane starts at a good block picking up the Blitz to help Aaron out and Rogers 7/4 894 yards watches again with time throws low this time one of the connect with Rory Nelson but missed Sam you mentioned just before the quarter ended that Green Bay lastly put to really be getting that running and going and that's where they become so difficult to defend because if they have Eddie Lacy and Starks running the football world well then George Nelson and Randle file but now Davante Adams can be it's a real tough pick your poison type situation for the defense when they have that run going factors to their no hugging and Rogers directing traffic empty backfield on second down play clock was coming down to zero and Aaron saw it uses a timeout backers with a 73 lead here in South Florida the two head coaches they know each other very well they sure do enjoy Philbin knows Aaron Rodgers very well I'm sure he spent a lot of time in that defensive meeting room everybody's got their kryptonite I just haven't found it yet with Aaron Rodgers about what it is impressive with Gilfillan said he processes information quicker than anyone else starts the running back backers with a second and ten at the 35 yard line was tried and that shovel pass is incomplete Cameron wake again strolls around the edge and this is a defense we're calling it double a gap pressure that pressure right there what that does creates a oneonone for this guy Ryan bulaga working against Cameron way quick is winning that how do you create that oneonone you show the pressure inside they have to account for it you can't double them that look we're seeing it around the leg and that's why you can do so many things but one of the great things you can you you could single up your best pass rusher in ten 20 bucks rhymes closing quickly on Jordy Nelson and the Dolphins defense comes up with a big series you give that third down to Cameron wake because that influences Mike McCarthy's Mike McCarthy's play call he knows he can't hold on to the ball what do they do they get rid of it quickly and Grimes right there on the spot back to punt and Mustaine last time suffered a blocked punt second of his career creamy gun in there this time maste gets it away lands around the 30 and bounces out of bounds at the 26 yard line Green Bay defense has been strong in this game on a couple of short beers today's game on Fox is sponsored by Chevrolet find new roads by KFC the world's best chicken how to you KFC and by Lowe's clothes never stop improving annual screening saves lives help finish the fight against breast cancer by visiting nfl.com slash pink to celebrate the NFL and American Cancer Society's firstever a crucial catch day on October 25th several players have family who have been battling breast cancer somewhat been survivors some there currently but something very important in the NFL about Noah on first down show back you still on this back at the 17yard line it turns into a loss of 10 as haha written dicks made the tackle the words of Kenny Rogers you got to know when to fold them this would be a good time Lamarr don't go backwards trying to make something out of nothing sometimes you just got to take your losses instead it puts their offense in a very unfavorable position how about the Green Bay defense they're coming on aren't they really are then very impressed last couple weeks I think they're starting to understand what Dom Capers wants from them and it's working out really well on second down planta tight end but walk down immediately by the young safety haha Clinton dicks and I think haha Clinton dicks as you look at the eyes of Ryan Tannehill he's a big reason that they're playing better they haven't had a presence at the safety position since Charles Woodson Levin since Inc Collins had to retire because of his neck injury they've got a safety presence right now in haha Quentin Dixon Morgan Burnett at 11:25 yards on offense third pressure Atena help Peter they say hey chaching down on the Packers eight interception of the season that ties them with the Giants for the NFL lead just a tremendous job by Casey Heyward he's just reading the eyes of Ryan Tannehill who liked it most young quarterbacks will stare down their receivers see the good pressure by Perry but just staring locking in on that on that target and Hayward reading those eyes comes out of the flag goes and gets the football outstanding play by Casey Heyward I'm very impressed with this Green Bay defense as a defensive back for you looking at the quarterbacks eyes all the time absolutely particularly a young guy because what they're gonna do they're gonna lock in Ryan Tannehill does it there that's all Heyward did his responsibility was the flat but he sees those eyes easy pit right there so the Packers have the short field first down at the miami 36 yard line Safin AC hayward gives a Packer fan obviously someone he must be related to wearing the hayward jersey Eddie Lacy on bites hard for three yards down to the 33 Cameron wait leading the charge talked about the Packers defense eight interceptions already this season they had 11 all of last season and that will help your office you see them scoring so many points offensively a large part of the head is that their defense is giving the ball in great situations they're not cooling and lacy in the backfield Rogers checking at the lines what's coming its Rogers completely nelson and he's got a first down at the 20yard line Brent Protestants the coverage on Nelson or the subtleties I want you to watch Eddie Lacy watch this blitz pick up step up meet Rashad Jones that gives enough time Taran Rogers and Jordy Nelson one on one that favors the Green Bay Packers every time spotted at the 19 yard line lacy in the backfield along with John cone first down Packers backers scored on the opening drive any man in an 80 yard touchdown drive right nigga you hear the fan reaction time for an update let's go to joel clad in la Joel alright say let's go to Cincinnati the Bengals trying to bounce back after that embarrassing loss to New England last week Giovanni Bernard is gonna help out 89 yards longest scoring run in the NFL this season against that stingy Panthers D bangles up 147 Sam and John we will see Carolina next week in Green Bay Mike McCarthy Eddie Lacy gonna like that guy some chinks in that brings to see that big we do second and six it's Lacey and led by Jimmy Wilson the safety and Randy Starks who missed the game in London helping out on the tackles Randy Starks that he is very stout in the middle just going to create traffic in there Jimmy Wilson will stop the edge they're really doing a nice job with Eddie Lacy but I credit Mike McCarthy keep running it keep him honest there that provides the oneonone matchups outside yeah they're not gaining all that much on the ground 33 yards rushing third and seven Rogers together the Olivia sighs this time wait this fineman's Vernon where bakhtiari the left tackle is saying he's offsides instead I think it's just a real good jump watch it up there who wouldn't by Olivier Vernon it just beats him off the snap and Bakhtiari had no chance is that a guest by Vernon on the road remember silent count reading the head of the center just an outstanding pickup probably studying a lot of film and what Aaron Rodgers need to do now is bury that snap count Mason Crosby attempting a 43yard field goal over ten maste and the kick into the right through the interception it's the Dolphins turn that play strong defense and hold the Packers to three points it's ten three Green Bay though the tricks of the trade Olivier Vernon what's he watchin he watchin that size 12 of Aaron Rodgers the foot gets raised puts it down and off to the races Olivier Vernon that's the thing that film study gets for you sure they've watched Aaron Rodgers on the road Olivia in Vernon steals the staff a sack off his film study Packers have had the ball 16 minutes 26 seconds dolphins only 5 minutes 26 seconds it's a bad deal when Aaron Rodgers is the quarterback you want him on the sidelines Miami's got to possess the ball they need a big drive here Mason Crosby to kick it off there's Jarvis Landry back DP at a 54yard returned earlier line drive they want to make it hard on land her attorney picks it up he was trucked up they bloody by Nick Terry otherwise Jarvis Landry might have been gone good return again by Jarvis Landry as the Dolphins go on offense down 10 today's game is sponsored by pizza it's bacon and cheese stuffed crust we're back in South Florida with a Packers leading the Dolphins ten to three dolphins have had only 25 yards total offense the defense rests line tad Hill sparks from the 32 yard line notes on the right and ready back off the play fake Tannehill and it's broken up with a heart ha ha Clinton takes on Mike Wallace ham all over and down on the field what's happening down there Pam hey there Sam the Packers they took a little extra precaution to guard players from the heat they actually toted their own awnings to this game from Green Bay I noticed they're only put over the offensive players the defensive players on the other ends they have these cooling benches so they're good to go but they brought their own honors I think you can get under their family here's Moreno going outside gets up close to the 34yard some things never changed off it's they get to get awnings we get the cooled seats I mean that unbelievable I don't want you to look at this score 35 to nothing in the second quarter Baltimore is leading the Buccaneers in Tampa Bay yikes yeah I believe that hasn't gone the way people thought people thought they were a playoff team this year possibly with Lovie Smith feminine on 30 days comes up short Nick Perry got a piece of impairing made a big tackle on the kickoff return makes a good play here the trip up Ryan Tannehill well Ryan Tannehill tried to take the page out of Aaron Rodgers but he saw that green in the middle they checked to the quarterback draw but Perry makes his second shoestring tackle gets the on the kickoff return he had one and then he trips up Tannehill shored up the line to gain now the Dolphins who are that have the fewest three and outs in the lead get a three and out right here good job by the Green Bay defense again Brandon fields kicks it away Micah Hyde on the return departing some blocks but he found the little opening and turned nothing into her turn across the 40yard line Micah Hyde and everything going right for the Packers 24 yard return well the Green Bay Packers are head in this game but it's not because of the play of the Miami defense they are all over air Rogers they're stopping Eddie Lacy they can continue to win those oneonones outside the Packers got to have an answer I think they've got to get this run game going with Eddie Lacy because they're gonna struggle to protect Aaron Rodgers those are two good pass rushers in Wake and Olivier Vernon Vernon excuse me good like a you so much I forgot his last eight legends bo bo la vieille all day long but they are struggling to protect right now and they've got to get those tackles some help Miami defense keeping the Dolphins in the game right now the way out of place the question is the time of possession are they going to get worn out Cameron wait you saw on the sidelines the Dolphins rotate the defense packers start from the 40yard line after the outstanding but return and let the hide and he lacy the running back the play fake extended the play and turned it into a three yard gain on a the run slid down hard in some fun comfortably but Mike McCarthy he's the head coach he's also the play caller you're struggling to protect what do you do you max protect you keep a couple more guys in and that gives Aaron Rodgers that was well covered but that did and a fold on more than 20 and Huntington real late flag thrown but maybe that's why the coverage was so good Portland's head was hanging on we said that a few times to leave the coverage out Hills been good for Singh Rogers to take the ball and take off on his own absolutely first down for the Packers at the 48 yard line the Dolphins can't believe any the backers of freebies later five threes like any many foster lacing the corner one Ferretti lacy on first down into dolphins territory down to the 43 yard line konishi made the tackle now you're starting to see the ingame adjustments by Mike McCarthy we saw the protection now we're seeing the inside runnings not working so what do you do you go outside and Eddie Lacy find some green grass Mike McCarthy very very accomplished at adjusting to what the defense is giving them that's Cameron wait number 91 back in at the fence of n second and one for the Packers it's lacy blinds bow amici finally wrap them up so much of this game you could talk about skill but it really is the will and Eddie Lacy on his way to becoming really one of the premier backs in this thing that's all will that's flight he's obviously blessed with some incredible strength and ability but that's just will by Eddie Lacy trying to get himself going and carrying the Miami Dolphins for a first down first down at the Miami 40yard line James starts in at running back all the launchers in trouble get women and say and they're supplied for attention Rogers work ducking his tension price offense number 12 Baba well sit down take it down yes man wake was standing right in front of the one he looked up really good fundamental football bye Cameron wait you got to run the run away instead stay on your job which is getting up field Aaron Rodgers clearly in the pocket nobody out there nice job by Bill vinovich but Cameron Wake sometimes that's what you do to a great passer you try not to block some thinking he's gonna chase the run but he's on his assignment fall back to the Green Bay 47 yard line you have to get to the Miami 34 first starts the runningback second and 23 relates to Jordy Nelson Smithfield brought down my Jelani chickens immediately following game 2 of the National League Championship Series on Fox Sports live for asset Thompson is in Seattle where the loose one with the star of the big and Dallas old and baseball as well we've got coverage with gabe kapler to the Giants and Cardinals Rogers Randall table like Cameron wait right after he released their Rodgers questioning bill benefits the referee about the hit and once again Miami defense with a strong series they're standing up again it's just their office needs to sustain a drive because they've been on the field too much as the Miami Dolphins D but they certainly are doing their part of the equation to master the punt it gets rid of it high kick Jarvis Landry and takes it on the run at about the 15yard line Cameron wait he's been trying to get to the quarterback there was that hit that Aaron Rodgers didn't like that can understand why backers trying to stay cool on their side of the field have a 10 free lead dolphins will start at the 16 yard line they've got a little help on the offensive line Mike bouncy who was the starting center was out he's back in he's playing guard with Samson Satele e playing well at center yeah and it really was an effort Joe Philbin said just to get the five best players on the field Pouncy played guard in college talking to him on the field before the game he said really that's my position it's where I feel most comfortable it's not working right now though Green Bay defense doing a tremendous job stopping the one for these dolphins we saw the dolphins came in running the football really well but Dom Capers the defensive coordinator for the Packard's is saying you're gonna have to be too strong on the football Tannehill hasn't been able to do that as of yet on that offensive line for the Dolphins is number 67 Darrin College a former Green Bay Packers he's from North Pole Alaska yes there is a North Pole Alaska that he went to North Pole Alaska high school then went to the Green Bay Packers out of college the Boise State dolphins from the sixteen with two running backs in Damian Williams rookie out of Oklahoma and Lamar Miller is Miller thing gets a couple of yards on the play we go down to the field to Pam Oliver with saying we're watching something down here we're waiting on information on dolphins long snapper John Denny the Dolphins medical staff has been working feverishly on as any focusing on his left by heavily tape no backup long snapper snapper rather is said for in the Dolphins line back with Jason true snake at one point I was snapping the ball we'll keep you updated we believe that he will return back to you thanks Ben on second a day trying to tighten breaks one tackle gets a first down close the 30yard line ha ha Clinton Dix on the stop 14yard pickup ville laser the firstyear offensive coordinator for the Miami Dolphins told us in meetings I've got to do a better job of getting Charles clay in both of the game he's too quick and too fast we see these mismatches and tight in all over the league he does it with speed this Charles clay laser wants to get him involved does a nice job of it there Tannehill steps up going deep ii picked of the day for the Green Bay Packers Sam shields does a tremendous job gettin up hi pointing the football let's see if he brings it through the process of going to the ground looks to me like we have a catch looks good to me too I agree with you John well the Dolphins took the shot deep downfield Decker's had it well cover they did it was predetermined that that ball should not be thrown shields had the position Hart line did not he predetermined before the snap he's thrown that football you can't do that at this league guys like Sam shields will make you Penn he went to the you that he did he's back here in the Miami area makes a big play second tens of the name for Green Bay they now have nine interceptions the giant stone plate until tonight Green Bay leads the league in interceptions they are on a turnover role right now ten in the last four weeks just planned great football tref rebuild vinovich checking the sidelines it's like we're ready for play backers start from the 32 yard line Mart line is neck being checked by the medical staff off the paint and the throw is checked at the line might have been Jared odd trick made the plate quick update show find what's happening sale escopeta Buffalo where Kyle Orton has led the bills back to tie it up against New England remember Tom Brady 22 and two alltime against Buffalo but this one's all tied up a 7 Sam John for a good race in the AFC East thanks Joel Kyle Orton doing a good job stepping into the starting quarterback role and on 2nd and 10 complete Jordy Nelson's short gain up to the 37 yard line Brent Grimes covering give him 5 on the play and we've got the twominute warning Green Bay Packers with a 10 free lead on the Miami Dolphins follow your favorite team all season long go to iTunes comm slash NFL lotta Packer fans made the trip to this game they travel well they sure do you can always see them to that cheesehead stands out in your own stadium there's third and four for the Packer to a for Freight in the James starts the warming box Rogers with time first down Packers and the 45yard line louis Delmas on the coverage Monday Adams with his fourth catch of the game but Davante Adams really coming up big they're gonna tilt the safety torts Jordy Nelson side so that means Davante Adams has the oneonone keep talking about trust but early this year Aaron Rodgers did not trust the rookie receiver that Trust is growing with a tight and Andrew Wallace and into dolphin's territory see Aaron Rodgers arm talent that is just unbelievable Starks is in your face what do you do you come three quarters and boy can he spin the football it comes out so quick it's just it's fun to watch this guy play football and some toss second and three pressure coming and overthrows Jordy Nelson who is well covered on the play by Frank Rimes time of possession is becoming really onesided John it really is I think it's a problem for this deepness we talked about before that last drive the Miami office they needed to sustain a drive what they do three plays another interception this defense for the Dolphins is playing really good defense how long can you do it though they've been out there so much over 20 minutes Falcon 8:25 shifting Nelson down watches intercepted by Rashad Jones intended for Andrew Wallace the tight end to it moved outside these are the opportunities when you're playing against a guy like Aaron Rodgers you have to cash in for shot Jones right through his hands you're playing against the great ones we used to say it when we played against Brett Favre he's going to throw you some you better catch him Aaron Rodgers doesn't throw you many so you better when he does Rashad Jones first game of the season coming back from suspension Jarvis Landry is back deep the Dawson's defense comes through an old blast they just got that one away to touch that let's check in with Curt Menefee Curt coming up on the visa hot tub got all your early highlights including Peyton Manning off to a slow start for the Broncos against the Jets and don't back off to a crazy hot start in Tampa Bay it all comes your way as we get started when we come back baby step outside I always want to know where Terri is already in this area so must be a makeup buffet line jarred push the special teams ace doing his best to get those feet reestablished not quite all right dude the Dolphins here we've got a minute 30 seconds honey POTUS I think you go to score you're gonna have to score to win this game Mike Wallace off his hands and complaints Ryan Tannehill just five for 12 40 yards in this first half dolphins have only 49 yards total offense and when you're struggling like that offensively Mike Wallace has to make that catch they play him a lot of money to come in here and make plays you got a young quarterback struggling how do you lift them you make plays that ball should be caught poor receivers in actually play the attendance in the squat Tannehill and steps out of bounds just across the 30 its of course down for the dolphins like a hide coverage on the play on Mike Wallace his second year with the dolphins and the coach is telling us yes Friday that he's much more comfortable in the offense this year I think this offense is a tremendous fit for Mike Wallace they have him very much remember bill laser the coordinator came from the Philadelphia Eagles and Chip Kelly they have him very much in that DeSean Jackson Percy Harvin we're moving them all over the family I think really utilizing his skills well with a good grab a pickup of 19 on the play Ryan Tannehill when he does it right he looks the part the net ball he's quickly released on the money to Landry I like a couple of things here Sam first of all the trust in Tannehill he's thrown two picks very easy just to go to halftime say hey 10 3 were happy with that but Tannehill keeping the confidence in himself bucks tomorrow heroes villains Colin in the new drama everyone's talking about even you John that the gossips it's the story of the city to transform the boy into a legend catch a new episode tomorrow at 8:00 7:00 central right here on Fox I have not watched Gotham yet I will this week but I hear great things about it you need to sit down watch a few episodes hey do it do it at midfield the Dolphins with 47 seconds remaining and two timeouts remaining right Tannehill and over at Rawls Mike Wallace he was open but good pressure that time from the Packers I like that from Dom Capers a young quarterback starting to established a with little rhythm what do you do you bring pressure right in his face a Jayhawk taking the duty there and an errant throw from Tannehill second and ten for the Dolphins at midfield and shields covering on the playoff records event two interceptions here in the first half Mike Neil here ran out of Purdue and the backup that outside linebacker comes in and made the hit on Tannehill and there's a big big man an important man on the old line Brandon Talbert to luck tackle is hurt on the play that's a double whammy you take the sack that makes it awful tough to score with only 35 seconds but you also get your left tackle hurt on the play due to the injury inside 2 minutes as the second charge timeout Miami 30second timeout and the good sign is Brandon Albert is up and walking off under his own power though limping there's Albert he's gonna work against Neil who gets the sack looks like that the chip he tries to get some help from Knowshon Moreno and Knowshon Moreno got the wrong guy he got his own guy and that one stung Brandon Albert named free agent signing for the Lambie dolphins in the offseason normally were the Kansas City Chiefs Sammy's really played well that would be a big loss at left tackle it's played well they're gonna ship Chauhan James the right tackle over to left tackle and who is if he comes in at right tackle just like that most women second year man out of Tennessee is in it right tackle JaJuan James the rookie out of Tennessee goes to left tackle Dallas Thomas has been starting at right guard in the last four games to get to the Green Bay 44 push down swing pass to it cranks free and gets out of balloons is out of bounds at the 42 yard line short of a first down good effort by Charles clay and a great effort by Julius Peppers 13th year in the league really starting to show his impact but this one just hustled down the field peppers continues to chase the ball and he's the guy who gets clay short of the line to gain there's John Denny and Pam had reported earlier a medical staff has been checking out his left thigh wrapped it up he was injured on the last play and here in South Florida we're seeing defense probably had its best both defenses playing very very well they really are Aaron Rodgers came out hot and it looked like",

  "transcript": "we get set for the Packers and the Vikings here in Minneapolis south of campus of the University of Minnesota on a 48 degree afternoon pretty comfortable down there huh goose Oh Kenny not bad at all you know Kenny when I look at this game Aaron Rodgers he's been on fire the last two weeks it's got nine touchdowns zero interceptions 656 yards I mean it's unbelievable he asked yourself lied what's the reason I know the reason it's Eddie Lacy in that run game something that this team has not had in a long time I got a chance to talk to Aaron door warmups he told me that the run game has allowed him to be so much more aggressive downfield and you don't want that supposed trouble for any defense in the NFL bye thanks juice Mike McCarthy's Packers one two straight six of their last seven they put up 55 points off Chicago and then 53 against the Eagles last week Mike Zimmer in his first season as Vikings head coach longtime defensive coordinator with Dallas Atlanta and Cincinnati the Vikings won the toss elected to Firth so Blair Walsh get things started the want Harris said Mike to hide back deep for the Packers you know Kenny you talked about the weather one thing it's a noon game and the lights are on in this stadium they give you a little bit idea of what the weather's like a little gray down here a little bit of fog but great conditions for both of these teams so the actors who lead the entire league averaging 33 points per game offense flatout off to the field by the quarterback Aaron Rodgers and I agree with what Tony talked about with Aaron Rodgers in him being aggressive because of the running game the defense has to respect what they can do with Eddie Lacy but that's not going to change his approach he says were aggressive down the field any lacy behind me but never gonna stray too far juice first down duksoo is out to the 29yard line gain of nine on first out as we take a look at this highflying Green Bay offense and a lot of it has to do with those guys up front the starting five able to stay together the majority of the year Brian belaga misses week two but that's it Jordy Nelson and Aaron Rodgers have developed the chemistry that's virtually impossible to defend from defenses she picks up the first down out to the 32 my team's defense ranked 31st a year ago terribly number 12 they're doing a nice job up front and they're not getting a lot of credit but one person that does respect them is Aaron Rodgers he understood that the last time they played earlier this season it was 28 nothing at half but that got away from right at the end of the half with some turnovers they forced renounce than that first half against the Packers to replay today we receivership off the ventilation games for out to the 36 and just another one of the things that you have to guard against when you play Aaron Rodgers you can have a great coverage scheme and everybody's picked up on the back end and he extends the play he gets to the outside this is a well done job by the Minnesota Vikings right here because that's when Aaron Rodgers is at his most dangerous he's broken contained he's out on the right side looking to throw the ball downfield he had a couple of 16 yard rugs Sunday they just won now to the 37 yard line setting up third down and five and I think with Aaron Rodgers out of the lineup last year at the productivity of Eddie Lacy during that time in the running game that people may have thought hey Green Bay is going to become a more balanced offense that notion early on this season and they use him as a changeup bellefleur's defenses to account for him and that's why could exploit the secondary climbing down third and five for the Packers cybertek complete intended for Devante that's two examples during the course of this opening series for the Packers where the Minnesota defense was forced to extend their coverage quite a long time and they did a good job of class receivers you see everybody is going to be covered Aaron Rodgers is trying to go for that back shoulder furrow felt there was a little bit of contact at the top of that round in the last four games Daryl coming into this one factors it costed only three times the first half 21 yard line a return of five 47yard punt by keeps on offense when we come back rookie out of Louisville makes his seven start biking start from the 21 jintae dance Jerick McKinnon is the running back after missing six teams games 23 yards out to the 44 and that's another obstacle that this offense has had to overcome because they haven't been able to have Kyle Rudolph in the lineup and he's going to be a good friend to a young quarterback on that tight end spot you can see he's still not 100% as he's running after the catch suffering that sports hernia earlier this year I'll tell you what is a huge target though running across the middle of that field at six foot six goose all he gets 11 reception of the season first Gary for McKinnon three H a hawk the tackle when you're a young offense in transition the one thing you don't have is a very large margin for error so we can't have penalties you can't have drop balls you can't have the mental mistakes negative runs to put you behind the chains and that's going to be critical for this offense today for the Minnesota Vikings they've got to stay on schedule so they don't get behind and allow that Packer defense to bring pressure the 30th ranked offense to the NFL second out of seven belted in at fullback the fake to the in the vicinity of the former Africa Johnson Green Bay ranked 25th defensively and I think there's a lot of talk about what this Green Bay offense is doing but it's really a complimentary style of team football this defense has been outstanding the addition of Julius Peppers paired with Clay Matthews you know bringing in Latroy guy on that this is a group that has really improved this year they're taking the ball away getting it back in the hands of that explosive offense and scoring touchdowns on the great touchdowns the last two games for the Green Bay defense so they are second in the league in takeaways burg out at seven vikings must get to the packers thirtysix that pass intended for Johnson and rich Warner cooking in Pine Kings whole punch it away that's a nice job by teddy bridgewater standing in the pocket and making the throw but he's got to have the connection here because this is gonna pop open on the opposite side we're gonna get all the way to that back side and Charles Johnson is gonna be open right there look at how wide open he is in that situation you've got to make that throw in catchy Partington Randall Cobb save yard line so each deep with what possession one first out back to Minneapolis second possession for the Packers they start from their 17 yard line all us the tight end that field to the right of Rogers we found the whole betting Lacey picks up a first down out to the 29 a gate of 12 is really kind of what this offense forces you to do with the emergence of Eddie Lacy in the running game it's kind of a simple box count you look right here you've got yourself and well that's what we want you've got a guy hanging back there but he's leaving that front and that's what Green Bay is going to take advantage of if you're going to show on that Aaron Rodgers had a lot of flexibility at the line of scrimmage to get into the correct light right card TJ Lange injured on the play he and Josh sitting really been toughing it out the last couple weeks with some nagging injuries and we talked about how important having those starting five together has been and hope that TJ lying is just down here for one or two plays so while the Packers medical staff chaps with lag we head to Los Angeles for a game break Curt Menefee Curt all right it's hard to beat this for a quick touchdown opening kickoff in Philadelphia Josh 107 yards score for the Eagles the 10 touchdown they'd head by unit other than their offense this year and they're just starting their 11th game they're up seven up and right now against Tennessee Kenny Michigan Wow so you had another return touchdown for Philadelphia as Lang exits will be replaced by Lane Taylor you talked about the continuity Darrel the starting five have been together for nine of the ten games coming into this one down 10 and 11 but earlier the first corner from the 29 on first down it's laziness to cut it back inside and James a couple out to the 31 Robert Blanton nothing up for these strong safety spot to make the tackle there one thing that defensive line for Minnesota has done a really good job is keeping their shoulders square on the line of scrimmage not turning Eddie Lacy's reading them up on that line of scrimmage Susan sees his shoulder turn he's gonna cut right back but with a nice job of going and being a little bit patient on that defense Ron check it down at 8:00 by the staff it's a false start O'Brien Bulaga wasn't because you didn't hear the count it's been pretty quiet here in the stadium I think it's gonna be one of the fun things during the process of the game is what happens at the line of scrimmage urn Rodgers has the ability to get into the play and change protection but Minnesota and Mike Zimmer style of defense they'll change their blitz schemes they'll change their twist based on what the quarterback says so we'll have to see how much control Aaron tries to cover up at that line check it out in 13 following the penalty his passes cloth take it out to the 37 yard line by the rookie out of Fresno State who led the nation in receptions last year Davante Adams and he gains 11 very slow getting up now jog and off to the side he's back he's still there but he's definitely not a hundred percent right now now he's that heat towards the sidelines but remains of the game it is lacy and a lacy picks up the Packers first out out to the 40 one of the things that people talked about last week with the Packers was getting out of balance run pass you can see this week it's six rushes two three passes it's really based on what the defense is doing Philadelphia was going to allow them to throw the football that's the way they started that game Mike McCarthy is not worried about balance within the game he's worried about scoring points this is intended for Jordy Nelson Xavier Rhodes on the coverage second intent coming up for the factors on their second possession of the game it's a little bit of that same philosophy that we've heard ship Kelley talked about you know sometimes we want to look at a game and how it was played and look at how many runs and how many passes and a lot of these coaches now it's about points we love the fact that we can do both successfully but it's all dependent on what the defense is doing we're going to attack them with our best options Laci on second down now to midfield so what the Minnesota Vikings are doing right now is they're dropping two safeties back deep to protect themselves against this explode explosive passing game so now Aaron Rodgers out the line of scrimmage even in that long yardage situations just handing the ball off to Eddie Lacy that's their matchup in that style of coverage to get on the coverage Packers wanted a flag Xavier Rhodes is playing really well right here at the start of the game tight coverage on several occasions we've seen look at that step for step head around working back with Jordy Nelson to the ball and good pressure up front by that Minnesota defensive line they kind of collapsed that packet pocket and force that throw out a little quick now a decision for Mike McCarthy on 4th and short and he will send out the punting unit with the play clock winding down second putt here in the first quarter passed a lets it go down inside the 10 the factors putt for the second time but they in the Vikings deep scoreless sea in Minneapolis they way through the first quarter second possession for the Vikings ten yard line this is the kidding by Josh boy Vikings trying to get some open formations to get a favorable count there to get this running game going it'll be interesting to see how long it takes before the Packers really just start to commit that extra defender into the box to get a +1 situation to shut that running game down really forced a bridgewater to win this game throwing the football for a first down out to the 23 yard line it's the tight end chase for this nice job by Teddy Bridgewater because he's looking to his left initially and then he's going to come back to the right and find chase for coming out of that three tight end bunch good quick throw yeah those linebackers been on that early and looking left first attack from the 2320 i catered out to the 27yard line data for there's been tape brought in by the Vikings earlier this week after his release by the Cleveland Browns a very very nice move by the Minnesota Vikings Matt Asiata is out today still not recovered from that concussion last week so a little thin they're very fortunate to have the opportunity to grab a guy like Ben Tate at this point in the season did not get seen Greg Jennings on the field team is it uniform has his helmet on the former Packer bothered by a rib injury this week under pressure they froze away took it from Morgan Burnett this thing collapses on teddy bridgewater very quickly you like to see young quarterbacks with the ability to step up but you can see right there there's nowhere to go he's got a peel and then get out the back does a nice job of getting outside no he did not get outside the pocket huh they threw the grounding flag right there brings up if he gets outside of that tackle box and gets it beyond the line of scrimmage he can avoid that penalty but it was close though you need one or two more steps it would have been would have been there and this is the situation we talked about no negative plays in a small margin for error just something as simple of that the inability to get that ball thrown its just incomplete not even a completion but just getting it thrown cleanly incomplete so you don't have the penalty lost of 16 on the intentional grounding Jennings on the field the slot Johnson split wide to the right that is third down and now the Vikings will putz it away for the second time and they're gonna bring it back a little bit that elbow was down for Jerick McKinnon but again there's nothing wrong with this right here you know you have the penalty they put you in a bad situation but to be able to come in and have the clean punt and you see the elbow down right there the left elbow down so the runner is down at that point but now it's up to your punt coverage team you've got to get down there and again keep this Packer offense this explosive packer offense on his long a field as possible like a hide return to punt for a touchdown last week against Philadelphia and hide with a nice return out across the 45 so good field position for Aaron Rodgers and the Packers following the 54 yard punt 17 yard return you breaking news the Packers have punted on their first two possessions they start from the 46 TJ Lange back at it right guard James starts in the backfield for the first time today this is starts outside truce at the end of the play hackers recover back in the 14th it's amazing how everybody attacks the ball once you're stood up it's trouble time right now and looks like that looks like he still had possession when his knee was down but again let's just go back to that last series by Green Bay they had that decision on the fourth and less than one out near midfield again this is the complementary style of football that they're playing an explosive offense but a much improved defense this season with the addition of Julius Peppers they get the ball back right around that same area with a fresh set of downs because of their defense and also for as watches with the quick release vibes Nelson but just Robinson right there to make the tackle time for a game break curtain well here's something we haven't seen in quite a while Matt Ryan in the Falcons 24yard touchdown they beat Cleveland seven nothing that's Julio's first touchdown since week three any Muhsin goose first place at foreign six if the plans for started today Atlanta would host seven and three green gotta fix that playoff system third down and ten rajesh steps up down at the 25yard line a 29yard pass play on third and 10 a Packers first down well Mike Zimmer knew they were going to have to play tight coverage today and they've done a nice job captain Marlin there he's going to be underneath look at the throw by Aaron Rodgers I mean it just spoton perfect spot for that truck down in the slot for up the 25yard line and off to Lacey lady caves a couple down to the 23 top Johnson makes the tackle and you have to understand this this offense is functioning so well right now that you can do everything right and they're still gonna make a play look at the coverage look at the window that Aaron Rodgers fits that ball into that's that's like I said before with a majority with him it Randall Cobb now sometimes it's just indefensible he sees mother and that muttering never get his head back around wreck about a fake Laci it's the tight end Wallace stays on his feet first down more Andrew promised to the Minnesota seven yeah Mike Zimmer talked to us about two things we've got to play tight coverage and we've got to tackle well they they struggled with her tackling against Chicago last week there's Anthony bar again you've got to wrap up all the way down to the legs you too high you started to tackle up around the shoulders backers lead the league in first quarter points from the seven off the faith delay see watches work again so he throws now to the intended receiver Harrison Smith defending pass interference defense number 22 first down Green Bay you can see right there and again a credit to Aaron Rodgers and his escape ability he extended that play and Harrison Smith has no option but to grab a hold because Jordy Nelson's got a beat going back to the inside backers now said did and three tight ends call from the one Lacey to the top for a great babe touchdown I just think this the back and forth here at the beginning of a game of this game is what Mike McCarthy likes to see his guys do with complimentary football not panicking we expect you know you know fireworks when the Green Bay Packers offense is out there Minnesota's defense is doing a nice job and they forced them to punt but they just play that complementary style eventually you're going to make a mistake we're going to bottle you up and your own in we're gonna get the ball near midfield because of the punt return or special teams and then we're going to make you pay for basic Crosby the extra point Eddie Lacy with six rushing touchdowns this season three of the six against the Vikings Packers have scored 108 points over their last two games against Chicago and Philadelphia only the 15 in NFL history at least 50 in backtoback games it's been impressive to watch and a lot of those points coming in the first half I mean just explosive out of the gates and you've got a guard against that against this Packer team right now they did not score on their opening possession for the first time in six games but 78 Patterson on the return out to the 27 it was a nice Evan flow for the first couple of series back and forth and then on that last series Green Bay really get puts together a nice drive to get the touchdown now Teddy Bridgewater and his group they have to come out they have to respond again you have to have points no but you can't come out here and do a three now you can't put the Packers back on the field right away you've got to have some productivity with your offense on this series Bridgewater missed the previous game against the Packers with actual entry it was Christian Potter's only started this season Matt Cassel started the first three games for fracturing his left foot seven start for prints water his pass is it's headed for Jarius right and opportunities for place to be made we had Gerald Charles Johnson with one early the game Jarius right on the top of the screen good push gets a separation that's open it's an easy throw catch and we're just not doing it and it's the growing pains of a young offense learning a new system pushing there by the vaad house man he's got to go and hug up a little bit called yard cushions not going to work gain of five so we'll be third down at five for the Vikings as we approach what better remaining in this first quarter and again this kind of shows you we've talked about the explosive capabilities as Green Bay offense but they can get into this brine de toute style you see the time of possession in favor of them but spent a lot of Eddie Lacy today some short passes offensively go back here now the backfield third down and five there's better steps up and takes off he picks up a first down and slides down at the 42 so Bridgewater on 3rd and 5 Hamilton he 11 and that's a good recognition of the coverage that Green Bay's playing he is going to understand that we've got mayic coverage is gonna be backs turned to me as soon as he gets to the outside he sees the open field and takes it right away no hesitation no trying to feather that ball in to anybody Vikings do not have to run a flight as time lines down in this first quarter here in Minneapolis a oneyard touchdown run by any lacy accounting for the only scoring to this point so after one it's the patches over the Vikings 7fe yes it is the first Vikings Packers game in Minnesota outdoors since November of 81 turns out to assembly who set a doubts for the Vikings Bridgewater it's off the hands of Johnson in that last outdoor game between these clubs in the state of Minnesota Darrell Packers won 35:23 big day for James Lofton Ahmad Rashad with a 50 yard touchdown reception for the Vikings does that make the older some very familiar with those 33 years ago there are heroes Packers defense at five interception to that James as well feel it is Jovan iord that is his first career carry second year back out of Texas El Paso and I tell you right now what's impressive with these running backs for the Minnesota Vikings they're having it completes on first down and they're coming back to the run on second down and they're still staying in good positions this is third and two that got the third and four so they're being very effective on that second intense situation running the ball the sidelines and he picks up a first out Minnesota without Matt Asiata today and of course Adrienne Feder said it was announced earlier this week suspended for the remainder of the season and his appeal hearing has been set for it except for the second yeah and it's been a big challenge because at the beginning of the season you know Here I am thinking Adrian Peterson in a North Turner offensive system of the numbers are going to be spectacular because I think he gets a lot of credit for his passing game but you have to go back remember the running backs that have been in north turner systems five rushing champions in that office fires have Johnson unable to make the catch he's throwing good balls they're just not catching those will stop there man those your suitors need to help bridgewater out a little bit yeah just a little bit of everything right now on the boss thrown on target we're not getting the completion or we're just a little bit off target on some of the throws and we're not making the difficult catch but it hasn't been clean right now in the passing game so tight coverage bite Ramon Williams right there bridgewater just two of eight to start this game second of ten Ellison but a Jayhawk right there to break it up the tight end coming right across in the middle of the field a Jayhawk with the tight coverage there and that pockets starting to collapse a little bit you love to have a goto guy in this situation as an offense and right now nobody's really kind of asserted themselves on the outside at the tight end position as somebody that teddy bridgewater can go to in a critical situation in points in the game down in check steps out there is a fun which water tackled at the 30 died about five yards shy of the marker by Casey Heyward like McCarthy trying to figure out whether to accept the penalty considering where the fuel position could be whether the Vikings would try and go for it on 4th if he declined it illegal shift offense two men were moving it didn't get reset prior to slam that penalties declined brings up fourth down so it's fourth and five from the 39 and now bite shimmer will because offense on the field and that's what Green Bay forces you to do you're in this position right now you're kind of in noman's land here very very long field goals it gives you the ball back at the spot of the kick if you miss it this offense so explosive you don't want to turn it back over to can you execute that punt in without losing a huge net by kicking it into the end zone Vikings must get to the 34 for a first down Fortin far picked off by Morgan Burnett basically the same as a punt but we'll check in with bleep lakeman so he's gonna be holding on defense guys they've got triple coverage on cordarrelle Patterson so no reason to hold in that situation he was bracketed three ways inside/outside over the top prior to the pass holding defense it's early in this round right here Darrell despite a high 33 grabs hold of cordarrelle Patterson you're exactly right you have double coverage help overthetop no reason to go and try and slow him down yeah even if you got beat on the release you got on top you just let him go because you had safety help over the top so the Vikings elect to go for it on fourth and five throw off flag I'm tired to try for Minnesota for up to 34 a king tackled from behind by Julius Peppers boy he's really blossoming in this defense you know it's interesting to hear you know guy at this stage of his career very excited because people are finally starting to use me the way I always want it to be and it's successful as Julius Peppers has been you'd be like whoa what what does that mean I mean a standup outside linebacker in a threefour as opposed to that for three defensive end he just eaves loving all the different things that defensive coordinator Dom Capers is doing with which Warner to the outside another hi was caught by Jennings so the folder Packer Craig Jennings those up and brings it down games nine well done by Greg Jennings on the outside watch this it's a high ball he goes up and gets it as it's a timed well bite Ramon Williams right there to make the contact so good job with the concentration and then the strong hands at the point of the catch Jennings has scored two touchdowns for the Packers in Super Bowl 45 her down and walk throws the passes off the bark he was looking for the tight end Ellison so now another fourth down for Minnesota this would be a 43yard attempt but it looks like Mike Zimmer will leave his offense on the field wants to get on fourth down I take some points and get some positive emotion some positive feeling with my offerings right now I'd check it out right now and picks up the first down so zipper candles and wins as the Vikings again better to set it down that's some penetration inside the Green Bay Packers are going to get them a little bit of a push right here but it's just a good job by the running back actually Josh Boyd from the defensive tackle spot beats inside jerk McKinnon does a good job of bouncing that out one more hole get the yardage for the first down yeah you had a defensive tackle and a Jayhawk going the same gap there was one void that's exactly the kid found and got that first down the kid had over 500 yards on the ground this season second among rookies he's replaced by paddy bursted kid from the Green Bay 22 Johnson the police right there Chauhan Williams I don't know if he thought that he had helped from behind but he was very casual with his coverage at the beginning and a good throw catch Charles Johnson and Teddy Bridgewater for the touchdown loss the extra point Johnson holding on to the footballs his first touchdown and it comes against the team that drafted him last year in the seventh round the Green Bay Packers a stadium under construction here in Minneapolis at the site of the old Metrodome the project is 23 percent complete over 600 workers on site daily there it is scheduled to open in 2016 and then in February of 2018 Super Bowl 52 here in Minneapolis I want a beautiful what a beautiful facility that is going to be when it's completed not just the same old stadium completely different so host the Final Four in 2019 Bridgewater the Charles Johnson don't be at the new stadium in two years tied at 7 to Minneapolis Packers pumped it on their first two possessions Darrell for the first time since week 1 against Seattle and you can see the pressure they put Arne you're putting them back at the 20 inside their 20 and then they have that defensive stand forced to punt get that ball out near midfield and then right down the field for that touchdown back his start from the twenty Raj his loads of time can't find anyone picks up the first down but I want to take a look at that slide that was a complete indecision right there tonight slide I don't know what I'm gonna do now next thing you know you're almost doing a somersault but it's one of the areas that I again you know his escape ability his ability to extend plays during the course of a game and then right there I mean last week he averaged 10 yards of carry when he decided to pull the ball down against the Philadelphia Eagles Jordy Nelson his second catch today is over 1,000 yards for the third time in the last four years yeah we've talked about Minnesota having to play tight coverage Xavier Rhodes is right there and look at the throw catch between Aaron Rodgers and Jordy Nelson the 47 the toss to lacy you know he has so much fun with the game it's part of it but this office yeah look at what they have done you know we've talked about it here and this is so impressive by this offense at the start of the game so credits of Minnesota's defense right now 19 touchdowns no interceptions in the first half and I think that's the throw off the Minnesota defense you know they're going to adjust to any mic designations or calls he's doing sir Rogers told us he goes sometimes I'm not going to do anything but I'm I can't really point at them to let them know what we're doing so I guess that that searching balancing thing is his new signal now the champ Packers just get the step reflects off the hand of the font eight atoms as we head to Los Angeles for a game break with Joel clad Joel by Kenny up to New England and the former hatred stealer now with the Patriots and Karen flood signed on Thursday into the end zone three r TD run Patriots up fourteen six skinny moose and goose Backshall the Packers keeping a close eye on that score three days tentacle 173 records the top the NFC North Takas must get to me Vikings 43 for a first down Rogers fires it was out of bounds that's how the left tackle David Bakhtiari we're going against Emerson Griffin who's had a great start to this year but on the sideline Jordy Nelson if not the best one of the best at his feet along the sideline you don't see that very often where Jordy Nelson finds himself out of balance on a catch now the Vikings looking to decline the penalty yeah it didn't make sense it would have been fourth down it was third and ninetytwo Blakeman initially announced that it will be a loss of yardage and a third day out but Mike Zimmer of course elects to decline the penalty so the Packers will putt for the third time in this first half Packers have more offensive touchdowns that punch this year well there was some concern from Aaron Rodgers he was one of the first people to say listen the last time we played him if you look at the score you thought it was an easy game but that game got away from Minnesota late in that first half they were playing well defensively against us up until those big turnovers at the end of the half Marcus Cheryl's back deep stay watching from his 38 yard line an affair Katz is called for at the 12 by Cheryl's you see we've been impressed by these guys 48 degrees 48 degrees you know you got a cheese head on that the one side and then you got the the Vikings guy you know you're just trying to impress each other they don't have enough meat on who skate what I've seen 48 first down we're in Kansas City last week for the Seahawks and the Chiefs it was 19 degrees it feels like summer today it really does you can't be pointing the finger out there the guys you know if it's if it's only 48 what are you doing with that long jacket on there chief I got my Spanx on I don't want to be no showed anything underneath there so I'm trying to look big I'm tending to skiing together currently I'm trying to look big dancharming ankle weights on second down at six she fries that is barely ticked off by Sam shields and here's one of the changes we've seen over the last couple weeks you want to get a bigger body inside it's clay matthews moved to the inside linebacker spot and then also the ability to rush from that spot and he gets the hit right as Teddy Bridgewater lets that ball go almost an interception for Sam shields so now third out and six for the Vikings they must get to the 22 for a first down in motion water steps up on 36 he dumps it off a great second effort right there great job by bandit he picks up a first down teddy bridgewater took another hit on this play you see a lot of young quarterbacks in the NFL looking to get out the back he's always looking to move forward takes the hit from Mike Daniels Joe banner that look at that one arm stabbed the catch secured and then the fight for the extra yardage to get the first down Church back in first and ten for up to twenty two off the faith to McKinnon rich waters who makes a spectacular play to come up with the interception for the Green Bay Packers his second of the season talk about throwing off the back foot all the time young guy exactly what he did Darryl cannot be throwing this ball by cahide with the pic his second in the last three games 19th consecutive game with a takeaway for the Packers Rogers had the Green Bay offense once again with terrific field position from the 47 yard line Lacey Lacey is finally forced out of bounds at the 30yard line well if this is holding on Jordy Nelson then I held on almost every snap in the NFL everyone because he doesn't get outside the framework of the body to me it looked like he was in tight and you were always allowed to get in tight in the framework and holding let's see if his arms get outside so he's got him locked maybe because he's on the shoulder right there if he was on the chest as opposed to being on the shoulder but that's when I blocked and I got inside on somebody and had then had the Jersey you know in the center of the chest area that's I mean you just walk them and you hold them and boy I guess I shouldn't get out up on that corner of the shoulder now all of a sudden it's a completely different thing following the penalty first down 4:47 Laci Rogers finds Cobb job picks up the first what a beautifully executed fake by Aaron Rodgers yeah and it holds Chad Greenway for just enough to get that ball to Randall comp so he has the ability to run after the catch just that little flash to Eddie Lacy Chad Greenway is a linebacker to the outside that you can see him who he didn't hand it off I got to get out there and get 18 now shifts into the backfield from the 35 is down just shy of the goal line just a nice play design to clear out and and report list is going to drop in to the spot vacated by the deep rod Jordy Nelson carries everybody deep it looks like he's going to go to the middle of the field Harrison Smith's got a long way to come did you see that slag saws lefty was down at the 34 yard reception longest of the season for Qualis first ago is forced to call a timeout with the play clock winding down five and a half to go second quarter in a seven seven game well all this week feast on the biggest rivalries in college football to getting on Thanksgiving Day is fifth ranked TCU battles Texas followed on Friday by over 13 hours out of state and number 15 Arizona then Saturday its Notre Dame taking on 19th ranked USC it all begins Thanksgiving day on Fox Sports one Fox and streaming live on Fox Sports go yeah speaking of college football here the home of the Golden Gophers facility impressive the reality man okay underneath got a chance to look around a little bit that the press box giant I mean the atmosphere is really you're missing that third level like in a post stadium with I like the horseshoe lady bolted up in 2009 Rogers end zone it's Richard Rogers there is a flag there is a tremendous example of something that head coach Mike Zimmer talked about when you have to defend Aaron Rodgers his vision is ridiculous now I know by design of the play there's a guy that's supposed to be going away from you this is just unbelievable that he is able to find richard rogers i mean he is wide open on the left side but just the vision under duress with players in his face it is so hard to throw across your body like that it's unbelievable if you think it's easy mousse i thought that suggests people out there go out in your backyard get a ball try and run one way and throw the completely opposite way so it's rogers rogers first NFL touchdown for the rookie thirdround pick out of town Aaron Rodgers all smiles 147 Green Bay short kicked off by crosby this is feel about the return Vikings Adam feelin out to the 37 with the Packers leading 147 bottling the touchdown pass from Aaron Rodgers to Richard Rodgers Rogers father also named Richard is the special teams coach for Carolina also played for cow like his son he touched the ball twice during the play Cal Stanford 1982 Stanford band on the field his dad involved in that play twice will he come up it's this by seven out to the 40yard line MacKinnon we check in with Joel clot lions and Patriots Joel yes sir Kenny let's head up to New England you know Randy Moss went up and interviewed Tom Brady earlier this week and Brady must be looking for number 81 it's Tim Wright second touchdown of the day it's 21 6 Patriots are absolutely handling Detroit kitty moose and goose all right thanks very much Joe here in Minneapolis under five minutes remaining second quarter doctor's waiting the Vikings 147 Bridgewater to McKinnon the tackle it'll be third down and three for Minnesota as good execution their jerk MacKinnon thehog route with Clay Matthews on the Blitz but in Green Bay just doing a great job with their pursuit they've got four guys rallying around to make that tackle led by a Jayhawk Vikings three four seven today on third down also converted a big fourth down on their story tribe to the outside its a first job for the tight end he definitely has boys in the pocket for a young quarterback Joe banger is going to pick up the Blitz bike Flay Matthews as he loops around so Rudolph games he loved it and the Vikings are in Green Bay territory with three and a half to play Packers capitalized on a Bridgewater interception Micah Hyde coming up at the pick backers with a sevenpoint lead inside Jerick McKinnon to the 44yard line eight of two second and eight having had the opportunity to play in this offense that Norv Turner is installing here in Minnesota you try to look for the pieces that were familiar on your team and he says you know it's a progression you know we really it's not about scheme and a lot of people will talk about that but it's about the players and as we go through this we've got to continue to add players into the play making spots we've got to find the goto guy and he kind of referenced you know go back to Green Bay last year was explosive as that team was when Rogers was out of the lineup that is not the same system so it's nuts to ski it's the players within the scheme and that's what Minnesota's looking to add first down is first perception today gain of ten and he could be a key player in this offense moving forward this is a young wide receiver you're talking about a guy over the last four years a junior college played one year at Tennessee last year his his rookie year he's more of an athlete right now than he is a wide receiver he's got to learn the nuances of the position and then be utilize that breakaway speed that he already has went to the pro ball last year as a returned man Bridgewater as we hit the twominute warning with the Vikings on the move trailing by seven here at Minneapolis NFL following the twominute warning we're at the packers leading 147 second down and two for Teddy Bridgewater the Vikings from the 26 of minnesota first down you're trying to balance the fact that you need to have points on this drive but y'all spoke funnily rockers a whole lot of time in this situation at the end of the first half they've played well here they had the one situation where they got backed up and had the punt in Green Bay took advantage of good field position they had Teddy Bridgewater get a little bit impatient on the last possession and throw an interception and they paid for that one but all in all that Minnesota has executed well here in the first half Bridgewater seven of his last ten and remember the Vikings will get the ball first the second puts on a couple of fakes event slides to the 16 yard line personal foul grabbing the facemask offense number 75 replay first time left tackle Matt Khalil we're gonna get your tiro and Elliot on the outside that makes that little move right there he gets off balance how you reach up and all of a sudden you find yourself with a handful of face masks look at the feet by teddy bridgewater there let's move on Sam shields the penalty force with the Vikings back to the 38 with a minute 12 on the clock first down 25 under pressure get rid of it and he's down 40 a loss of two trying to set up a screen and Matt Khalil just allows pressure to quickly from the left tackle spot right here this just allows Jim Rohn Elliot to get there too fast and it kind of throws off that timing you don't have anybody out there and credit Mike Daniels for recognizing that right away and getting into the throne room second down fires the taxes paid by Johnson 22 and now the Vikings will use their first timeout Charles Johnson drafted by Green Bay the season ago spent some time with dwarf Turner and Cleveland last year he as the Vikings touchdown today 26 seconds remaining in the half third down and eight for the Vikings for the Packers 21 we've talked about somebody for a teddy bridgewater to go to in tough situations looks like Charles Johnson could be establishing that wall he's out here on the top come on Williams getting a hand on it so now the Vikings with 21 seconds will send out the field goal unit the number of times here in the first half we've seen teddy bridgewater a little high on the throws Charles Johnson pushes it up timing off a little bit on that and this is a timing based offense there's landmarks there's their steps everything is kind of done in sync so the ball comes out on time so here's Blair Walsh this a 39 yard the Vikings get three at the end of the first half and Bolton within four and remember Mike Zimmer deferred at the start of the game so Minnesota will get the ball first following halftime now get up the PISA time report with Curt Terry Howie Michael and Jimmy happy birthday to both Michael Strahan and Troy Aikman who celebrated birthdays on Friday a bit of a different story for the Packers today than the last two weeks Darrell they led at the half over the Bears 40 to nothing and the Eagles 30 to 6 so you pointed out a good job by the Vikings offense there to get those points and also just to leave 16 seconds for Green Bay's offense here and again what they've been able to do here in the first half over the last two weeks you just mentioned what the score what the situation was at halftime the running game kind of disappears in the second half it's not viable at that point when you're down that far you've basically become onedimensional and now you've played to the strengths of the Green Bay Packer defense so the Vikings have done a really nice job here in the first half of keeping that run game viable for the start of the second half Aaron Rodgers died of 14 with a touchdown pass teddy bridgewater 11 of 22 1 touchdown one pick Rogers integrity Patras will take a four point lead into the locker room at halftime here in Minneapolis Green Bay led 7 nothing after one Macker by four time for the visa halftime report we send you to Los Angeles Curt Menefee taken away it's Richard Rogers back in Minneapolis Packers with a 1410 lead as we get set to start the third quarter today's excitement brought to you by Nissan Aaron Rodgers not a 142 the first half 127 yards and the touchdown pass to Richard Rodgers as we welcome you into the broadcast booth and Darrell after what we've seen from Packers the last two weeks the Vikings have to be pretty happy with the position of the road right now yeah not nearly as much excitement from Aaron Rodgers as we've seen in the previous two games so they've come out they've done that through the first half just the one hiccup by Teddy Bridgewater got a little bit impatient made the throw down the field that was intercepted they turn that into seven points so the margin of error again will be small in the second half continue to string these first downs together bump the ball cover it forced Green Bay to work on that long field as soon as they get a short field they really start quick we saw it on the punt return and we saw it on the interception first half numbers pretty even Vikings committing the one turnover you mentioned that it led to a Green Bay touchdown the decision byebye zipper at the start of the game to defer Mike's defense force bucks the first to prepay possession short kickoff it's taken by Chase for down to the 39 yard line so excellent field position for the Vikings their best of the day goose thanks Kenny caught the coach Zimmer about you know his first half performance he wasn't really happy with petty performance in the first half he says he needs to be more accurate he's a better quarterback than that we need to keep changing things up on defense and keep Aaron off balance like McCarthy also needs established to run in the second half the run is this secret to our success look for us to go and keep that ball on the ground and then get Aaron where he needs to be with those deep throws after we establish the run so that's what the both coaches said the suit happens thanks Chris we'll keep an eye on that rich water hands it off to McKenna on first down Canada's cross midfield into Packers territory there is a flag back at the 41 yard line Green Bay Packers losing contain coming into the inside getting out of your gap holding offense number 75 you're friendly that's Khalil again his second penalty of the day and he's had his struggles this season Darryl he's allowed a leak high 11 sacks yeah and right now it's just kind of mentally weighing on his mind and you know you got to get back to the technique that you showed your rookie year there was a lot of promise for Matt Khalil after his rookie season and for some reason here and this this season he's really really struggled firstround pick fourth overall back in 2012 out of USC first at 18 following the penalty which water under pressure he steps up away from peppers now throws and the catch is made by Jennings Greg Jennings out to the 43 yard line his second catch today he gains 12 well you know coaches number may be disappointed in his accuracy and he was a little high on some throws in the first half but I've been impressed with his poise he's looking for the deep ball they're looking looking he can't find it it's not open and he gets a check down to Greg Jennings I like the poise in the pocket by Teddy Bridgewater 7 Bridgewater hands it off to McKinnon out to the 45 Morgan Burnett the tackle it will be third down and four and you know you watch the college game today and you wonder how these young quarterbacks are gonna respond when they get to the NFL if they're in a traditional shotgun only system we see that the offense is looking to the sidelines for the information and North Turner told us he goes listen that that's college you can you bring those guys to the NFL and you have to start from a foundation what do they possess as a quarterback with all the things that we need as a thrower as a decision maker that's how you decide not based on the system that they have the pressure from Mike Daniels and this is one of the areas where you've seen it move up in the pocket you would expect Teddy Bridgewater to be a little bit more elusive in that situation to recognize it collapsing to get out of there to keep those feet clean so just some things that he's going to work on as he adjusts to the game at this level but north turner is impressed with a lot of the the critical things that you have to do from the quarterback spot with Teddy Bridgewater first sack of the game on either side Brad the season for Daniel's turns it down to the 13 hesitated short return now to the 17 Audie Cole the tackle on special teams Packers lead by four always something to do at the ball of America here in Minneapolis elected what the Packers offense was able to do in the first half over the last four games points per game of the first half versus today as lacy spins across the 25 games not on first out Harrison Schmitt to tackle the Vikings continuing to play it in a way where Aaron Rodgers will lean on the running game that's where the matchup is going to be they're taking away the passing game they're being conservative against this passing game with the positions of their safeties two deep safety looks second down and one plea receivership lacy picks up a first down out to the 29 yard line I'd like a little miscommunication between Aaron and lacy they're a little bit of an exchange problem almost there he comes out he opens up to his he's left when they ask the change to his right got it cleared up though multitalented man default first today to catch his Delson he was ruled out at the 36 so a gain of 6 for Jordy Nelson Xavier Rhodes got caught Washington it was such a good catch he's trying to figure out how he kept this off the turf let's see was Nelson touched by Rhodes he gets up starts running it does not look like he was she picks up but at the Green Bay first down out to the 43 and I think the reason why people will focus on stopping Eddie Lacy is because of the style his run you know they have a much more deeper respect for green baize running game after last season what he did but it's also that style when he gets rolling he's like a Marshawn Lynch Chris Ivory from the Jets he's that physical tackle breaking gets the whole offense excited gets the whole team excited if you let him roll he said a franchise working record last season just for over eleven hundred yards went to the Pro Bowl there is a fracas Lacy's bottled up by Everson Griffin's holding offense left tackle David Bakhtiari Everson Griffin's doing a nice job you know he's nine sacks coming into the game and what I'm impressed with it just just a complete package up there in the defensive line a great play against the run getting that penetration tripping up Eddie Lacy in the backfield even after he got mugged their grant for the NFC Defensive Player of the Month in October you didn't have to lose him Jared Allen the Vikings third of the league in sacks like Ferdie they get out of the sack today with black last week by the bears on the screen it's Lacey lacy is a cross midfield picks up a first down till the Vikings 43 there is another flag lazy games 24 but it's coming back that's that's really where he's number 17 replay first Adam Parvati Adams anyway she's really starting to get some attention because of his ability in the passing game pass protect are then here on the screen we'll see where Davante Adams on the outside right there you can see him it's just technique you can't get beat to the inside you know it's a screen play it's coming to yours time so make sure you have inside leverage on the person covering you don't let him beat you across the face and get to the inside of the play or you're gonna have to push him in the back hey chef Josh Robinson so now it is first and 27 the 26 yard line James Starks in the backfield for Green Bay Rogers passes behind a Adams who committed the penalty on the previous play and that will come with time Aaron Roger is looking for that back shoulder throw you're going to get to a certain position in your coverage where it doesn't make sense to go stride for stride down the field in coverage so that's that back shoulder throw and it's just going to take time for a young receiver to develop that chemistry with the quarterback second down at 27 empty backfield we'll receivers plus the tight end Wallace routers moving to his right now he throws looking for starts Robinson defending they really need to credit the four guys up front because they're able you've got the linebackers walked in which and Greenway anthony bar but they're pulling out they're getting into coverage so that's just a fourman rush and it's continually gotten aaron rodgers off the spa during the course of the games and they've got seven people back in coverage James Starks had him beat over the top and Aaron could not get that buff wrong the way he wanted because of the scramble on the outside to identify the origin twentyseven Rogers steps away from Griffin but the Minnesota Shack that's just a situation he was sitting at third and twentynine you're trying to get the ball downfield just find somebody's shot I'll throw it to them let them run with it don't take the hit right here you you know you get out to the side you're gonna scramble anything can happen out there it's it's a play well defended by Minnesota take what the defense is giving it and go on to the fun honey from his 13 yard line Cheers Kurt said rolls all the way back to the 23 yard line but to not look like Cheryl's call for a fair catch 39 could sit down field on the coverage he arrived before the ball arrived actually goes off to meet Ria's good since had not contact with Marcus Cheryl's pigcatching interference kicking team number 39 so the Vikings with terrific field position following the penalty trailing by four as Brian Robinson big sack on the last Green Bay possession is mataji getting what you say both to say something negative but upset with us well his offense will try and in the Vikings to leave they start from midfield birds water to passion Patterson able to gain 8 on first down to the Packers 42 and I think that this is one of the ways you have to start your game as well cordarrelle Patterson get him involved you know do these little jump back bubble screens on the outside allow him to use his athleticism as he grows as a receiver as he starts to learn the intricacies of running the routes and getting off press and does something more than just flatout foot speed you know you've got to find opportunities to get the ball in his hand know it from the outside number 52 seen a couple times you're trying to adjust that on a hot rod if you're gonna let the Blitz ago instead of picking them up in protection there has to be an adjusted route for that ball to come out quicker good job by play map he's getting in the middle that throwing on I think on the first trying to pin everybody to the inside and get this thing kicked to the outside right away here comes Kyle Rudolph pins the inside Phil Lowell whole load hold out and around with a good block on Matthews there to God Joe ban you'd get the edge three carries twenty yards for value today 34 it's bounded again up the middle wrapped up by Morgan Burdette this time against just one that's a good play coming down to the outside and squeezing it to the inside there's Morgan Burnett stand up at the end of the line of scrimmage they've got nobody to account for him he's able to slide in and make that tackle yeah they tried to bring Charlie Johnson around on the pull but he's got to keep coming we're done a nice job to going Duncan up underneath and making her down at nine he was looking for Johnson and again there's some of that accuracy then coach Zimmer wanted to see improved here in the second half gonna be cleared up by Rhett Ellison on the initial slant and you got to get that on the body a little bit more well he saw earlier in the day you know Teddy actually looking off one thing he hasn't he's been looking exactly where he's throwing here in the second half on all the passes that I've seen so far those receivers to connect with Johnson it was wide open we saw one of these earlier and this is one of these opportunities to make a big play it's going to be kind of a tough home you go down in and then back out you're gonna sell that post and then break to the corner you get the you spin Sam Shields right into the ground you got Charles Johnson standing there wide open and you just can't make the connection so here is Walsh this'll be a 51yard attempt in his career he is 16 of 20 for 50plus from yes again from 50plus product the Minnesota Vikings to it in one we are back in Minneapolis with producer Barry Landes director Brian Lilly Eddie Albert Daryl Johnston Tony Siragusa following the 51yard field goal by Walsh it is now a onepoint game backers will start from their 20 why do we return to Minneapolis the Packers lost two of their first three games and what was Aaron Rodgers bestest to the fan base relax it's one of the more prophetic statements you know it was just the environment it was the way the team was playing he said we're fine at that time and he may have to say it again after today because there were expectations in this game for Green Bay to continue to play that way I don't think it has anything to do with them not being at Lambeau this is a divisional game Mike Zimmer knows this offense while he's played it before this is this is a group that that played well at times the first goaround so our credit to what the Minnesota Vikings defense is doing here throughout this game Packers six and one since just told everybody to relax check it down just passes taught at Nelson breaks free but there is a flag personal foul sir defense lakeville Joseph the former TR giant I mean he touched him I mean he probably could have avoided them but it's one of those ones Tony where you just don't give him the opportunity to throw the flag yeah it's got the crown lowered it's just frustration I mean he's elusive he's breaking contain you got four guys I mean you're busting your butt all day you're just not get in there for the sack yeah well you got to pull up you gotta pull up it's just area sometimes back cells it really well it's touch by Harrison Smith it was intended for Andrew Corliss if that shoulders all right boy he was fully extended as he went for that interception almost or less looks like he slowed down a little bit in this route if you were to just cover on it he would have been right there never know when the balls coming to you Rogers hop second down complete two cob he's rustled out by captain Morrowind it was ruled down before the ball was knocked free 8a for on the play for calm report ball guy on the sideline players were yelling at him get out of the way when the ball is there but the official was blowing the whistle the ball was dead where'd guys got to Giants next I'm sorry come Sabri yeah she's on third and six cow Randall Cobb the Vikings 45 a 13yard connection this this is tough do to your asking your your wide receiver to come into the middle of the field a lot of courage on this route because you know you're you're running that scan that slant that skinny post you know the safety is dropping down you know you're going to get hit right after you catch this ball done by Randall Cobb Rogers now he throws it out of bounds in the vicinity of cobb as we head to Los Angeles for a game break till class Joe Haeg ants go to Chicago that once potent Bears offense while they just got on the board in the third quarter Cutler Shawn Jeffrey yard TD catch ten seven Buccaneers and lovey Smith's return to Chicago Kenny moose and goose alright thanks to all the parents played each of these teams over the last two games lost in the pack is 55:14 event the Vikings last week 2130 one hands off Lacey bounce it to the outside the tackle beautifully by Harrison Smith that's a great shoestring tackle a couple of things that Mike Cera said his team had to do well is number one play tight coverage we see that a number times today the other thing tackle well after the catch or getting after Eddie Lacy and they have really done a nice job all afternoon in all those areas obviously he can't be perfect there's been a couple breakdowns here and there but for the most part this Minnesota defense done everything that Mike Zimmer has asked them to do but police by Rodgers it's gousen at the 30 so the Packers will send out the field goal unit and look to extend this onepoint lead they said Crosby out to attempt a 48yard field goal he's got the windows back organizer window but the left hash past a places it down and Crosby's kick from 48 is good though the Packer is late third quarter now lead by four 48 yard Mason Crosby field goal and I play 50 yard drive Aaron Rodgers and the Packers lead the Vikings by 4 backers at seven and three I'm fifty Detroit Lions who trail to England 27 the six third quarter and Fox Darrell Patterson out to the 37 and he remains down following his 42yard return see what happens at the end of this run Morgan Burnett the safety he's on the top of the shoulder and pulled down and then he gets rolled up and then you've actually got Sam Barrington coming on so he's got the weight of two players on top of him good to see him up he's up jumping around though didn't look good when he went down last year Paterson returned to kick a hundred nine yards against the Packers five for the longest play in league history so the Vikings trailing by four start from their 37 yard line this is mckennon he picks up 11 Vikings first down again it's one of the things that the North Turner said to us you know we've got to play well as a team so the run game can still be an option for us in the second half and the fact that they're able to hand the ball up here on first downs and be productive very critical to their success we've talked about Aaron Rodgers saying the word relax that's one thing his defense can't do it looks like right now they're too relaxed they need to go and make something happen turnover or at least stop the line of scrimmage and they can make a wall up there because right now they're getting rolled longest run of the day for McKinnon to package territory to the green baize 48 we had Clay Matthews on the runthrough and jerk McKinnon almost found his way exactly back to where Clay Matthews had left see right there the little hop step to that side and then I'm gonna get right back where you just left coming through hide with an interception earlier an allison that's one of the big things for young running backs in the NFL and it's passed protection in Jerick McKinnon to come across but it's just in bad position and he allows Micah Hyde to get back to the inside take away that inside shoulder you want to take away the inside shoulder make the Blitzer run a bubble up and around beyond the pocket never give him the opportunity to come across and get inside of you and protection that could sound from the game for the Packers v\u00e4lf\u00e4rd she's must get to the Green Bay 43 water camping once lives to midfield and the Vikings will pucked it away a good job by the Packer defense right here little stacked release with cordarrelle Patterson Greg Jennings you can see everybody's covered everybody's blanketed across the field and even when Teddy Bridgewater pulls it down right there and they do a good job retracing getting back in the coverage that offensive line for Minnesota also and they stopped and the defensive line forget any kind of pressure had a lot of time back there Dave Tom wives down third quarter comes to an end here at Minneapolis so the Packers will get the ball back they lead the Vikings by four we start the fourth quarter at Minneapolis Green Bay Packers lead the Minnesota Vikings 1713 Randall Cobb back deep for the Packers awaiting Jeff Locke spot oh snap first it to his right takes it up it covers downfield by captain muddling well Fox Sports supports is proud to work with got your six a campaign that creates opportunities to bring veterans and civilians together and inspires Americans to understand the unique skills and values our veterans bring to our communities upon their return home visit Fox Sports supports calm to learn more it's been it's been an amazing salute to service during the course of the game today out all four branches represented at the halftime we've seen several veterans singled out with tribute to them during the course of it had a couple of World War two veterans which is some disabled there's actually a prisoner of war for four years now pack his stock for their 13 yard line as Rogers hands it off to lacy lacy cos he guards second and nine coming up Green Bay at seven and three backtoback 50point games coming into this one Rodgers numbers today touchdown pass to Richard Rodgers in the second quarter lacy with 70 yards on the ground at a touchdown travel table for receptions 58 yards on second down the fake to lacy Watchers to the outside and there is a flag out of the 32 I just so impressed how quick he can go from being on the run to releasing the football yeah he gets his body set extremely quickly to good basically on the ground holding defense number 24 good base on the ground to get that ball off a holding call on the left corner captain Marlin rattled of Andrew Corliss Rogers knocked down by the rookie out of UCLA Anthony bar so its first intent for the Packers from their 20 following the penalty first out handoff to Lacey lacy falling forward out across the 22 they've continued to do a really nice job on this outside zone run they they've just never allowed Eddie Lacy to get to the point where he can plant his foot make that one cut and get downhill everybody keeps their position they stay square they keep moving to the outside and press them all the way to the sidelines and their pursuit to the ball is awesome all the guys all eleven guys are running to the ball that's just eats up all those little gaps that lacy could go and usually five can't find them today let us see only two yards Cruz on his last four carries set it down at eight Rochester Nelson another nice tackle this one by Josh Robinson the Packers now facing a third down at two another big thing this Viking defense has done a nice job of how many how many deep balls have we seen Aaron Rodgers complete over the last couple of games and really not anything today that was big he had a big screen to Eddie Lacy they got called back on a penalty but doing a real nice job protecting that deep wall his longest replacement 34 yards to the tight end Wallace third down and two Rochester Nelson for a first down Jordy Nelson out to the 40yard line Packers need to Nelson games 11 scary because he always hits them dead in stride he was running a little slant route right here you're gonna get to the inside press that outside shoulder across on the release and hit in stride and now you've got Jordy Nelson on the run coming to the center of the field Robert Blanton with a good tackle there to clean that up first two cats out the 40 Rogers turned out she at the last instant was Josh Robinson and this is the defense that you get the big plays down the field you've only got a single safety in the middle of the field so he's got to work both sides and you get Jordy Nelson with the right play call he's going vertical and you can see Harrison Smith was going to be a little bit late getting there they've been they've been frustrating Aaron Rodgers this afternoon in the passing game seen that response on several occasions second attempt Gracie lacy out to the 40 warrior online it will be third down at six it is so different when you get into these divisional games and then one of their big games was against Chicago that's a divisional opponents Chicago at a good time had that big offensive output that day you get Philadelphia last week and you know the things get away from you again and everybody's thinking well here goes the Packers are on a roll then all of a sudden you get to that opponent that really knows you well right now Mike Zimmer's defense done a heck of a job this afternoon his musket to midfield for a first to some third in six steps up has room picks up a first down at door Aaron Rodgers out of bounds at the Minnesota 38 that's an 18 yard run for Rodgers as long as this season and if you're going to bring both your backers you have to understand that you've got to get home if you don't get home if you bring everybody and you allow Aaron Rodgers to the outside you're in man coverage there's going to be a ton of room for him to run he recognizes it right away pulls the ball down and it also signaled that that might be the one on Fox Sports 1 as he was running for the first guys canteen ah peace took you 12 weeks to get it in because the punch rajesh nearside Gelson Jordy Nelson is tackled at the 30yard line by Josh Robinson he needs to get up and give a little bad that had the Randall Cobb on that one because he had a heck of a block to keep Jordy Nelson clean on that play little better rhythm on this drive right here another passing game that running game really wasn't working they just put it in Aaron's hands a little bit brought in better protection and he's taking suck it down and take it's not hand off to Lacey Lacey breaks free for first lacy to the Vikings 15 Robert plantain finally made the tackle as lacy games 15 a good job by the guys up front everybody staying on their man and they create just enough of a crease for Eddie Lacy to squirt through right there Anthony bar just a little bit outside there's that catandmouse game that's been going on at the line of scrimmage with Aaron Rodgers in this Viking defense that will change their stunts and their blitzes according to the what the quarterback is doing to drive for the Packers about the 15 its lacy but to me this is what makes Green Bay dangerous is they can get you quickly they can have the 3play foreplay scoring drive from 8085 yards out or they can get into this style and just pound you with any lacy the short passing game finally runs by Aaron Rodgers and take time off the clock see it right there up on the top left five minutes 53 seconds so far 10play Drive Lacey's only hundred yard game this season came against the Vikings at Lambeau back in October he is now at 88 yards today second down and five Rogers shovel pass Lacey inside the five spins to the throw line touchdown his second of the day that's scary when you can do either way to get to the end zone the explosive play with chunky ARDS or just the physical style and and this is the guy that has brought that to this Packer offense will the touchdown on the field all scoring plays are reviewed the previous play is under review so cleat plate bin we'll take a look at it rule the touchdown on the seals looks like Lacey broke the plane we rate the call for a referee cleat Lake but here it comes after review that play the ruling on the field stands his calls second touchdown of the day for Eddie Lacy of the Packers remember going into the end zone all that ball has to do is break the front of the white on the goal line it doesn't have to go all the way across coming out of the end zone to prevent a safety that ball has to be all the way outside that white line but going in it just has to break that initial point bad for Aaron Rodgers that is his 30th touchdown pass of the season his second today 30 touchdowns three interceptions for Rodgers unbelievable unbelievable how he's played biggest lead of the day for Mike McCarthy and the Green Bay Packers two touchdowns today for Eddie Lacy he had 38 yards on the last Packers drive 11 plays 87 yards Green Bay leading by 11 last return for Minnesota orchestral stakes it out tomorrow a lot oh boy the tackle oh the Packers coming into this game backtoback 50point games fifth time it's been done in history twice in 1950 and then each of the last three years and on the bottom what each team did in that third game that next game after scoring 52 times in a row and the Seattle Seahawks scored the most points the following week with 42 against the 49ers Packers with 24 today Levi 11 from the 21 yard line teddy in his seventh start to the tightend red LS ship play Matthew's the tackle gate of five they've been able to respond after Green Bay has had scoring drives during the course of the game today we'll see hit 30 Bridgewater does with his group on this possession Vikings have had some productive fourth quarters three times this season they've scored in the fourth video Jamison again Ellison picks up the Vikings first down with just under 8 minutes remaining Bridgewater 50 percent completion rate one touchdown one pick 54 yards on the ground for McKinnon the former Packer Charles Watson with his first career score from the 32 on first down Bridgewater dumps it off it's bad here joke's on you page six out to the 38 yard line Green Bay has done a nice job of taking away the intermediate and the deep route and they're forcing Teddy Bridgewater to check the wall down again I mentioned this I like his poise in the pocket he's a young guy he continues to move forward you can see his eyes right there he's scanning the right side of the field trying to see what's there and we saw him get impatient one time in the first half throw the interception but the gorge the game he's made good decisions walk to power he picks up a first down Grinch water the last pick of the first round third quarterback taken behind Brett bortles and Johnny Manziel grew up in the Miami area told us he enjoyed watching Dan Perrino but his favorite quarterback of all time Brett Favre how many times do we hear that every year you know I think one of the big things was the way that Brett Favre played the game he had so much fun when he was on the field and is that you saying so in four or five years all the young quarterbacks gonna be saying Aaron Rodgers was one of my favorite he's always smiling water takes off he is down on the slide of the 47 remember if you slide feet first it's where your first hit that's where you are ruled down so Bridgewater about a yard and a half shy of of a first out three wide receivers set for the Vikings they keep it on the ground and pick up a first down to the Packers 44 bantered would never carried the ball at an NFL game prior to today's in a second season and he's done a nice job he really hasn't over five precarity that's after a busy week you know with Matt Asiata out and jerk McKinnon nursing that sore back Mike Harris has just replaced fill load moulds right tackle prior to this play Pepper's right in front of them what's an opposing figure when you look to throw and Julius Peppers is right there in your face that's one of the guys you can't outrun Julius Peppers again we've seen really nice coverage from both of these defenses today tramonto Williams stride for stride down the sideline there nowhere for Teddy Bridgewater to go with the football both secondaries played well today peppers I did the athleticism is just off the charts for somebody that that's that big bass rush play the run does it all he's got interception returns he's running away from running backs at that size they after dr. J Julius Erving and the athleticism is carried over you that Jake lays her on the right not big enough oh yeah to to Thompson yeah he's over five four for beta here in his second intent for the Vikings who trail by 11 complete to Johnson Burnett to tackle Johnson awarded the first down on forward progress couple of crossing routes underneath the pull the linebackers up opens up Charles Johnson that intermediate level the 33 on first down which water shuffles to his left contended for kennings hock Clinton dicks able to break it up well he had an interception in the first half because he got a little impatient here he's going to be sliding to his left and he's going to throw the ball back into the middle of the field on the right that's dangerous that flared the dry for the Vikings second which water steps up he was grabbed as he got another flag is thrown yeah there's gonna be a holding call also holding offense number 75 Kaleo his third penalty today you know once you get bought beat on the outside you just got to let him go and Khalil right here he gets beat on the outside by heel and just grabs them and if you go down to the ground it doesn't even have to be a grab we talk about this all the time with the officials see the defensive guy after he's beaten the offensive linemen go down to the ground the flags coming out that Mac fields if you need to just stay Square to the line of scrimmage a little bit longer he's really kind of releasing that left shoulder Turner that he's allowing that defensive rusher to turn the corner a little bit too soon from the 43 on second and 20 the catches baby by the time head rid off at the Packers 27 yard line a 16 yard completion well done by Teddy Bridgewater he's gonna break contain he's gonna get outside he's gonna reset his feet on this throw so he's coming off of a nice platform and you can see the delivery right the Kyle Rudolph and again you can see he's definitely not 100% coming back from that injury earlier this year but getting it out I think once he gets healthy it's this season or next season he's going to be an important cog in this offense moving forward the tight end very important in north turner system now taken with 447 to play Mike McCarthy has challenged the last play the catch by the tight end Rudolph who was ruled to catch on the field and we bring in Mike Pereira in Los Angeles Mike what did you see well I think it's a catch because he gets controlled two feet down makes a football move and then he's knocked to the ground he's not going to the ground in the process so to me the fact that the ball comes out when he hits the ground is not really relevant receiver complete control of the ball in bounds and made it move in common to the game therefore he could play the catch inbounds the ruling in the field is confirmed yeah Mike did that cleat Blakeman call you while he was under the hood so did your familiar no I've got a it's a little Morse code here than going on videos well the language from Clete nearly identical to that of Mike Pereira thanks Mike so that is a catch we're down at four the factories 27 let's take a look at see who jump first just don't know why the center doesn't snap the ball right now it was my deal so a new set of downs for the Vikings first and ten from the Green Bay 22 oils in its Kenny's Greg Jennings inside the 10yard line and the Vikings are in the red zone Darryl for the first time today a nice catch by Greg Jennings again you know Teddy just a little bit off on his accuracy today get that ball out in front he's got it on the back shoulder but Greg Jennings is he went up and made a big catch for him in the first half that one's on the back shoulder into traffic first and goal which water steps up he's inside the five hadn't tackled Raika hi again I like the fact that he's always moving forward and there's been no adjustment by Green Bay to clog that middle get those two big tackles there and then just there's some athleticism some elusiveness from teddy bridgewater afterwards he gained some yards second and goal from the fiveyard line Johnson in the slot in motion her tenth play of the drive that's a nice response by this Vikings off it long drive down the field nice job teddy bridgewater there with the inability to step up because Green Bay does flood that area and not allow him to come and you can see all the players they've got committed to the center of that pocket so he has to now buy time drifting backwards is able to get enough time to get the ball to Greg Jennings you know it's great Jennings going against his old team was not good drop that ball boost they looked at women made sure that was a catch and now the allimportant twopoint conversion to make this a three point game for Jennings his first touchdown against his former team Mikey was cold for two we're back of the 15yard line Bridgewater Fox Johnson for the twopoint conversion not a smart play by Mike Neil one of the great things about norms offense is once he finds something that beats you he's going to stay with it and he's just going to window dressing differently on the touchdown it was Greg Jennings coming across the field and he was wide open here's the twopoint play and it's Charles Johnson and there's the hit that Tony was talking about yeah he took an extra step and a half the ball is out so that's not the kick off the penalty committed by Mike Neil and if they didn't get that if they didn't make that or drop the ball or something to give another opportunity I get another twopoint conversion so a thirteen play 79yard drive first two touchdown game for that in bridgewater as the Vikings the twopoint conversion has pulled to within three I wonder what they're going to do with this kick here I think it's gonna be interesting to see I'm not thinking about about an onside kick but with Blair Walsh she's gonna kick it deep you just a lot him to kick it through start at the 20yard line do you try and get cute do you try to do one of these little bloop kicks down into one of the corners and maybe catch Green Bay in a position where you can get the ball or you can get a tackle made inside the 10yard line I would not on sidekicking from the 50 said too deep the Packers when a threepoint lead will start from their 20 week 12 continues later today on CBS at four some of you on Fox then tonight Sunday Night Football on NBC and tune in tomorrow for Monday Night Football couple of touchdown passes for Rogers coming off the backtoback 50point games Packers by themselves Rajesh has not even put in the game at this point there's Lucy date of three and this is the time that having a guy like Eddie Lacy in the backfield really pays dividends this is that four minute offense that special part of the game where you're trying to just run this clock out not give the Minnesota Vikings an opportunity to get their offense back on the field any lease he's going to give you a great opportunity to do that excuse me and he got Kunz in right there the fullback goose what up holes for Lacey for Lacey it's a second hundred yard game this season both against the Vikings shutting down and seven it's lacy again I see out to the 28th ever should Griffin the tackle and now the Vikings will use a timeout with 231 remaining and the Packers lead by three so a big play coming up if the Vikings stopped the Packers here defensively then Minnesota will get the ball back well we talked about what they had to do in the first half and they did a tremendous job of doing that really kind of slowing that Packer offense down but it's a 60minute game I've been so impressed by the play of the Minnesota Vikings here again in the second half and the response that they've had offensive ly Green Bay's moved the ball gone down the field taken the lead and Minnesota has been able to respond right back down and score points on these drives so it's all going to come down to this play they've got big Eddie Lacy in the backfield and then that Vikings defense has played well all afternoon we'll see if they've got one more good snap in them you need to be careful though you just can't play the run hundred percent third down and two they keep it all the growling place he picks up a first down out to the 32 yard line I like the call because you've got your linebackers walked up into that front expecting pass like Tony saying they're not in a good position to take on the block so that surged by the offensive line of the Green Bay Packers with a linebacker and a twopoint stance there's just about a yard and a half off the ball you can see Anthony bar right there getting washed to the outside I like the play call running right into where those standup linebackers were in the a gaps we hit the 2minute warning new set of downs for the Packers Vikings can stop the clock just once two minutes remaining Vikings have one timeout so if the Packers did not pick up a first down Minnesota can get the ball back with under 1/2 Bennett bought the clock first and ten from the 32 the lazy following the fullback Coon and Lacey with a push is out to the 37 a gain of five and now the Vikings will use that vital timeout scary thing about this Packer offense now is they can beat you with the passing game like they did last week against the Philadelphia Eagles but have you choose to take away that running game they now have Eddie Lacy and he has been the key this afternoon the way that Minnesota defended this offense gave him the opportunities you can see what he did with that 24 carries for 115 yards one touchdown rushing that's what makes this Packer offense scary in my opinion and this team in general they can beat you quickly like to have the last two weeks and they grind it out in the physical game like they have this afternoon lacy picks up a first down and that will do it the Packers will be able to run out the clock Minnesota with no timeouts remaining it's kind of funny talking with Aaron Rodgers on Saturday and we asked him you know why do you think you guys have been so successful offensively he said well what did coach McCarthy have to say and so he'd really mention you he had a lot of nice things to say about Eddie Lacy we had a we had a good laugh and talked and he has a tremendous amount of respect he's like listen he goes I know how much defenses have to respect this guy in the backfield and it really allows me to play the game differently this year I think that this aggressive passing game that Green Bay has implemented this season is a big result of people trying to take away and respecting Eddie Lacy right there in the run game dad it makes those offensive linemen also and you have a run game and you know you're gonna pound it and round it a little bit and get that push it makes it easier for an offensive lineman to come off the ball and keep those defensive linemen guessing know when you just go back and you pass you know 60 70 times a game it just becomes too much a finesse game too easy for that defense to read exactly what you're doing with that onetwo punch so you talked about there okay it makes it really hard as a defense to figure things out so the Packers go to eight and three Detroit losing late in New England for Mike McCarthy regular season win number 90 that's one more than Vince Lombardi trilling only Curly Lambeau in franchise history Packers will host New England in a late game next Sunday Vikings dropped to four and seven they will host the Carolina Panthers so the Packers don't score fifty but they pick up the win by three over the Vikings will return to Minneapolis after these messages you're watching the NFL on CTV powered by SportsCenter",

  "transcript": "it's firsthalf highlights are brought to you by nationwide official sponsor of the NFL Pass in for a touchdown deep and there's Brian touchdown enjoy touchdown nationwide is on your side because the winner of the division obviously with at least at worst posts a wild card game and the way things are going right now if you finished second in this division you may not get into the playoffs even with 11 victories and the Cowboys cannot win the division if they have the same number of wins as digital so doubly important for the Dallas Cowboys tonight and down in the end zones is Harrison well for Dez Bryant has been involved in a few plays even before the game Jenkins he's been working on the outside against Bradley Fletcher with great success and you have to remember that it was Carrie Williams two fouls that kept alive the two touchdown drives for the Dallas Cowboys as well so both corners have had a big role here in the first half of this one and let's see what Romo decides to do here on this Drive in the third quarter had good balance to this point we start with Murray the league's leading rusher for a gain of five to the 25 when we check in on the show well Kelly told me he thought he they did a pretty good job defending Dallas's run but they gotta stop Jason Witten on third down he converted three of them and also they need to sustain drives offensively that's for Jason Garrett he thought they kept up with Philadelphia's pays pretty well he said they just plan to mix it up more defensively here in the second half I Thank You Michelle the according to tell me did a pretty good job Amari they have 15 carries 51 yards so he's averaging about three and a half toad and here he goes again bottled up again doing a good job on the Dallas run game we've got Parnell in it right tackle for the 78 damn for free they have rotated in the past I don't know if that's what's going on here or if something happened but of experience in this three games earlier the season with a foot injury third down and six now and that a flag was the Eagles came across Vinnie curry all start offense number 83 fiveyard penalty he was drawn off his Terrence Williams was the first to move parks about it I don't know that Benny fries saw Terrance Williams on the outside but so he just got safe he did there's Williams flinched Mary way himself then he curry no way saw that so got everybody on that makes you a third down at 11 from the 19 yard line six BBS in the game got a flag two flags in fact Terrence Williams Terry Williams was back there covering bow number three yep and it's going to be defensive pass interference defense number 26 automatic first down all he has to do is get his head around and he could have made the play on the ball would not have been interference he's in great position the defense number 23 in that penalties decline down the field just turned your head around here you can have contact at that point but if the heads not around you're not allowed to do that good call by the officials so a third down and 11 becomes a 40 yard penalty well I tell you it is kept alive two touchdown drives already and who knows this could be a third from the Phillies 41 yard line Harris Kosovo client was wide left bottle them up again for a loss and chicken once more in the show well Doug free as you mentioned is not in on the game right now he is questionable with the right angle in jewelry he's on the sidelines without a helmet heavily taped around that ankle and you know limping quite a bit al so right now not in there there he is we saw on the sideline Michelle so Parnell is in there now a fifthyear guy out of this is sipping and right tapping while he tried to go that way to no avail on that last one second down and 11 under pressure they get to just got a thump off the knock them down take them out of the 50 yard line for the sack we talked about Fletcher Cox a little bit earlier in this game and going through both Parnell and Zack Martin here doesn't get there but horses Tony Romo to step up and when he does he trips over his own man sort of Auto sacks himself on Tyrone Smith we're going to give the sack to Thornton a bit of a gift but we'll take it then it makes a third down on 19 way clock at one the pushing again he's a Terry Williams Terrence Williams I think that one might be on Terrence Williams pass interference offense number 83 was the fine work that good job officiating there that time completely opposite of like Kerry Williams had done in the past gets his head around Terrence Williams tried to push him off and died really not a bad effort by Terrence Williams why not you're sitting out there and third and a million and you never know sometime you get away with it and a fourth in a million for them 19 Chris Jones Bearcats gold Ford made by schools at the 14 eleven and a half to go in the third quarter status by draw Tuesday don't miss the voice live finale the voice all comes down to your vote the voice live finale tomorrow Tuesday on NBC both nights Comcast a spectacle hearing Philadelphia in fact become too broad and Patterson Street Sounds Philadelphia Lincoln Financial Field Philadelphia with its first possession of the second half starting from a 40yard line and it's a two yard game for LeSean McCoy second and eight see how the play calling works Jim Kelly and the Mark Sanchez and then it's all the individual coaches to their individual positions so they can go this fast we'll take you to the 19 yard line one more time Bruce Carter makes the stop third down if Kelly's ready right away but here he needs to make a substitution which is going to allow the Cowboys so you'll see the pump fire now hold the snap he will hold the snap see if the Cowboys want a substitute they do not so they're ready for play we stay with the base defense scores comes in for the Eagles have stirred down in five from the 19 yard line Macklin comes in motion to the inside we're a first that what Carter gambled on him trying to cut in front a ticket or at least the Fleck did instead it's a first down of Macklin Bruce Carter was right there if he reaches over and touches him there all he does right there the fall is going to be down I thought it might have been short but just enough an immaculate second catch of the night 460 yards is a leading receiver fires over the middle wall and incomplete flag is tended receiver was macula very church going to get called for a hold it is this is like a lane that's number 42 fiveyard penalty automatic first down well we've seen three penalties on Carey Williams tonight that is the first penalty on Church all season it's his arms wrapped around good call by the officials this is this is like an old school football game this is the way the game used to be played when you could do be a little physical down the field move it out to the parking lot boring tries to dance around and it's smothered by Terrell McLean it's going to be interesting to see if the lead makes any adjustments to that fiveyard bump rule in the offseason because what we have sure seeing a lot of those flags this season mmhmm probably to money yeah I would say so too comes the face again second down and 11 overthrown that incomplete branding far covering Matlin can you see that card that there isn't we asked Chip Kelly what is SE mean what does it mean you wouldn't give it up no we've been as Sanchez what he doesn't know what it means he didn't know so it's obviously not part of the game planning but and it changes it's not the same every year kids for Halloween they takes si to the Halloween party reason third and 11 Sanchez able to step up to buy time and then it smack them down a sideline transient by Wilcox with a block from Matthews get in they're going to rule him down at the oneyard line wow that ball came out too and it was close they're marking it down it's 72 yard Philadelphia doesn't want Dallas to have the opportunity to challenge to they race down to the field they race down and he was down there's the challenge lap becomes that but did he get it out in time and the official coming in saying yes he did yeah so Garrett looking for something from upstairs meanwhile they sprinted down the field 70 yards through the Eagles to try to get the play off before it could even be challenged the first look I thought his knee was down at 72 yards on a third and 12 there's the elbow down he's reaching he is down right there the only question at that point is was it a touchdown or not Dallas's challenged at the rumrunner fumbles and they clearly recovered time out well they did but we think he was down at the oneyard line and it should be a first and goal when we come back after here the ruling on the field has confirmed the runner was down by contact Dallas is charged with their first screen timeout Bilbo was down the only thing that could have overturned on that they could have called it a touchdown right but by sprinting down the field the Philadelphia Eagles now forced Jason Garrett to use one of his timeouts which could come back to haunt later no doubt she's clearly down it could have been the double whammy they lose the challenge and a good of the touchdown this far they can get his right hand in there and Macklin's off to the races 272 Brandon Carr has not had a good year and he is a bigmoney cornerback for the Cowboys sir smoke is the running back he's already scored a touchdown tonight and make it a pair what's that eagle 17 unanswered points that is after the extra point upcoming it's going to make it a four point game after the conversion Jason Peters right there just wiping down the entire side of the line of scrimmage big strong physical and boy I tell you what the Dallas Cowboys don't even want to think about blowing to their archrivals in this kind of December situation to go in the third before next week the Super Bowl champion Seahawks go to the desert to take on the Arizona Cardinals before life begins at 7:00 Eastern Time on the Cardinals will clinch a playoff spot tonight unless this game ends in a tie Arizona 11 and 300 job these aliens Sunday night Seattle Arizona the one back here to the 16 yard Harris back we go to the pace to mecklen Mark Sanchez watch him he's going to glance right see what he has with Macklin comeback square up the safety now go back there for the big touchdown and for Brandon Carr in his own defense you cannot undercut that play unless you are a hundred percent sure that you're going to get there because there's nobody left the entire side of the field is gone you're the deep bird there you cannot take that chance unless you are positive joined us late it was 21 nothing Dallas the Eagles have scored 17 on points we've got some ballgame escape some wouldbe sack throws corn on the outside by Hannah and the number three tie then Dean 12 what your put the heat on Romo but Tony escaped that time first down that is Tony Romo and his finest right there this is what he can do comes completely unblocked their best interior pass rusher Fletcher Cox he spins out of it and instead of a 10yard sack and maybe a fumble they pick up a first down spinning against the green as he's done so magnificently through his career from the 27 yard line you clearly start through a false start false start offense number nine fiveyard penalty first down Romo himself coming out before the snap boy this is just setting up isn't it these two arch rivals and to have the Cowboys out to 21 nothing lead in the newspaper today and the Philadelphia Enquirer there was action figure cartoon it said warning choking hazard in the cartoon well those are tough street first at fifteen from the 22 the backfield Malcolm Jenkins safety coming up Malcolm Jenkins has just become such an important part of this defense when Tamiko Ryan's their main signal caller went out he became the de facto leader of this defensive team he's the guy that gets upset he's the guy that's forced into tough man coverage situations they're just a lot the first half or more throwing he was covered by Terry Williams so Terence can't handle it third down and 19 next I asked Romo why haven't you thrown more falls at Terrance Williams lately and he said he hasn't been open and on third down and on big downs I go to Jason Witten goto pulled easy and I go the guys I can trust but right now Kerry Williams after a tough first half coming up big here in the second at a time from behind is it alive wall yes curry came from behind the sack fumbled and the Philadelphia recovery you gotta wonder is the Tuck rule in play here never saw Moe tries to pull that down all the way back into his body it's automatically reviewed because it's a turnover Fletcher Cox comes up with a recovery had at least six seven seconds and nobody can get open down the he's brought the ball back to his body and therefore it is a fumble so that is confirmed and the ball of the 14 Sanchez extra quiet and hands the ball off to McCoy who takes the ball inside the 10 flag down he's down at the 8 yard line after the play personal foul unnecessary roughness defense on the 97 Pharrell McClane play is clearly over there and mcclain comes over and the official couldn't miss it the player is not dead dog Wow what a turnaround this has been and it looks like the Cowboys are just unraveling here so first and goal at the floor with an escort bang databound short of the goal line with a moment Anthony Hitchens is there to save the touchdown that looked like it was going to be a walk in didn't and then the Anthony Hitchens a young rookie who has been so effective playing all three linebacker positions it's there just in time makes it a second down and goal and swells Boulton the game it comes falls into the backfield spoils to the outside he goes touchdown Eagles how about this one let's LeSean McCoy lead block he's a fullback now he was the leading rusher in the league last year you say why can't you play LeSean McCoy and Darren Sproles in the backfield together well neither one we're gonna block John McCoy just played a heck of a block on the edge there scrolls with his six rushing touchdown very with a discus thrower the ice a 21point deficit has turned into a threepoint lead for the Eagles up something a football little bit of happier seen in owner Jeffrey Lurie's box at one point twenty one month in balance now 24 21 Philadelphia and the run back here to the 22 yard line Fort Greene Harris Tony Romo let that long drive earlier and of course it's a different story with Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey who is the lifelong Dallas Cowboy fan to the consternation of John Mara and Jeff morena everybody else on both sides of the Garden State so be it Texas vote from the 22yard line the Dallas Cowboys so I went for the first time in the this is Marie nice job by Murray he's now carried the ball at a total of 19 times for 47 yards that sold less than three yards per carry starting to get back to the way the first game was and really since Doug free went out of the game we have not seen whatever success they had running the football to that right side been tough shutting sense five minutes in the third second down fires over the middle caught at the 40 yard line dez bryant who has scored two touchdowns tonight takes the ball out to the 45 yard line nice route by dez bryant down the field they've got kendrick sitting in here in the middle of the field as a lurker they threw right over the top of him this has been getting a lot of double coverage tonight but now when everything is on the line and your team is struggling you go back to your superstars and that's Dez Bryant let's uh me lined up to the right now he comes into the slot on the let's get coming run we'll get to the way it's picked up a first down that's an 11yard gain to the 44 yard line that was Michael Kendricks that came on the Blitz and got a good shot on Romo so they're starting to get some hits on Romo we've seen him limping around just a little bit looking a little ginger he comes up inside and we want to see Romo on the ground as much as possible bang that birthday stop England one maybe to go back to Thanksgiving Day inhale Tony Rojo and that one clearly didn't take the shot you can see could get nothing into that through some floating interceptions tonight he's been much sharper crisper you see a little bit more torque on those throws driving it out of there dez bryant and has something started with this product 44 second down and meet Maria again and this side Marie takes off Marie inside the 25yard line to the 20 Priestley finally is able to break one tackle there by Jenkins first down Dallas it's a gain of 21 yards for DeMarco good blocking here good blocking here Travis Frederick gets Vinny Logan pinned down inside and Leary just tenacious on that block on bear and really good running by DeMarco Murray that time would have been easy to try to bounce that one he did a little too much of that against Chicago stayed on the path and came up with a big 23 yard line and that cut in fact close that Lane and the hurried Benny Logan right there to stop him second and 11 the real key to play in this stretch for Vinnie Logan is to keep his shoulders Square don't let those offensive linemen get uturned he played that perfectly that time they want him sliding down the line with his shoulders Square all the way down the line there is which allowed them to get back off of Leary and make the play in the backfield five receivers caught inside the 10yard line Bryant to the to the set of a first down and goal his fourth reception of the night two of those have been four touchdowns think they were trying to double with the inside guy running out under Dez and he ends up kind of running underneath if that was Brandon Boykin but two in cuts now to Dez Bryant has this offense back on track what a huge drive this has been because it looked like everything was going against the Cowboys that's good for a gain of 22 this drive started at the damaged 22 first and goal from the team draw the Maria takes the ball into the endzone and so the Dallas Cowboys who blew a 21point lead now take the lead again and the extra point will make it a fourpoint advantage what a game what a game see it time after time whenever they need key yardage short yardage situations third ones goal line they go behind the two young players Travis Frederick Zack Martin inside great running there but we have to give a lot of credit to Tony Romo and Dez Bryant on that Drive where their team desperately needed them and they delivered and Murray broke off at 21 yard run they ran the ball five times through it three times go 78 yards in a little over five minutes be point after and the Dallas Cowboys in the final minute of the third quarter lead Philadelphia 2824 we got a skirmish here well sooner or later flag comes in all of it after the play Nolan Carroll is one of the guys in there Travis Frederick for Dallas after the play personal foul unnecessary roughness defense number 23 15yard penalty assessed on the kickoff timeout well actually make it pretty easy for a touchback when play resumes 39 seconds left in the third on Sunday Night Football this is Sunday night quite a Sunday night game as the Eagles and the Cowboys battle for first place in the NFC East and he could have had an easy touch back instead bailey kicks the ball over a six yard line that was pretty dangerous Huff brings it back to the 21 Church makes the tackle Sunday Night Football things brought to you by nationwide nationwide is on your side by Toyota let's go places by DIRECTV if you call yourself a sports fan you got to get DIRECTV and by night museum secret of the tools Friday only in computers Tuesday the Cowboys visited children's hospitals in the Dallas Fort Worth area and spent time with the kids and their whoa quiet the Metroplex earlier this week from the 21 this drive starts the two coy picking up more than a couple Eagles first two drives tonight six plays no yards and since then 15 first down 24 points give you the final play of the period Sanchez escaping dump it off and have stopped the flock so there will be a little bit more time left Sylvie's but the he thought it'll be third down and seven for Philadelphia Jeremy Maclin working down the field that's where he was trying to get the ball in cart good job just in this game and they've been so many calls down the field he just take your hands off of him say I don't want any part of it but so far the Cowboys defense here now this is what they wanted this game to be they did not want it to be in LeSean McCoy they wanted it to be about Mark Sanchez throwing its role right here on a third and seven pump fake goes over the middle and Wilcox who comes up with the ball it was deflected well if Zach merged his hands and it's an interception got it before it hit the ground and that's the way the third quarter will come to an end the Dallas re taking the lead and getting the ball back on Sunday Night Football back after these messages so we go to the fourth quarter Al Michaels Cris Collinsworth Michele Tafoya here it is again now they changed the rule the Berta Manuel rule they call it about 1213 years ago if you control the ball the ball can hit the ground which it does there and it's legal same thing is it a receiver the guy makes a catch whether it's a captain interception doesn't matter ball controlled by Wilcox Flay stands and Dallas takes over at the 43 yard line of Philadelphia and with a big hole this time all the way down to the 28 yard line so they have held him in to check but of late now 84 yards for restating the importance of this one the winner moves in the first place that will have split the season series the way the NFC is going right now he goes go to Washington in New York so they take a train and a bus Cowboys go home against Indianapolis and at Washington and the Cowboys can't learn that division that they have the same number of wins as we needed us the bulky in particular to the Dallas Cowboys from Murray over the right side Matthews makes the tackles second down one of the things that Philadelphia thought was so important especially in that first matchup as they were able to displace that offensive line on some of those stretch running plays in that time with Doug free on the sidelines they pushed Jeremy Parnell back into the backfield for no gain for a 25 carries tonight 83 yards second attack barri to the 25yard line again Casey Matthews makes the tackle DeMarco Murray who's carried the ball 25 times his first reception of the night he's got to be careful about swinging his ball out away from his body he had five fumbles early in the year as a fumble in last but we've had a few issues without in the past seven deep regret three touchdown catches tonight for Dez Bryant and they beat Bradley Fletcher again this time for 25 yards all three you want to play bump and run you want to play man coverage you got to take on the superstar they have figured out a way they have aligned over Bradley Fletcher all night and Dez Bryant is killing him safety no way to get that far over the top in this place that was a party in a box about 15 minutes ago has gone deadly silent first touchdown Patrick of Brian's career extra point is good and the Dallas Cowboys have reassumed control 35 to 24 tonight's aerial coverage is being brought to you by Geico beautiful shot of downtown school city center city ball right there Dez Bryant with three touchdowns 1214 to go in the fourth Bailey's kick down in the end zone says Brian on the outside looking in sees Bradley Fletcher over him what does Tony Romo say thumbs up baby we're going after him one more time let's go get number three safety in the middle of field Fletcher just no match tonight 13 touchdowns for Dez Bryant now matching his careerhigh and remember the scene before the game when Malcolm Jenkins and he were exchanging pleasantries on the field not so pleasant tonight for Bradley Fletcher when the yard line sanchez under pressure loses his balance goes down at the 19 yard line we live in yarn sack Tyrone Crawford coming through the middle Tyrone Crawford has really become a force inside but this is what the Cowboys were hoping for even though they're running a playaction fake because of the lead now you take that a little bit less seriously Crawford gets in and comes up with the sack mixing second down and 21 restroom and breaking free is cherished puffs at par track him down but not until he reaches midfield and behind so a second down and 21 and Huff makes a huge play this is a young man that was hurt early in the year and a lot of people wondered why he hasn't had a bigger role a bigger one heir apparents deep that substitute number 55 your penalty added banana deployed perfect and that's the Dallas sideline so there he goes sideline interference is what the call was if the referee can't run freely down the boundary and runs into a player or a coach in that white marked off area then it is a foul and usually it happens on plays like that when they break away and that's Carter on the bench here's Huff it's it's 44 yard over here's mcclain right there on the sideline impeding the official so they marked it off down on the 32 yard line and the Eagles McCoy for a gain of one McLain makes the tackle you just wonder where the Cowboys would have been this season without Rolando McClain of course Shawn Lee injured a nonfactor this year Rolando McClain out of football a year ago they make a preseason trade to get him and he hasn't been the man he really runs this defense they say he is the intellectual bog out there the fame it's too high natives are sellers old we've bluebirds coming out on that one pretty wide open was Selleck here you know I'll be able to hit that one course every third then now becomes pretty vital third down and nine if they were stymied here and hard I'll kick a field goal first of all Philadelphia takes a timeout so each is used one you know Chris you brought up that the philadelphia inquirer action figure the Tony Romo cartoon there was also a column written by Mike Seale ski today one of the calm is talking about if the defensive backs don't have a decent night in particular Bradley Fletcher look out that was quite prescient yeah and and it really is because you know what you're going to get with the Philadelphia Eagles defensively they're going to challenge you they're going to play that man coverage and eventually somebody has to take Dez Bryant and tonight since Brian has just been too much reflection on the outside a sketch there and it's been this same place twice over for touchdowns at about the same spot on the field before the game even starts now third and nine here comes the Blitz the pass is caught but short of the first down to the 25 yard line that's at first so it's got a kick 1 2 3 I think you do because it's you make it an 11point game and an eightpoint game so it's still a onepossession game and a lot of time as we've already seen from this Eagles offense they have the ability to fly up and down the field in a hurry 11 minutes to go there are not afraid of that kind of lead this would be a 43yard attempt to your Cody parky and his kick is good attack on three more make it a onepossession 3527 then I football brought to you by Walmart where you'll find unbeatable prices on this year's top gifts by AT&amp;T mobilizing your world by Nissan innovation that excites and by Pepsi hike your hometown with Pepsi at Etsy calm before instead a spherical works by artists like Wendell the cultural Matisse were you with the pink line numbers really good stick figures only my bad me too cotton on the top it's filled it on the wrong Green Harris and the reach dashboard it's popped out of bounds at the 20yard line these two guys Murray and Bryant the centerpieces of that offense gaining more than 60% of the yards from scrimmage to go back to Tiki Barber and flex to go Burris back in Oh 5 and tonight 83 rushing yards two TVs for Murray and Langley 9 receiving yards three touchdowns for Dez Bryant so they have accounted for the 35 that was points I remember talking to Dez earlier in the year he said hey we heard all the people make and find the Dallas Cowboys this offseason it motivated us it helped us train in the office or they could hang on the brink of doing something great the you know of course it's the first time we get the second let's go to Michelle right now well Eagles linebacker Trent Cole went to get an xray on his left hand alveus questionable Brandon Graham has replaced him for the time being all right Thank You Michelle Graham number 55 and there he is good fewer linebacker of the Michigan who's the number one pick back in 2010 yeah no dropoff there they rotate three guys on the outside the issue now for the Eagles defensively is they've already defended 63 plays I think it was 84 85 against Seattle the running game might be more effective for the cowboys here late the Cowboys 64th play and it's Dunbar we'll take the longer the 29 setting up a key third and one you know Chris talking about there's the the guys feeling a little bit disrespected like a lot of players do but it's the first time in five years I can remember the Cowboys very little was expected to them they're always underperforming and this year they're over performance that the expectations were I think even Jerry Jones made the comment that well we may not be so good and you know I mean I think he was wondering what kind of ballclub he was going to have but I think the choice Zach Barton this offensive line way they play three straight years of eight Nate last year this contract here is more stop the ball excellent if this is coming in from the side it's going to be a little bit short of the first down big big stop clock ticks down under nine minutes and they're forced to punt here in the middle they tried to go right behind there to young star offensive lineman and just don't get there what a huge stop by the Eagles defensively now Darren Sproles who can be electrifying we've been watching him through the years back to receive Jones since the tip toward the far sideline bulls collection with a fair catch at the 23 yard line each on the court that was five eight all right so what happens if you put Viveca a fox or ombre Rivera and Terrell Owens in a room together looking fine back on the premiere of The Celebrity Apprentice Donald J Trump premiering January the 4th right here on NBC right now justice start from the 23 and this time begin to the run at least seven yards by shading the koi up to the 30yard line second and three remember Mark Sanchez has played in two AFC championship games with the Jets oh he is used to this kind of pressure second and three for you again a boy with some room flag down up to the 37 a pair of flags at the 30yard line holding offense number 62 10yard penalty second down that's the center Jason Cosi and there goes the first down now Bruce Carter tried to flip around him and he just reached out with that right arm right here you'll see his Carter goes around the back side he reaches out with that right arm and that hurts back to second down second and 13 now walk on the move under that menace the Blitz get up the pass is caught that's a first down that's Brent Celek over the middle the ball taken away from him but the play was over foul Wilbur came away with the ball but it belongs to Philadelphia let's see ball he's moving did anything get to the ground we're gonna have a challenge I think so Jason Garrett he's already challenged once so this is his final challenge he of course lost that challenge so they're down to two timeouts they'll be down a wanted to lose this one humbled proud of being down by contact the ball was moving and he landed on top of the defender if see where it goes we're back in Dallas is going to wind up with the ball because the runner was on top of a cowboy you got Selleck here he goes down on Wilcox he never hits the ground the ball comes loose it's recovered by Wilburn right now they're just checking to see where to spot the ball but Dallas is going to get the ball on the turnover here the runner lost control the football prior to being down by contact it will be first down for Dallas at the 34 yard line police set the game clock to seven minutes 48 seconds so Garrett is not charged with the timeout not charged at the timeout that's their last challenge though because they lost the first one he never touches the ground not a knee not an elbow forearm nothing and for JJ Wilcox that is the second big turnover he's been involved in and for Selleck that's one of those bizarre plays you would say I was down but because there was somebody underneath him he wasn't down so the cowboy was already within long field goal range that make it to of they get any points here they start this drive from the 34 yard line if klutz of the game of fullback here goes Marie to the outside and it's another lost Brandon Graham tackles him behind the line of scrimmage loss of two second down and 12 Brandon Graham has had a sensational year he really is he's sort of a role player five and a half sacks but when you try and run to his side he's like a bowling ball over there they almost tried to convince him to lose weight to play outside linebacker they so forget it just play it the way you like it and so that graphic fewest turnovers in Philly history nineteen last year this year 32 ton overs already in this game of the 14 most in the lead clock at three second and 12 Romo wide open making the catch dez bryant you tonight continues to the 21 and a first down obviously just a completely blown coverage nobody on dez a turn and run out here and here's the guys been killing you all night there's not anybody within 20 yards tough night for the defensive backs of the philadelphia eagles six catches 114 yards and Romo can begin to work on the timepiece right now under six and a half to play Annmarie tackles for another loss behind the line of scrimmage again Brandon Graham Sally this guy's been doing this all season long sneaks inside Tyron smith and go makes a play in the backfield desperately need it because we would love to see Romo I was going to say he'd love to see him put the ball in the air but the way it's been going in the secondary maybe not well they've done a good job on Murray they're not accept that 121 yard scamper nine carries 82 yards it's less than three yards per carry these receivers now second and 14 again milt o'clock fires eventually flag is down Marco Bari held in the backfield holding offense number 29 yard penalty second down only Michael Hendrickson they're in danger of getting back out of field goal range here yeah he had a nice initial block but then as Kendrick started to free himself Murray just grabbed him over here second motion right there he's the one he got called for so second down in 24 right now you'd be looking at a 53yard field court visual negative twopossession lead has to go on an in cut and third and long Williams Terry Williams covering on the play third and twentyfour and now I think they're starting to follow with Kerri Williams they've seen enough of Bradley Fletcher on Dez Bryant so that's the first time all night we've seen Kerry Williams across the field so what do you do here man I'm going through a 10 or 12 yard Dallas to get daily set up you need five or six yards to get that second score under pressure look at shovel pass to the 31 to Whitman so they ain't a few they get four and that's going to set up about a 48 49 yard attempt for Bailey to try to make it an 11 point game not an issue he has a longer 56 yards 506 from over 50 so plenty of range here just couldn't take the sack good job by Romo escaping of course if he misses this one in Philadelphia we'll get the ball in its own 39yard and Bailey is 3 for 3 huge field goal 437 play in regulation 38 27,000 the fans order your holiday gifts are manifold shop calm today save 20% of the official store of the NFL I've already got you a couple of gifts a couple of couple of books I'm going to send it over this beautiful they might be now to be top 10 best sellers right on don't want to write a Shakespeare first was one a week from Thursday it's down in the end zones as the Eagle is now down by 11 points 437 then they have two timeouts as we head down the stretch how about Tony Romo though now on the road 18 touchdowns one interception remarkable three touchdown passes tonight all of them to Dez Bryant meanwhile Sanchez now 15 of 24 started cold a couple of real nice drives and then erased a 21point deficit I'm going to see the Cowboys come back retake the lead starts this drive with the past Macklin is out of bounds right the mortar Brandon Carr after giving up that long one down the field now is giving plenty of cushion here so Sanchez is going to be able to take some of those short quick ones and this offense has enough pace to it you don't have to really change what you're doing from the 30 and pump fakes then throws deep downfield and Riley Cooper is there that's incomplete and the Cowboys cover on the play and Sterling more reaches for his back and is down on the grass tie to the pump fake oh my gosh everybody Barry Church down as well injury timeout it'll be second down and 10 for Dallas and also the game that Cowboys took at 21 but nothing lead before Philadelphia's score 24 unanswered points but then the Cowboys rally Dez Bryant the careerhigh 3 touchdown DeMarco Murray into the twice himself and the Cowboys right now up by 11 and second down and 10 more in church bolt shakin on the last play bolt out for the moment and Sanchez gets bottled up and taken down at the 26 yard line so he hung in the pocket and then Tyrone Crawford and Jeremy minty are both there for the sack here's the coverage down the field of course car now in a much better position Burt's going across the field maybe a shot I'm a little surprised they didn't take a look at Tyler Patman with Riley Cooper at the bottom he was the replacement didn't even check that side 14 were in church or both back in the game and that change is going to get sacked at the 13 yard line by Jeremy Minzy and that's the fourth sack of the night for the Dallas Cowboys Jason Peters is coming out right here and he expects Sanchez to step up and when Sanchez goes backwards all the leverage goes away at that point so you have to just take a couple sacks and I guess you'd say I don't want to step up in there anymore so Mincey gets credit for the sack it's fourth down and 25 Donnie Jones the low liner this bear caught at the 41 yard line so 309 remaining Philadelphia can stop the clock twice plus the time out of the twominute warning and an 11point game and what would be I believe the biggest win of Jason Garrett's career if he could come out of here with one to see his football team that has been known for falling apart in December Tony Romo who has been known for key interceptions late in the year that has hurt this team to see them blow a 21point lead and then go right back down the field retake the lead not lose their composure was huge for this organization from the 40yard line because for them every time hardly had to be a genius to figure that Fletcher Cox makes the tackle and Philadelphia will take a timeout that's the eleventh time tonight that Murray has been held for either no gain or negative yardage it's a tough bunch up there it really is and we've been talking about it all night they did the same thing the difference in this game really was the fact that Tony Romo got something going with the passing game and his mobility the difference in his mobility in this game and what he was on Thanksgiving Day is ninth day and it probably should have been playing on Sunday night come right back to a Thursday he wasn't ready he usually doesn't even practice until Thursday he skips Wednesday practice usually practices for the first time on Thursday he just wasn't ready to play second and ten Marie again he's gonna get taken out for the 12th time without gaining the yardage and Philadelphia now with three minutes we'll take its final timeout so the only time the clock will now stop again will be the twominute warning Mari for the season leads the league by plenty this disaster strikes you and he's gonna wind up leaving it running down records for him Emmitt Smith at 1773 so he's bearing down on that might get it next week at home against Indy the quartet Eric Dickerson for 2105 that would be your your mark that's held since the early eighties 466 best career threegame stretch and tonight he's been the workhorse again 31 carries only 81 yards but two touchdowns had a catch and for the moment he'll come out and Lance Dunbar comes in one first down away now the Dallas Cowboys almost locking this thing up very difficult from their one first down nice meaning out of challenges with it smooth in another 60 seconds anyway Dunbar up to the 43 yard line so the Cowboys will have to punt before the twominute warning but Philadelphia would need two scores and do it without a timeout that's great I agree this would be the this is the big I was just trying to think of the big wins he's had I mean he's debut when he took over for getting garret when he took over for Wade Phillips was a big win in New York but nobody thought they could win they beat Seattle earlier this year but the last three years they've gone down to the last game of the season and lost it and it cost them a chance to go to the playoffs to this team they've lost it yep so then to get blown out on Thanksgiving and expectations plummet and to come back into this building tonight just so impressive because it just felt like you know you know what the headlines were gonna be the Cowboys choked away another you know twenty one point lead they can't win in December they can't win the big games all this kind of stuff they were pecking away that was going to be the story and then they flipped the script dez bryant came up with some huge plays down the field jason witten on that drive but Tony Romo really answered when this crowd was going bananas in here calmly took his team down the field to retake the lead by 11 they punt here it's against Dallas it'll cost them five our offense number fiftyfour fiveyard penalty fourth down so we hit the grass to go to until Arizona to these Seattle Seahawks red hot right now against the Arizona Cardinals with quarterback two about to make the playoffs so the system winds up in a tie Arizona is in at the top spot in the West at stake next week the 23 it is dropped there and then picked back up by Darren Sproles and they'll start the drive from the 24 year 24 I was only half kidding about certain Warner wasn't there a story this week of a Kurt thinking about coming back you saw that right I nothing would surprise me why not Warner was pretty good and there's late season runs you think they would have made him wait wait five more years if he'd come back and played a quarter next week way to the Hall of Fame but what a job that Bruce Arians has done don't know about stand with the weak with a sprained knee lost mama for the season he makes the catch at the 41 and that takes us to the twominute warning with exactly 157 to play and the Dallas Cowboys trying to move into the Volkswagen postgame report Michelle down on the field with the stars of the game Bob Tony and Mike will break it all down we'll look ahead to next week's game between the Seahawks and the Cardinals before we leave here Brad sham one of the really great guys in the business he's been the voice of the Cowboys except for a brief interim spell since 1979 calling his 750th game took over another great pal Verne Lundquist years ago and 750 flip boards and that's intercepted at the 45 yard line grant can send the word all the way back to the Metro flush that Bruce Carter has in effect end of the game and cemented the Dallas Cowboys going into undisputed possession of first place in the NFC East not the night that Mark Sanchez would have hoped for here and for Jason Garrett as good as it gets to turn around and watch all these people leaving this building right in the middle of the field right there loose quarter he is one of the most athletic linebackers there is say not as instinctive as Anthony Hitchens but that takes care of that and all the stuff about the eight nades and you can't have a winning record and you can't win the big games and all that stuff here's out the window right now it's a nice handshake the air from Scotland a hand a couple of kneel downs will end the game next week it's Indianapolis at home and then on the road and we'll try to look for a road sweep at Washington the final week Philadelphia meanwhile goes to Washington on the train next week and then to the Giants on the bus the following week but this brings everything back into play for the Dallas Cowboys yep you know they have a win in hand against the hottest team probably in football in Seattle or at least they look like that and this is a team now that you have to recalculate everything that you were thinking about the playoffs going forward because most people would have assumed after Thanksgiving in the way that the Eagles now playing at home look at the Dallas Cowboys sitting on top there they are Tony Romo of course has done the job Nick Foles is gonna go for an xray tomorrow to take a look at his left shoulder the non throwing shoulder don't know when he can come back first of all he's gotta get the X ray has to look better than it has the last time they took one can have to see that it's heal and then who knows about Falls and when when or if Falls can come back before the end of the regular season or into the playoffs if the Eagles get there so that's gonna do it we go from 21nothing Dallas to 24 21 Philadelphia to a final score of 38 to 27 cowboys dez bryant with three touchdown receptions the Marco Murray goes in for two scores Romo throws for 265 three TVs no picks Bryan has a great night six catches for 114 Fletcher has a pretty bad night 3827 the final score coming up next the Volkswagen postgame report these messages from your NBC station",

  "transcript": "fireworks go off and we are set for what we think is going to be a heck of a game and it's the president on a near windless night with the ball being blown off the tee he'll figure they got a riku the fireworks talents there the whole thing I did the wind at the moment I'm just looking at the wind machine it's at three miles an hour a second to go so maybe that's the norm of who knows and once again after one false start Bayley sends it down for the potty and it's been about at the 17yard line the ball is loose the Cowboys are there at the 17 yard line Terry McCauley is the referee some miscommunication there because Huff was coming up to take it but the up back looked around expecting Huff to live ball it's a lie he's just like an onside kick it doesn't matter we're on the field that is the Cowboys ball if they're on it and they are I don't know if he just missed the kick but it was well short and none of the up backs even seemed to react to it Brad Smith was right there and he just puffed just couldn't get up to it in time it's on the ground and now it is just a freeforall down there and CJ Stillman comes up with it bran Smith is a guy who's run back a lot of kicks in his career we used to play with the Jets but he moved forward looking to block Huff came up from the goal line and couldn't handle it Stillman winds up with the football the Cowboys get a huge break right off the bat as they have a first down at the 18yard line clearly huh but that Brad Smith has gone up to catch the boy you could see Huff relaxed thinking that Smith was going to get it and now Tony Romo who probably has had that injection and his back about thirty minutes ago is out there ready to go ah dirty here is that the Eagles have one of the best special teams groups in the National Football League but a big mistake right off the bat so I have to Philadelphia okay 14:55 if philadelphia elects to receive it also means that dallas has a short field Dallas will get the second half kick go up so a nearperfect start right now for the Cowboys we'll see if they cash in Thanksgiving it was the Eagles who got off to the great start and now the Cowboys will an opportunity DeMarco Murray leads the league in rushing he is the running back play fake Romo what's downfield as coverage because it's way out of bounds as we take a look right now at the Dallas starters Tony Romo Eastern Illinois University DeMarco Murray Oklahoma Dez Bryant Oklahoma State Terrance Williams bailiff Jason Witten Tennessee James Hannah Oklahoma Tara Smith you'll see Ron Alou University minute Travis Frederick Wisconsin Zack Martin Notre Dame dug through Northern Illinois University pop on the sideline front of shake it off is the cowboy offense comes up second down and 10 play clock down to three and we give it to marine forced out of bounds after a pickup of five yards by Cedric Thornton Tony Romo owns an NFL record he's on the touchdown pass in 39 consecutive road games so you play 80year that means over the last five years he's thrown one and every game on the road this year 15 touchdowns one interception all their issues have been at home Cowboys NASA and three receivers to the left Romo out on a shotgun on a third and six from the 14 good protection pants pork that'll be a first down Terrence Williams takes it to the six yard line Carey Williams the cornerback makes the stop it will be first down and goal for Dallas just a little slant across the middle here and it has been Williams who has not been much of a factor had six touchdowns early in the year but really not doing much lately and right off the bat at least initially this offensive line with good protection he has seen less action cold Beasley has seen more its first and goal from the 6 Marie and Murray taking the Eagles with him all the way down to the oneyard line Murray on bass were close to a two thousand yard season he's almost a cinch right now to win the rushing title he's way out in front say a guy who's been playing really well lately is Doug free he had a broken foot missed a few games but now he and Jason Witten they're just moving the pile down towards the oneyard line trying to make an early statement with this offensive line second and goal watches the fullback Murray hazard after initial contact able to thrust Ward and get into the end zone for a Cowboys touchdown so the miss clay and you can see Hough saying my fault it's on me he gave up the ball in the Cowboys cache in going 18 yards exact Martin and they're taking care of Benny Logan and then the fullback klux able to just clean up after that but I tell you for the Dallas Cowboys the way they were embarrassed the hot start you could tell that Chip Kelly one to get his offense on the field and see if he could do it again in this game and instead the tables are completely turned now Bailey for the point after and 214 into the game takes the blame now boys go into the store and leads seven to nothing Sunday Night Football brought to you by Southwest Airlines look your low fare now at Southwest comm 5 Verizon get the bit more with our besties this holiday season by the allnew Kia Sedona and by Bud Light stand the game and drink responsibly earlier this week there is more hosted their annual holiday party for locals for dealing his family hardships took over as the quarterback when nick foles went down and early November now puffed back there again and again Bailey a bashing ball scooped up by huff and the garbage is good is it's taken out of bounds by Barry Church and let's take a look at the Philly offense Mark Sanchez Southern Cal with sharp Okoye Pitt Panthers Jeremy Maclin Mizzou Tigers Riley Cooper Florida Jordan Matthews Vanderbilt burn SELEX Cincinnati Jason Peters Arkansas Evan Mathis Alabama Jason Kelsey Cincinnati Andrew Gardner Georgia Tech Wayne Johnson Oklahoma so the Eagles of course go no huddle and fast pace and no running plays at a quicker pace and any team in history start from the 22 yard line bottled up as he reaches the line of scrimmage so put the clock in time to the next play they normally run a play in about 22 seconds second down and 10 is when they snap work but before they even snap it you've got a false start here all start offense number 71 fiveyard penalty second down jordan matthews moved they called that one on Jason Peters they're both moving forward Mark Sanchez now since he took over for the injured falls tenth Edie's 62% 88 and waiting as a victory over Dallas on Thanksgiving Day the 21 yard line that Bose was Shawn McCoy LeSean McCoy last year was the rushing champion so he won the title at DeMarco Murray figures to win this year the average did McCoy 5.1 yards per carry last year but only four point one this season a third down and 12 from the 20 and then that pass is incomplete intended for McCoy so about his raggedass start as you could possibly have box the kickoff let the Cowboys go in for a touchdown and then a very quick three announce well and that's the key because they're coming off a game against Seattle in which they had a hundred and thirty nine yards of total offense 82 yards passing both the lowest ever in the Chip Kelly era and now they turn around and start the game this way this time and now they are taking their punt returner out Chris Harris is going down because there was an empty slot over there with nobody guarding him so nobody's going to feel this putt and Donnie Jones will send it down he goes but bow shoes twentyone more yards down to the 12 yard line it's a 69 yard kick 7 nothing Dallas miss a moment of Sunday Night Football with NBC Sports live extra kicked the game with you anywhere online and on tablet downtown Philadelphia on this middecember Sunday night in temperature of 44 and for that 69 yard pot that bounced 21 yards for the 12 yard line Tony Romo under CEQA Murray over the right side gained three Barwon makes the tackle we go back to the punch see what happens right up here is Josh Huff and Dwayne Harris had to come down and cover him for fear that they would just take the ball and throw it right there so there's no punt return in the middle of the field and ultimately it costs the Cowboys probably 20 25 yards of field position not a bad play by Harris he was just didn't want to give up the free shot down the bow second and seven Hannah the tight end in lotion and all over the left side and just go written covered by Hamlin pressure put on by poll let's take a look at that Philadelphia's defense says if Jordan southern Marcus our universe beanie Logan Louisiana State University Fletcher cause Mississippi State counter Barwon Cincinnati Casey Matthews University of Oregon Michael Kendricks cap from Cole systematic Bradley pleasure Nate Allen University of South Florida knocking jinking the Ohio State University Terry Williams walk third and seven now from the 15yard line Romo over the middle to Whitney and went out to the 36 yard line they've been doing that for both of their careers 21yard gain their little double coverage out on Dez Bryant leaving Jason Witten wide open in the middle of the field they're working against Nate Allen here's a good matchup on the outside you've got Trent Kohler going against tyrant Smith but for Tony Romo to come out and get out of the hole created by the mistake on special teams it's a huge difference now for this offense and converted on a third and seven the ball now from the 36 yard line good protection again to the outside Tipton almost picked the pass intended for Dwayne Harris Terry Williams comes up to deflect it away second to ten ordinarily you'll see this guy carry Williams and a lot of man coverage but usually in bumpandrun this time he just read the route of Harris perfectly and that's awfully lucky for the Cowboys that wasn't a pick six you have better be careful out there with Kerry Williams very aggressive very physical now matched up against Dez Bryant who is equally physical Williams almost always lines up on the right side flexor lines up on the other side Brian can go either way this time it's Bryant against Williams at the bottom Murray finds a little bit of a hole gets to the 41 Jenkins makes the tackle so Murray of course has always been tremendously talented great college career at Oklahoma drafted in the third round and one of the reasons maybe he's playing better than ever will probably be the rushing champ is the fact that they've rebuilt that offensive line through the draft over the years and he's been able to take full advantage of that averaging over five yards per carry this season thirtyfive they send five and the pass is caught by Witten again over the middle so Philadelphia took Witten out of the game in Texas over Thanksgiving Day one catch for eight yards and tonight he's already caught two for 38 that's good for 17 in the first down check out tired Smith number 77 on the outside takes out two of the best pass rushers that Philadelphia has Conner bar went in at Trent Cole on the same play and for Jason Witten whose numbers have been down as a receiver last few weeks he's off to a hot start giggles oklets they run it to the left side again there goes Murray and he picks up nine he's taken down by Casey Matthews just short of a Dallas first downs one of the things the Eagles want to be able to do is with their interior three Fletcher Cox Vinny Logan and Cedric Thornton is sort of create walls in here they do not want anybody running in there and that is exactly what happened to the Cowboys last time this time a much more aggressive approach getting to the outside Tyrone Smith nice job blocking and the cut back lanes are created at that point now the backup back Lance Dunbar comes into the game on second and one and that's Dunbar with the ball and he'll be able to pick up the first down moving into the 30 so with Tony Romo we all know about these two small fractures and his backtoback surgeries over the past year and a half is tough as they come missed one game against Arizona then played in London had a bye week going into the Giants game on a Sunday night which they won but then only three days dressed before the Thanksgiving game he wasn't right the team wasn't right but now he comes in here Chris on 10 days rest yeah you could watch the tape of that game and just see the heat cook nail didn't take his usual shot to give him some mobility and it showed Dunbar stays in the game they fake on the indoor just dumps it at the feet and completed will be second down and ten one of the things that Romo wanted to try and get done in this game is yes they're going to be a first and second down run team they've been that all season long and that has been who they are but his feeling was you got to take some shots on early downs too that's when the passing lanes are the most open so let's not be so predictable let's make some plays down the field but so far those first down shots haven't been there he's been getting the gun on Thursday and in using Murray's ass a lot on first and second and he's had fewer third and shorts than any team in the league puts you in a position to have a third 233 and now more and he spins around and that's exactly what he will do here go set you up with a third and two in the Nate yard gain on second down one of the things that the Philadelphia Eagles like to do with their linebackers Casey Matthews and Michael Kendrick says have them be very patient behind that front three line and there you saw him sort of sitting back and waiting and then when they see Murray come through there then exploded go get them but you have to make the tackle so far they've been missing the open tackles in space the maria's 7yard gain spotted at the 23 another third down for Dallas the Cowboys are three of three on third down to this point q and that's Witten who will have the first down so he makes his third catch of the game needed three got for first now Cowboys it's a little bit interesting and that the Philadelphia Eagle has really thought that the Cowboys offense was changing a little bit they were asking Jason Witten to block so much that he was more of a safety valve in other words blocked and then escaped late and yet here early in this biggest game of the year it has been the Jason Witten show under six minutes to play in the opening quarter down the suntimes 7nothing Murray to the outside can you get around for he does for a gain of about four Cowboys made a change in the offseason Bill Callahan have been calling the plays a year before it had been Garrett they go to Scott Linehan former head coach of the Rams and then he went to Detroit where he was known as the passing display caller in the lead I asked if I said is it a little hard to call these runs he said it's a little unnatural I've got to admit that he said but this is what we do best we are built around this offensive line a DeMarco Murray so we're staying with it second and five Lori's already gained 39 yards on the ground tonight the outside little pine but easily makes the catch well he's really come on covered there by Jenkins and Cole Beasley will set up a first and goal from the seven yard line boy what a matchup this is right here Zack Martin the outstanding right guard draft choice Fletcher Cox who has been proven to be just a terror against the run and not bad as the pass rusher either a lot of people think Fletcher Cox has been the best defensive line going in Zack Martin the Dallas Cowboy he's got a right with that pen this will be the 14th play of a drive that started at the Dallas 12 we get stuff Fletcher on cue Chris here's the problem you've got is that Fletcher Cox is so thick he can go through you but he can also go around you here Zack Martin sets up and thinks he has him thinned out and then he just whips right around the Fletcher Cox only has three sacks but he has a lot of hurries and because of their style of play it's not a pass rushing style so statistic he's not going to have big numbers and his the Eagles put anybody plays against him they vote and the bunch of taxes will lost that one right there two second down and goal Cowboys five wide wrong all the time wait for somebody to get open nobody can get open secondary says it's work it'll be third down and goal tried to get it to des Bryan in the back of the end zone but when des step back he got pushed out of bounds so Tony Romo despite the fact that he had all this time to throw the back left in zone as Brian's out a pound and it's no longer an eligible receiver tried to peel back on Carrie Williams who shoved him out of bounds and no flag no foul and now we have a flame and well after the play the field jokes came in through a fast eliwood contact defense number 26 yeah that's right and Chip Kelly saying why you throw a flag five seconds after the play is over all right here we go right up here right before the pass he shoves him out of bounds obviously more than five yards down the field illegal contact properly called relatedly call but properly called and the crowd booing music took about five seconds for that flag to come out we were in the replay when the flag was thrown and it sets the Cowboys up with the first time to go at the 4 yard line they've had seven runs and seven passes this is play 15 of the drive Murray to bring them down in the three yard line second down and goal for Dallas you know it's it's going to be very tough to get movement from Benny Logan and Cedric Thornton and Fletcher Cox inside their job is to hit make contact extend their arms like a bench press and sit there and watch and see does he go to the right or left and then shed that time you saw Benny Logan do it perfectly game is 11 and a half minutes old and Alice's had the ball for 10 minutes second ago no running back got a pass that des brilliant will haul in for a touchdown over Bradley Fletcher so they go 88 yards 16 plays in 8 minutes and 16 seconds what's the arm extension here but no real push I think the official was looking closely his arms got extended but there was no real push that came out of it so they let that one go so a few close calls here that go to the Cowboys way butcher the guy who gets picked on most and a Philadelphia secondary Bailey for the extra point and the Dallas Cowboys have come roaring into Pennsylvania late the first quarter and lead 14 to nothing Jimmy Fallon in town in New York all week long with a good lineup of guesting Frankel the coming by you'll also see Ben Stiller against this week on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon on NBC well Jerry Jones is right there Steven Jones his son his daughter Charlotte Frankham Dean Jones his wife sitting one well behind some different formation tonight for luck I guess and so far it's paid off they never made it yet right from the oneyard his branch Smith who runs it back and gets taken out nice tackle by Hanna before he reaches the 20yard line so the Eagles have the wolf only the second time and trail 14 others Rod Marinelli the defensive coordinator was on the staff last year Monte Kiffin was the DC that Mommy weaves upstairs and rods defense they created a three and I his team now has a 14 to nothing lead and let's see what the Eagles can generate now beginning from the 20yard line Sanchez hands the ball to McCoy and he gets swallowed up before he gets to the line of scrimmage all over him right there number 96 Hayden McClaine comes in as well boys been a big difference to that defense it'll be second down and 11 for this defense he's playing so much more discipline put ball tonight taken down at the point where that is Rolando McLean making the tackle from behind again they go at warp speed but they need a first end at defense their defense isn't on the field the whole game this is a huge play what we saw against Seattle for Philadelphia if they don't make first downs on the first three plays that they have they're in trouble Darren Sproles is in the game he's going to get sack of the 16 yard line though a nightmare start mcclain and Jeremy Mincey converge and that six plays in less than two minutes and they got a punt again little cross right here and go through and remember the Dallas Cowboys only have now 20 sacks on the year compared to the Eagles at 44 so a bit stunning there but they catch him with a blitz and they win bounty Jonas with a wobbly kick fielded before by Dwayne Harris and he gets tackled immediately as a flag down on the play you know how it was interesting and if you brought that up to Jason Garrett that his team doesn't blitz very much last night on third and medium there we were in the first real third and medium what they do they blitz and they come up with a sack yeah I mentioned to him last night you guys only blitz on third and medium we got penalty here against Philadelphia now I'm gonna see if Garrett wants to decline it I said you're only blitzing 7% of the time the league average is 40% he said I didn't realize it was that severe you're clear curtain oh my go I like it we're going about Valens on his own on a pot kicking team number 11 fiveyard penalty out of the end of the play first down timeout kind of leaves on half a minute they have to go in the quarter 14 to nothing Jason Garrett has watched his team be perfect on the road to season 6 on the 32.2 points a game only Indies scoring more per game on the road and look at Tony's numbers 15 touchdowns one interception on the road this season and DeMarco Murray has been great home or Road on 30 yards per game only Arian Foster of the Texans week more Road yardage so they start now Joseph Randle starts at running back from the 44 yard lines and he's a number three guy who seemed Dunbar Lisa Marie and he gets stopped at the 43 you know we see it so often Chrissie it's two teams meet and and people say 17 days ago Philly kill them so they're gonna kill them again but this is the NFL you never know what's gonna happen Cleveland Cincinnati the exact same thing Cleveland comes with Cincinnati knocks them off big Cincinnati returns the favor going back the other way so there is no such thing anybody tells you they know what's happening in NFL just laugh out by a nose anybody know anyone second down and 11 but it's fun to talk about it anyway it's 43 no running backs you go 5 wide here vanish spreading it out threeman rush makes the catch that's a first down takes it to the 44 yard line under a minute to play now in the quarter I'm really surprised to see the Eagles with this threeman rush just these three guys and we've already seen Romo just thin they're basically in the pocket and and I gotcha but this is the team that really has been build around man coverage they even have good nickelanddime guys Brandon Boykin very good six interceptions a year ago Nolan Carroll they have the ability to play man across the board so far though it hasn't been the case and you shouldn't fall into the moment on the sidelines ramble is in the backfield they flare him out well over the pump a comes back the other way throughout the past was incomplete intended to fly crowd wants an intentional grounding Paul who's Macaulay but he was ready to open up his mic dez bryant basically wheeled and was going up the field Romo threw it outside think it would have been intentional grounding when i first looked at it but his crowds getting a little restless and well they should don't take anything way Blanca to run a draw rainbow Joseph Randle to the 30yard line given a lot of talent drafted in the fifth round out of Oklahoma State that's a first down and that takes us to the end of the quarter totally dominated by the Dallas Cowboys 14 demethylases floor and Sunday night picked off the Philly back after this tonight's aerial coverage is being brought to you by Geico Philadelphia Al Michaels christanja to show the glory of Sunday Night Football we could feed 14nothing Dallas and the Cowboys on a first down here Murray that's his 11th Theriot the game to the 25 so how did things start tonight here's a look back look at Brad Smith on this one the up back prays they're pointing to Josh back at the end zone basically saying that fall is jurors and Josh Huff said are you kidding me that thing's 30 yards away it's not like the old days where I'm staying on the goal line I am ten yards back there and he knew he couldn't get there and he was anticipating Brad Smith look it was not a typo under 32 yards 20 flag is thrown here buried to the outside he gets taken down by the safety Malcolm Jenkins penalty is against Dallas second down that's what let's go to Michelle well Eagles linebacker Casey Matthews collided with teammate Nolan Carroll a few plays ago he went to the bench had a brief conversation with the medical staff on the sidelines and then eventually went to the locker room without his helmet he's being evaluated for a head injury out all right Thank You Michelle that's a manual option number 51 thirdyear guy out of Texas came over to trade with Cleveland and it's significant because D'Amico Ryan's was there there he got hurt so Casey Matthews came in boats were the signal callers now they're threedeep in that position here's Beasley and easily takes it to the 25 yard line that's five yards short of the first Boykin makes the tackle and sets them up for a third down and five and the Cowboys are four for four on third down tonight now Dez Bryant pretty good receiver but on these quick screens he's almost more valuable as a blocker because he's big and he's strong and then you can allow for Beasley to run the football behind him number one on the league on third down we mentioned before when you got a guy like Murray he sets you up in a lot of third and shorts right now they or whistle before the snap he's been acting up front Byron Smith the Cowboys fall for fiveyard penalty her down so two penalties on the series year and it's third down and ten now and it's significant because they're at that longrange field goal range here so we certainly don't want any part of the sack here you don't make sure you get this three part point opportunity out of it with five wide and he does it again play clock on the fire and this time they get to him at the 38yard what your toxins another flag that came in at the end of the play just after the play flag in the secondary down of the 23 yard line a huge pause defense it's the first down if not they're out of field goal range contact defense number 27 that's Carrie Williams that turns a fourth and 18 and out of field goal range into a first down carry Williams wants to be physical it's his nature he's very good at it unfortunately in this game thus far that's legal that's legal wouldn't she get down the field they're gonna say that's illegal and here's a guy that's fired up you're playing in a big game you want to get after people and the rules are not going to allow him to do it that's his second penalty first down at the 25yard line more conventional said Marie to the short side of the field runs out a loom at the line of scrimmage one inch is there that make a second out of ten well in the three games that Chip Kelly has had coached in this series two in one record against Romo only one touchdown has Tony thrown with four picks coming in and they limited Murray to a very pedestrian three point three yards for Carrie Davis the defensive coordinator but tonight 141 yards to nothing so far for the Dallas Cowboys who have owned the football and now before second down our 10 first timeout they have play clock rolling down Dallas will take a timeout three minutes into the second quarter now you've got Matthews coming back to the bench so a good sign is he obviously had to be cleared back there it's kind of a remarkable story isn't it about Tony Romo and what he has to do to get that back ready he goes out for pregame warmup and then goes back into the locker room and he gets an injection at that point in his back he said it takes about 30 minutes for it to kick in but can you imagine he was describing it and obviously if you've been through some of those procedures they put the needle in and then they sort of twist it around and they're different angles and Tony said the guy does like playbyplay on it he says right we're going here and we're gonna do the sets I don't need to know just expose it stop it is faster Ranieri he lost today at Buffalo we'll figure that one out Roma would be number two its second down and ten went deep and there's Bryant touchdown Dez Bryant it's free down the sideline for the touchdown when you're in bump and run coverage it all happens at the line of scrimmage you win or you lose at the line of scrimmage right there Bradley Fletcher does not get his hands on Dez Bryant then hesitates at the top end of that route protection was rocksolid their guy with a bad back you don't want to see him on his back and so far tonight this offensive lines been pretty good they go Fletcher's way again six more points make it seven Bailey for the extra point 26 yards second touchdown and the Dallas Cowboys are up by three touchdowns Sunday night football being brought to you by Microsoft Surface the official tablet of the NFL by Pepsi hype your hometown with Pepsi Pepsi calm my mercedesbenz experience to the greatest merit today at your authorized dealer by American sniper and select either December 25th everywhere On January the 16 series terminal parking Fury stole it off of the Reading Terminal Market teach me to read the card before I say anything Nick Foles who was the starting quarterback until he broke his collarbone in Houston on the sidelines and the wait to see when he's ready to come back watch is the first guy to hit him he's down on the run back at the moment out of bounds at the 26yard line during the return holding the city team number 23 10yard penalty first down so it falls out Mark Sanchez and you know about Mara number of years with the Jets elected fifth overall in 2009 here San Jose he was known there started the AFC championship games is a rookie and a secondyear guy he won four playoff games then he missed the entire 2013 trees in with a shoulder injury bring it to as the Eagles starting quarterback they let him go in March he signs here till they let Mike Vick go and he signed with the Jets and here Sanchez one career win and trailing by 14 or more who actually did that game and he walls to his left and throws and at least they get something zero net yards to this point as Selleck makes the catch and it's a gain of about five Sanchez played very well in the first Dallas game he had 24 29 217 102 rating everything was great in that one and he slings it to the left side that's juggled and no Riley Cooper did not have control of it sterling wore covering on the plane complete and will be third down and five in Philadelphia is on the cusp right now of a third consecutive three and out yeah and I know Chip Kelly doesn't care about time of possession but when it's 15 minutes the three minutes that's a bit of a problem and you keep going three and out it's a real problem Sanchez brings Selig into the backfield as protection he stays in the block is marvel at the time he throws and they finally get a first half as Scholz makes the catch this grows flares that the former charger and sink first year here Hitchens makes the stop first down if there's Darren Sproles you just wonder how much the Doral and Saints missed that guy we were talking to Philip Rivers in San Diego and I said you think they miss him a little bit he said they miss him I miss him in San Diego we're talking about rivers and Brees can commiserate in the 32 play action that by Sanchez a ton of time and in the past is a little high South could blow it in the rookie out of Oregon we therefore tip Billy Boy they had that they're gonna bootleg this way and throw back that way and it's wide open this can't miss this one this is a great play design freebie second 10 inside Avon strolls burrows to the 35 yard line third and long 3rd down and 7 now for Philadelphia Mark Sanchez said he'd never run the read option in his life before he got here and coach Kelly keeps telling me how easy it is it's not easy because the back doesn't know if he's going to get the ball or not they ran it over 30 times and that win and Thanksgiving over the Cowboys here comes the Blitz Saints his hangs in there fires caught first down sell it over the middle too tight lose the ball into Dallas territory to the 42 yard line autozone defense out of the Cowboys and Selleck just gets right in the middle that's a throw Sanchez day today Orlando Scandrick is down on the field one of the that people do whether this is the case here or not when an offense gets going have an injury the real or otherwise slow down the pace does it cost you a timeout and of course the crab knowing what's going on welcome there Scandrick so does he get hurt who knows it's you know it's a hand it's not like okay I'm I guess it's not going to be the fourth quarter but here no no good baby you know no I'm saying 60/40 12% okay 1288 from the 42 yard line and McCoy takes you to the 29 stop there by JJ Wilcox into the first down this is one of those what Sanchez go left back right and then scrolls goes back left again er LeSean McCoy on now and that issues in the past and continues and now you're getting McCoy going and this is what happened the last time it was but boy who got going and then the bootlegs in the play action off of that whale he snapped this one 12 seconds after very he's gonna get stuffed and now a third down and short coming up well that's one of those read options maybe Mark Sanchez should have kept let's see what happens if he holds on to this one right here so there's a late flag here at the 23 yard line would be pending a third down and two meanwhile offense number 18 defense number 39 fouls are set third down Macklin car and good good news of course the Scandrick didn't need to be hospitalized he's back in the game that's is very good news and there is Macklin down the field and car that's right at the 5 yards and said that's fine they're down at two Sanchez that though and that's a first down flag is from however is that first the number two tight end takes the ball with a fiveyard line flag is down at the 10 yard line on the other side there's the pond first that that's random car so backtoback fouls on him here's the read option pass now they come over and Mark Sanchez is not going to run this one he's going to throw it that is an alternative option and one really that Nick Foles does more of because he's not quite the runner that even Sanchez is now they're starting to look like the Philadelphia Eagles a little bit this will be the 11th play of a drive four runs six passes started back at their own 16 but this pulk in the game in the backfield and is going to take it into the end Chris Paul for the touchdown block hereby heaven man after the knee injury watch this one right here come out secure the first one take out Rolando McClain walk in touchdown for Chris Pole so one thing about the Philadelphia Eagles you ain't over that they can't score in a hurry and this Cowboys defense dude we're working 30 parking for the extra point they go 84 yards it only takes in 3 minutes and 24 seconds to get back in the game 21 7 Cowboys 7 New Year's Day celebrate one of the great traditions now in hockey the Blackhawks and the Capitals take it outside at Nationals Park in Washington and a cold winter threesome you see if you use day at one o'clock Chicago and a walk you see going on down by the diner ready football and four yards beep breaks the tackle and gets hogtied at the 27 yard line where the offensive line has done such a great job protecting Romo and Murray so they get a little bit of loan so he sends him boldly Vuitton travel bags better than that they get guests to bring told the love everything something yeah boy the offense was live and work is sending the air jordans iMac computers DeMarco Murray good to be an offensive London except when the referee says holding number 72 they have been terrific then combined with DeMarco Murray it's not a fastfood the Philadelphia Eagles have the fast offensive line athletic this is much more of a Power Group in the and sets up as the tight end on the right side 27 yard line carries to the 13 car c\u00e9dric number 72 comes up with the ball but the play is dead we go to my shelf hey Ally ask Tyron Smith about those gifts starting with the shoes from Dez Bryant he said everyone loves Jordans he called the Louis Vuitton travel bags from Romo quote really useful and he sent one DeMarco Murray gave them the IMAX he thought wow he's really looking out for us good to be the best my offensive line of these days B's that was such a a problem area for them over the past few years where they went to the draft of the Frederick and Tyron smoothly another in the elite category second to me that's caught for a first down by Winton forward progress will let him the first and Witten will be caught one more than the Thanksgiving Day game is now for for tonight for 51 yards and the matchup starting to be favorable now they're able to work against Casey Matthews inside and the veteran Jason Witten is just sort of working the middle of the field and obviously Matthews had to go out for a period of time but if they can get matched up on that other linebacker Michael Kendricks very athletic Tamiko Ryan's was a great leader in their that coverage wise that's the weakness for Matthews and man watching they were a witness catches tonight was open in the first now and to the 41yard line goes maria tackle there by kendra channel murray he's gonna break image this record unless he gets hurt cowboy records he's on the pace to get two thousand yards he'd need three phenomenal games about 160 plus per game to beat Eric Dickerson smart averages five yards to carry big anova has a huge night tonight already has 47 yards next week Indianapolis a team that gave up 200 to Joan display against them in the last game is against Washington who knows second and six at the Lance Dunbar and Dunbar spinning around close to a first down really it's really started with these two in here and some of their combination blocks Travis Frederick a big strong guy we saw it last week in the Bears game just driving off the ball together but those two young players very bright guys able to work together they haven't made the big mistakes that young players tend to make knickers Tyron smith the hammer with the left tackle position the one to watch tonight where they had the issue in the last game is Ronald bunch of hawks inside see if they keep trying to get that match up normal has to take a timeout because that play clock was down to one so television the bench stirred down in one when we come back to the left a front right is Jeffrey Lurie the owner of the team this is luring Tina to removed and in the middle is Bradley Cooper with the Eagles cap huge thought of Avenger McDonough so yesterday Cooper will call from Europe wherever he is catches every Eva's game but tonight to this point I see the Eagles could get off the field five one year wall mode to play fake and Ramos gonna go down at the 43 yard line we've come into the sack and that'll be 14 and a half sacks for far away first the coverage down the field try to go a little double move from Dez Bryant but it is the guy with now 14 and a half sacks on the season Connor Barwon who comes in and makes another huge play and it looks like the momentum is starting to shift a little bit back towards the Eagles here first I've had held the Cowboys have been held on third down Chris Jones we'll be spotted out of a short kick 30 yard building with the ball down by 14 this is what Chip Kelly did in Oregon bring that fastpaced offense here since he took over 23 and a half seconds to play fastest in the lead 20 or more yards on plays 160 that's the top rushing yards per game second points per game for it so they went to Eugene Oregon got Kelly after Ian recently said even want the job and he came back thought about it again and time for the NFL second year in the league and the shoes his offense trying to get boy dances around with glugging the uarter to bury church comes up to make the stop and back they come to the line of scrimmage as quickly as they can and the question is always can they get the first first down they had an all night didn't have anything going get one first down to start that last drive and go right down the field second to knee to the outside back to the good place thinking and authority for a first night Zach Ertz and that gets the crowd excited everybody knows what's going to happen when the tight end catches the ball the cornerback is not big he's going to go after his knee so more and more of these tight ends are going will Skeets Nehemiah Macklin makes and Nachman their number one receiver having a career year and that's the first cash for him tonight actually has better numbers than does Dez Bryant but who would have calculated that each at ten touchdowns the cowboy 49 and he gets taken down to make the stock gain of seven second and three say this offensive line is getting going they are so excited to have Jason Kelsey and Evan Mathis back in the lineup LeSean McCoy telling us we can do without anybody but Jason Kelsey the center is the brains of the operation and he pulls better than any Center the playing football second and three boy again swings to the outside McClain can't stop him he gets around the corner and picks up the first down melanda mcclain if he has an issue that they have been working on is he can't tackle high every time he's a tall guy and he wants to go up there make those tackles and that's when he misses the domain of sixfour exposed its tripped up by the plane number 97 the Roma claim second down well Terrell MacLean inside and they felt the one advantage they had on Jason Kelsey was they could put MacLean right on the nose of the center Kelsey and take advantage physically to this size 14 seconds in pass over the middle of silicon in down machine for a first down to the 26 yard line obviously the other advantage you have and you're going this pass on offense but now because Selleck is a bit banged up they make a substitution so the Cowboys puts up here and they would have held that snap right arch comes in right side line goes to the left foot goes to the and it's dropped by jordan matthews a rookie out of Vanderbilt second round draft choice little read option once again read option pass this time try and get it down the field and say it Jordan Matthews has had such a big year for this team missed an opportunity there what 56 passes this season second down and 10 now from the 26 yard line remaining in the set up a screen that schools can go nowhere pressure was on that time Bruce Carter winds up making the tackle and it's going to make it third down and 13 and will take us to the twominute warning another blitz there Orlando Scandrick coming hard off the slot a little more aggressive tonight at a Rod Marinelli two minutes to the hand 217 down the sights of the night before they're the halftime coming up Pass Broncos and gulfs punch the divisions the Seahawks win their fourth straight and I thought the 49ers Bob Costas Hines Ward way in on the first half coming up at halftime to me which sin is the sin though in the 29 now it's third and 13 Sanchez dump it out of bounds to extend to the play he bought time but it's fourth down and you'd be looking at about a forty six yard field goal here I don't know what Sanchez was doing there that was clearly another one of those sort of throwback plays they were going to try back to the other side he scrambled right and there wasn't one receiver on that half of the field so Kody parky a rookie picked up in a trade in preseason from the Colts where's college boy Auburn this is a 47yard attempt the 10 miles in parkis kick is just good inside the left

Pennsylvania Tony Romo ready to lead the Dallas Cowboys back out after they had a 21 nothing lead it's now turned into 21 to 10 from the 5yard line hours back of the tank see the coverage is great Chris precints key is there to make the tackle with 143 well there's a lot of conversation the Cowboys we're going to take a defensive player all three they wanted we're gone so they settled on Zach partners only turned out to be one of the top guards in all of football so far this season they're also full of conversations night event Johnny Manziel Maiden's debut as a starter today let it go so well so I think they were feeling pretty strong about Zach Partin who has completed this offensive line Lance Dunbar started running back Cowboys with 143 have already used to timeouts so one remains according their egos and would like love to see a three it out but here goes Dunbar Dunbar Gillison nice running so far tonight up to the 18 yard line making it second down and three you know Dunbar is a nice change of pace back usually used as a receiver more than a runner but there they saw backed up and entered in ball that's and take it out of the 29 yard line as Terrence Williams as important as anything was getting a few first downs and getting out of that hole you certainly didn't want to put that Eagles offense back out on the field again and you had a third down there he Philadelphia probably would have taken a timeout on defense can't think about that now you throw it underneath that is caught there by Lance Dunbar takes it out to the 35 yard line 52 seconds and tickin down Dallas conserving its final timeout we've seen this Dallas offensive long and on occasion gives Romo 6 7 8 seconds to throw the football makes the catch and beats the tries to get out of bounds and does at the 47 yard line to stop the clock with 33 seconds for Beasley three touchdowns in the last three games and really has opened up some opportunities maybe part of the reason the Jason Witten and Terrence Williams are catching more Vols Beasley in that slot has drawn a lot of attention now and now there's a little more balance across the board on who's getting the ball down the field numbers for Romo the 300 yard pace two touchdown passes both going Bryant's way and as queasily on Boyken out of the slide to Whitney he gets taken out of bounds that play only took four seconds it'll be second down and seven at the 50yard line here comes Kendricks right here up on the Blitz actually bring a couple of guys and Romo I'm not sure he could have done this on Thanksgiving what do you think Ali wasn't it his mobility was not at its best but now they're blitzing inside to see what happens when he moves been able to move just enough to get that completion and on three days rest without an injection that's for sure seven days left before the Chicago game pitching out ten days rest tonight second and seven those gone over the middle easily flag is thrown though bees so the flag stops the 22 seconds kind of leave second out it's a Doug free more the oldstyle Philadelphia Eagles defense here blank Benny curry way out here this old wide 9 and as Prairie tried to turn the corner it's a close call and sort of just pushed him down it almost looked like he was putting a little bit we've had a few close ones in here and no one went against the Cowboys so second down and 17 well out of field goal range here we do have a timeout then you get the second half kickoff the Cowboys will the Philly one across the third then watch the opening kickoff and depression sickness deep downfield and then throws out of bounds and the clock is stopped with 15 seconds all the matchups across the board Williams out there on des scramble brook girl starts there here's the coverage on Witten down the field and with through that hook out there to signal to his quarterback but really he wasn't open enough for Romo to move to his left and knit back around to make that conclusion third and 17 the other has that time axle to use threeman rush looking down the middle now running to top it off wash it down Williams is also down for the moment it's only about two or three yards past the line of scrimmage the line was the 40 if they decline the penalty you put Dallas into position where at least they're going to have to punt it illafford pass quarterback goes beyond the line number nine fiveyard penalty lost them down fourth down Philadelphia declines the tensecond run off down right to be is the tensecond one takes us to halftime this way at least they forced them in to a punt and here's the standard that back foot if it had gone on the line would have been legal plus we got Darren Sproles who is one of the top punt returners in all of football two touchdowns already and leads the NFL and punt return average so like guarantee he doesn't touch them I'm Dallas I just told Jones kick it out of bounds anywhere that'll take six seconds that's what they did the last time it wasn't much of a putt at least they didn't stick it to him Williams hobbles off where do you put a punt block on here rich massaging the special teams coach good one yep sure is then get it away schools just gonna let it bounce and that's going to bounce out of bounds and take us to his eye on the score Dallas 21 and Philadelphia 10 then we got next Dora messages from",

  "transcript": "exactly like I did Monday night he told me he said I stayed within myself I didn't force any sit thing said those were lessons I learned the hard way with the New York Jets one final thing Joe I asked him are you back in love with football he said I never fell in love out of love with the sport we just took a break and now it looks pretty good again if things are good and Philadelphia for Sanchez Park he's sweet as he kicked it away still an effective kick and not from inside the five it's Harris and he slips so obviously the footing is going to be a topic of discussion here today as both parky and then Diwan Harris lost his footing on the first play of the day here's Aaron Rodgers and the numbers for and Kern Rodgers especially here at home he's just almost impossible to stop he doesn't throw picks here at home it's been 12 straight games overall without an interception for Aaron Rodgers the League MVP in 2011 I think that's the most impressive part Joe is bigger guys he is in terms of big plays down the field the fact that he just does not make the mistakes he's got his man that's Jordy Nelson it's the 12th ranked offense in the NFL Aaron Rodgers with that quick trigger he is protected by a couple of banged up guards sitting and leg Lacey is the Maine back with Cobb and Nelson doing big things on the outside on second and and Randall Khan's got a first down so he goes to Nelson he goes to Cobb first down Green Bay as Carrie Williams made the stop for the 21st ranked defense in the NFL we highlight Casey Matthews because his big brother clay is in the stadium talk about clay certainly went green baize on defense first down Jordan Nelson Nelson down inside the ten they see the safety here in the middle of the field that's what the Packers wanted to come out and see how the Eagles were going to play them defensively single high safety means you've got one on one on the outside Bradley Fletcher trying to keep up with Jordy Nelson talked about it coming into this game this has been a big play offense that is the fifth play for Jordy Nelson of 50 yards or more on a reception big way to start this game just get it away Rodgers the direction of cob and Randall Cobb who's got six straight games with a touchdown catch can't make the reception back to Nelson now you see the speed that he has enabled that enables him to get in behind Fletcher he's got very deceiving speed he's a long Strider he makes up a lot of ground in a hurry but what a throw by Aaron Rodgers putting it out there just perfectly for Jordy Nelson try to do it five straight touchdown on their first possession go ventral 3:19 the negative on second and goal for Nelson when those back shoulder throws Bradley Fletcher and coverage its third and goal line but are the Philadelphia Eagles they like to bring a lot of pressure with different guys this time they bring the linebackers which they will do the Packers pick it up pretty well but it forces Aaron Rodgers to get the ball out of his hands quickly just a little off the mark for Jordy Nelson no doubt third down and goal Rogers and job incomplete feet were out of bounds its fourth down and a good stop by this Eagles defense as we take another look and by the time Nelson secures the catch he's out of bounds that was close if Nelson doesn't bobble the ball looks like he's going to be able to make that catch inbounds for the touchdown Aaron Rodgers does a great job keeping the play alive but the Eagles defense credit after the big reception by Nelson limiting the Packers here three times just getting it inside the right upright his Mason Crosby from 27 yards away good stop by the Eagles defense after a first and goal three says well it's an opening possession threepoint Drive on the 27 yard field goal by Mason Crosby found funny with penny Logan who was at the nose was being moved by the umpire prior to the snap watch this logan 96 he up parts trying to help him get lined up right Logan turns around talks to the umpire and then after shoving the guy in front of him goes back and talks to under II wash the umpire for today's game Logan saying he's got enough it's got enough things to worry about besides the umpire trying to move around well the umpires got enough things to worry about he's the guy that's got to spot the ball for this fastpaced high temple offense to the Eagles and Hulk on the return is out across the 20 out across the 25 where he's brought down by Brett Jones and here comes Mark Sanchez Troy were you blown away with the play of Mark Sanchez in last week's start against Carolina well Joe I think the thing that he did best was just not force throws I thought he came out early in that game had some opportunities you know was unable to take advantage of it but he settled in you would expect that the guy hadn't played hadn't started a game in a couple of years we'll see how he starts this ball game but that was key and it will be key again in this game because that's been really the rule negative for this offense has been their inability to hang on to the football they did that last week and that's always been the knock on Sanchez starting at the 26 a little shoulder fake and he comes back for Cooper Riley Cooper's got 11 yards of first down where he was popped by Morgan Burnett and here they are right at the line of scrimmage hardly time to catch your breath dr. McCoy and we shall a game where he was bottled up against Carolina only 19 yards on the ground is good for three Perry on the stop and here's the 5th ranked offense the Philadelphia Eagles well LeSean McCoy obviously not having the numbers that he had a year ago but I don't think he had slipped at all I think still have dynamic guys that just keeps it he's got Macklin it makes the catch where he's tapped down at the 40 by Mikah hide a 20yard completion and right back to the line go the Eagles they're actually running plays at a quicker clip with Sanchez at quarterback than they were with Nick Foles and Mark Sanchez says that's what he really loves about this offense that the place come in so quickly and if they attempt some time less allows Chip Kelly to give him some tips in his head set that is cut off with 15 seconds on the play clock it's worth going back to that you can talk to the quarterback with that transmitter helmet the receiver helmet from the sideline in this case Chip Kelly up until 15 seconds are left on the play clock so Chip Kelly can talk to Mark Sanchez while he's up in the line of scrimmage that he'll tell him if he likes a matchup on the outside with a particular receiver versus a coroner tell him if a blitz is coming on second down kengosan chance the arms at Latroy guy on he wasn't able to tell him the Latroy gaion was coming though Joey just beats his man there Matt Tobin the right guard excellent job just getting right in the face of Mark Sanchez and Sanchez got a helmet hit the sack back that gives him two and a half the last of seven third and 13 sanchez toward the side ridin complete four scrolls and after a promising start to their first drive on offense it stalls inside packard territory its fourth down that's a good job by Green Bay defensively you're right Philadelphia was starting to move the football coming up with some plays and guy on with the sack which essentially ends that drive for the Eagles now the dangerous Randall Cobb waits for the punt from Jones and just outside the 10 he hauls it in 32 yard punt Aaron Rodgers and the Packers with a football and a threepoint lead they just keep adding to this stadium that was just unveiled this week that 50 foot replica of the Lombardi Trophy and there's the hit by guy on checking in with my grenades that could have been called the helmet to helmet hit on that sag on Sanchez it's lacy first carry of the day many lacy gets to Michael Kendricks on the stuff in fact it probably should have been called by the rule Joe and that's one of the ones that I don't like is a quarterback when you're trying to duck or absorb the head makes it hard on these defensive linemen to know exactly where they're going to tackle the quarterback but by rule that should have been called ready ready took second and eight here's Lacey can he runs into a play it up club first get in there was penny Logan he's still mad talking to the umpire and loss of one on the play third long coming up this is an Eagles defense Joe that I think has really gotten better as the season has gone along especially here over the last four weeks I talked about the Packers wanting to know how the Eagles were going to play them they like to single up on the outside bring an extra guy down to help and run defense but this is a different kind of receiving for with Randall Cobb and Jordy Nelson but the Eagles have held true to what they do with one on one outside third down and nine Rogers out to his right pass is caught first slide on third and long a gain of 22 this tandem of Randall Cobb and Jordy Nelson is really something you see they clear outs on the sidelines with Jordy Nelson it opens things up then for Randall Cobb to design roll out by Aaron Rodgers the next one job of convert converting on third down rush boss 95.5 ready ready odds first down the lane and up and any Laci who carried for 1178 yards is a rookie with 11 touchdowns a packer rookie record a year ago not counted on as much so far in 2014 goes up the middle for three brought down by Kohl and Mike McCarthy was talking about you know the year that Eddie Lacy is having and his real improvements this year have come in pass protection which is always an area where young running backs struggled also used to find the screen game well protected over the millions got for us first poreless add to the 49yard line what's joke lat doing on this Sunday week 11 let's find out I'm watching this big matchup in the desert Joe Cardinals Lions battling for the top spot the AFC and it's drew stand with the first strike to Michael Floyd 42 yards 7 nothing cards Joe Troy and Erin great story is Stanton heartbreaking story is Carson Palmer but Stanton steps in and off to a good start they're firing it down the field by foot but Bruce Arians likes to do as his Bruce just happy to get on it that thing came back hot and a loss of 14 as it went off the hands from the rookies center Cory Linsley they see Cory Lindsley he's looking up at the big board trying to see exactly what happened it wasn't a bad snap don't know if it was coming in hot like you said Joe or no maybe Aaron Rodgers just takes his hand or his eyes off it but it gets buying they're fortunate they're able to get on it and not have it be a turnover they love this Center fifth round pick out of Ohio State Green 18 you know second in 24 24 all cob get out on the edge it's going to be third down and long and you said it this defense run by Bill Davis who really started his career in the NFL under Dom Capers and Bill Cowher with his Steelers Dom Capers the coordinator here in Green Bay they're just getting better and better they looked pretty good near the start now third down to 23 and quick I'm very light fire ready that we take heed when I get up that's a free place Oh air it out there's Nelson incomplete with a free play it's an offside on the defense and Trent Cole on the heart count offside number 58 defense fiveyard penalty repeat third down well that's a great job by Aaron Rodgers here at home being able to use the hard count you can hear it he tried it the first time and these quarterbacks have gotten so good at using the hard count a lot of different variations into how they use it Aaron Rodgers gets the free play takes the shot only picks up five yards here on third and long give them one more try so now third and 18 you have to get to the Philadelphia 41 and Greg's lead winning team big protection hit by Nate Allen with a gain of 24 on third and 18 well Andrew Corliss he's just a free release off the ball and he's able to go right through the middle of this defense without anybody picking him up in coverage three safety Nate Allen was the only guy to be able to come up and make the play on him you don't expect to convert those situations Rogers Jarrett Boykin with Carey Williams in coverage Boykin looking for bigger numbers this year he's got only two catches so far this season that's got to be disappointing for defensive coordinator Bill Davis third and 23 you jump offsides you manage that it's third and 18 and you give up a first down in 18 Jordy Nelson it's it's amazing here in Green Bay with a homefield advantage at the Packers have and there are over 78,000 people inside Lambeau Field and it is so quiet up but them on office you can hear everything from the line mr. Rogers the tight end richard rogers the third round pick he's been primarily a blocker here in his rookie season but they get a matchup that aaron rodgers likes he delivers a perfect strike and Aaron Rodgers is continuing this assault that he has been on now for the last four weeks already thrown for over 150 yards near the first down marker he's got a fresh set and he lowered his shoulder was pointed on the other end that's a big back 511 230 laying it into Brandon Boykin go check on Boykin we'll take a break on America's game of the week Packers up three kicked in the helmet and the face the left foot of Malcolm Jenkins they're going to take him in for further evaluation now its first and goal the ball at the Philadelphia six we ladies had some rocky Davante Adams see Davante Adams he runs the slant route there against Fletcher and does a nice job of running the round making the catch we'll see whether or not the ball breaks the plane looked like it does right there but Aaron Rodgers in visiting with him Joe he thought that this might be a game where Adams got a lot of opportunities because of the way that the Eagles play he's able to make the catch there they verify because it's a scoring play certainly look like he got it he did it's a touchdown he also said talking about Adams Aaron Rodgers it was not a good way to practice for Davante Adams might be hitting that rookie wall but Rodgers was gonna look for him coming into this game and he's found him for the first touchdown today 10 nothing Aaron Rodgers another touchdown pass here at Lambeau and the rookie takes the lead 10 nothing Packers on top there's a drive for the Packers who are wearing the jerseys and the colors and the hats of the 29 champion Acme Packers here in Green Bay first time Green Bay went to this throwback uniform was in 2010 10 nothing but Crosby set to kick it away in pulled wading deep Chris Paul from inside the 5 losting and it jumped right into the arms of Brad Smith Smith is there and that was a good bounce for the Philadelphia Eagles polecat it knocked out who's Boykin that knocked it out Smith was there to pick it up Eagles have it downtown second possession for the eagle Sanchez with three minutes 25 seconds left and they open starting from the 30th Nicole and the koi is brought down after a gain of three they were checking out the neck of Mark Sanchez after that hit he took the guy on the sideline they told Matt Barkley to get up start moving around but Sanchez bit enough to go back again coming up and a flag is thrown claim Matthews was the first guy there we haven't even in even dived into the fact that Matthews is now an inside line number 69 offense it's on Evan Mathis we haven't had time to talk about anything when the eagle's nest looks fast as they snap it but yeah that was a hold on Evan Mathis against Clay Matthews Clay Matthews playing inside linebacker in certain situations they unveiled it last week against Chicago as you see the hole up there by Evan madness and this guy plays downhill and he plays fast they have been better they were better last week against the run they've been good here in the early going a big part of that though has been because those big guys up front have gotten off blocks and penetrated in the bathroom see the back into all the numbers the Packers too it's third and six once Sanchez is sacked again it's Neal and the second on Sanchez the loss of nine its fourth down Eagle is going to run some quick caught crossing routes here balls got to come out pretty quick you see if he's able to get the ball immediately to Jordan Matthews there's an opportunity with nobody in the area great job getting off the ball once again by the Packer that was another hit to the head of Mark Sanchez this time by Neil Antron just inside the 25 it's Michael he's got the point touchdown no floods you're going to return a punt Joe you always got to make one guy miss Josh huh we're living on the field is it touchdown after the touchdown unsportsmanlike conduct they called an unsportsmanlike conduct Green Bay after the touchdown here's the mess Josh Huff was in position as he breaks down Mike the hide is able to make him miss which you have to be able to do if you're going to get big returns this special teams unit for the Eagles has been outstanding all season long but they give up a huge play there Micah Hyde 75 yard return after a 50yard punt the Eagles get a little taste of their own medicine they've been returned the football for one touchdown after another nine on the year but it's hide who takes it for 75 and another touchdown for the Packers here's the missed by huff seventyfive yards later Micah Hyde into the end zone and then here was the penalty with the group celebration that drew the flag so the Eagles should end up with decent field position after this kick look at what this Packers team has done over the last four home games in the opening quarter so explosive here at Lambeau Field and you get off to those kinds of starts it obviously makes it awfully tough then on your opponent the Eagles special teams as I've said they've been a real asset for this team all season long and they've been the ones scoring the touchdowns this time the Packers they get the big return for themselves my tent this is pole being backed up good starting field position for Philadelphia as Brad Jones makes this stop a 21 yard return not across the 40yard line college football matchup on fs1 this Thursday night big 12 showdown 13th ranked kstate taking on West Virginia begins at 7:00 Eastern on Fox Sports 1 and streaming live on Fox Sports go and the Eagles need to get something going here offensively to jump back in it I guess the good thing for the Eagles is it doesn't change what they do I mean they play fast tempo they're in the no huddle hurry up to even down 17 points it doesn't affect what they're going to do on offensively the poi with a nice gain of five yards Matthews on the tackle and he made the rookie haha : Dix Miss on that carry second and five middle Jordan trying to get the first down it looks like he got enough for it he did was good job there by Mark Sanchez Jordan Matthews was his third receiver on the progression he's able to work back to him very quickly be able to pick up that first down here's McCoy and McCoy picks up to Morgan Burnett on the tackle the switch was made with Clay Matthews going inside primarily to help the run defense it was better last week and what was a flow out win and are they going to be better gauged as to what happens here today it was better he led the team with 11 tackles in that game the like I said it wasn't just him there was a across the board second and eight setting up the screen Scrolls and scrolls for the first down near the 30 they're going to mark them at the 31 a catching run of 16 yards it's a good job of setting up the screen Evan Matt this gets just enough in order to free sprawls for a nice game Sanchez my cahide fresh off the punt return for the touchdown got a hand in front of jordan matthews to knock it away this Micah Hyde he's really been a good contributor to this team he moved to safety last year he got noticed in the preseason says he lays out and gets a hand on that ball got noticed in the preseason an outstanding Blitzer off the slot and he's also a very good tackler makes a nice play on the ball on second down McCoy out of the backfield good throw nice move and McCoy slips as he made the move around haha Quinton Dixon catch and run of 18 yards off to the second quarter we go and some will pet him down for the Eagles down 17 back after this from your local Fox station Philadelphia's now in the red zone this is where the Eagles and Sanchez in particular than very good Philadelphia with Sanchez at quarterback seven for seven in the red zone getting touchdowns side cuts upfield get some yard when dicks on the tackle the rookie who was the first round pick out of Alabama its second down and nine and we've seen Troy guys slipping we saw was shot McCoy the end of the first quarter so footing is an issue second down to nine there's braless blockers in front of him and Scrolls down near the five gaya of the tackle they will give him the fiveyard line a game at 7:30 short coming up that was a play that was off of the completion that they had earlier right before the end of this first quarter and then they come off of that with the screen on the backside and pick up a nice game to make up make this a manageable here third down they're down in two Sanchez down he goes and it's Matthews making the play set number three the idea on this play is that Clay Matthews is going to chase down the line of scrimmage on the backside run instead he comes up the field but Mark Sanchez when you come out on that play you have to check it immediately when you get the snap to see what that edge rusher is doing Matthews rushing up the field and Matt and excuse me Sanchez a little surprised when he came off of that fake but a good stop defensively parky hits his fourteenth in a row the rookie from Auburn it was traded to the Eagles from Indianapolis Matthews with another sack and it's a 17 to 3 game and lambo eagles are on the board now a 17 to 3 game it's just not that easy is it to switch positions at this point if you're Clay Matthews and going from the outside to the inside different angles a lot more traffic but ways made that transition look simple well because he's so versatile and such a great athlete you know that's why they make the move with him knowing that he was capable of making those adjustments as you just Archy almost slipped again on that kick that's all so now even though Green Bay is going to go back on offense and we'll watch Aaron Rodgers we'll also welcome you inside our broadcast booth what you see from Mark Sanchez the last time the Eagles had it yeah I think that was a good possession for mark I thought he was decisive on where he was going with the ball I thought Chip Kelly called some nice things it was a good chance for them to get started with the points on the board you know three points however it's not going to cut it against this Green Bay Packer team because of their explosiveness themselves offensively the key right now is for those Eagles defense they've got to come up with some stop Green 18 from the 20 toss to lacy the cross 225 again a six there's curtain men of favor the game break while Michael Floyd had two touchdown receptions all season and then got to the first court today against Detroit that 12 yarder put him up 14 nothing it's 14 3 right now Arizona on top in the battle for the best record in the league Jojo an understanding taking on his former organization a secondround pick in 2007 of the ynt quite let's keep on rollin see stop before the snap cob on the catch and a gain of 14 yards it will stand it appears and it will offside number 72 defense their penalty is declined result to play first step we saw it there in the first quarter when they Rogers takes a shot down the field he wanted to hear but there was nobody going deep for the Packers Hank Rogers was hoping one of them would pick up on the flag and just try to give him a shot but they still get the completion in 1814 more yards piled up by Rogers the 40 I chill back there in coverage and gain of 21 just great protection up front lettuce offensive line you see the time that Rodgers has to slide he wants to take a shot deep down the middle of the field to Jordy Nelson it's not there he's able to wait for Randall Cobb to come into the picture that's just great execution by that front almost any article play to start the game for greenback this one is in the air identify Roger it's interesting what's going on out in Arizona with the Cardinals leading the Detroit Lions because Detroit's on top of the NFC North Green Bay hoping they're tied at the end of the day Green Bay lost at Detroit and that was Troy when Aaron Rodgers came out after a 1 &amp; 2 start five letters relax we're going to be ok they are more than okay they end the season week 17 with a matchup here at Lambeau nineteen second and ten passes clock Carrie Williams Randall Cobb when he came to Green Bay he was primarily a slot receiver and he's played more on the outside this year primarily because they're moving Jordy Nelson around a little bit more so when they move Jordy Nelson to the middle of the field then that'll put Randall Cobb on the outside but he has really grown as a receiver and just having a great season a lot of 2,000 formations on this drive from Nelson watching into this play and make sure it gets his feet down sure does wow that's an outstanding job we miss route by Jordan house just goes right by Fletcher once again a perfect throw by Aaron Rodgers Jordy Nelson in my opinion Joe is having a pole pole season and if he doesn't get voted in this year something's wrong Aaron Rodgers is thrown for 232 yards already and two touchdowns we don't pretend to go in I like what Aaron Rodgers told us yesterday first we'll sort this out about the weapons he has at his disposal but in particular about Jordy Nelson scheppers will give us a call number 96 defense it's our friend Benny Logan with Aaron Rodgers said that fiveyard penalty will be enforced on the kickoff I have now the best number one receiver I've ever had here in Green Bay we're not as deep as we were a couple of years ago with Greg Jennings and Donald Driver and germinal Finlay and guys like that but him saying that about Jordy Nelson says a lot because he's had some guys on the outside the throw team this sure has an Jordy Nelson is healthy he's battled some hamstring issues in years past having another great year at thousandyard receiver a year ago and it's 24 to 3 this combination just lethal Aaron Rodgers Jordy Nelson seven more points on the board in a 21point game if you ever get the chance who saved every time you're ever offered the opportunity to come here to Green Bay at Lambeau Field and watch football here it's not like any other venue is certainly in the NFL maybe anywhere it's a special place it's especially nice for us Joe with Mike Steve Peck from Green Bay you get the brats and the meatballs and the whole experience it's got our own little tailgate out there at the TV compound a screen base very own Mike Steve back and they pile into this Stadium and have such fun here talking about how quiet they've been with Green Bay out there on offense and then they make the noise they just keep adding to this stadium it's bigger and better every year and they've turned it into a yearround venue with restaurants a great Hall of Fame it's just great do you know what tonight is I give up it's Sunday Funday Sunday today joy all new episodes of TV's best comedies starts tonight at 8 Eastern 7 central on Fox Jilla truly Oh doing his thing on Brooklyn ninenine it's been dominated by Green Bay 252 yards the majority of the second quarter is still left coin brought down by Morgan Burnett night you made a good point that because they're so fast Philadelphia even down 21 points it really doesn't take the ground game away they may just do what they're gonna do yeah they don't chew up much time even on their scoring plays they've only had three drives all year of five minutes or more there's another terrible goodness he's got a first down for Philadelphia Sean McCoy last week had a rough one have been really picking it up over the previous four games three times this year he's been held to under 25 yards Russia well a lot of it has to do with the offensive line and just how banged up they've battled here Cooper as well Jeremy Maclin gets 40 yards Sam shields on attack it really is remarkable for the Green Bay Packers Brian belaga their right tackle is the only starter to miss a start this season he's missed one game for the Philadelphia Eagles Jason Peters our left tackle he's the only guy who's played every game here's a handoff to squirrels he's got a first down one a pickup in a trade that made by Howie Roseman the general manager of fifth round pick to New Orleans to get number 43 he's a special player in his 10th season still making those kinds of moves every offense that he's played for when he's left they've been worse San Diego and then New Orleans and he's made this team a lot better sprained his MCL Mistah game it's still able to make here's McCoy right side as you talk about it the Eagles have had six different starting offensive line combinations which ties for the most across the NFL and ten different guys have made a start which is the most across the NFL but they're almost back to what they'd hoped now that lost Harriman's for the year that last year will not play together season long here's McCoy right side no game well you think about it Joe when you lose those kinds of players and those starts from offensive linemen and yet you're still seven and two and you're averaging over 400 yards a game to imagine some real credit to the players that they've got lost on that coaching staff they're down in six Sam channeis he's got a man Matthews off his hands and that combination that was so good on Monday night Sanchez and Matthews they cannot connect well he has Jordan math used to the corner and a ball that Jordan Matthews generally catches just off the fingertips it was that close that was a big third down for this Philadelphia team and trying to get something going trying to keep Aaron Rodgers on the sidewalk Jones hits it and over and Kabul let it go behind there man bonanza so we'll take a break and when we come back after Matthews came so close to a big first down see Rogers there is the pack of 21 it's new this season here at Lambeau they can celebrate the fans can their own Lambeau leap 4 year old while in really celebrating her Lambeau leap here's a Philadelphia defense it's got to come up with a take away very leans to stop Laci doing all he can Jenkins on the stop a gain of six the size of the Eagles defense sorry Troy with nine return touchdowns between what they've done on special teams and defensively we've got 21 straight games with the takeaway that's the best active streak they need one here yeah they sure do and I'll tell you if they're going to continue to single up on these receivers as they have throughout much of this game Aaron Rodgers might have six touchdowns a game tonight Rodgers keeps it Rogers and even a ball that's knocked out and fumbled by Aaron Rodgers ends up okayed for Green Bay they lose only three and have a third down coming up curry knocked it out the curry comes in from behind Rogers and knocks it out Packers are fortunate that the Eagles weren't able to come up with that play and you're right Joe that's what the Eagles are looking for they've had a hard time slowing down this offense they've been opportunistic throughout the year with the takeaways they almost were able to get them one well now third down and seven really extra men on the Rajpath Scott got enough for a first down made a move picked it up picks up 13 on third down the Bradley Fletcher's had a tough first half been beaten a couple times already if he makes his tackle the Packers are punting the football to the Eagles instead Randall Cobb who is so good in small spaces he's able to make him miss pick up the first down looks pretty nervous it'll be a first down play when we come back Aaron Rogers doing his thing and his Packers up 21 all of Fame quarterback play here in Green Bay in the tradition the great Bart Starr Aaron Rodgers red farmed the records through their first 96 starts tappable Favre the best at 66 and 30 right behind him that part star actors will take off and slide to the first down inside Philadelphia territory 16yard carry for Aaron Rodgers that ties his season law Davis is wondering what he needs to do as a defensive coordinator this time they give help to the outside to play man coverage so they've got the receivers covered down the field and Aaron Rodgers is able to take off scrambling and just nobody there than to make the play Aaron can do that it usually moves with his eyes downfield looking to even the Philadelphia FortiGate steps up and drops it off and lacy could not make the catch talked about Bart Starr is battling some health issues five NFL titles including the first two Super Bowls led the pack to six divisional titles MVP of both Super Bowls one and two and went into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1977 I got I don't know why but I got the chance to ride to the Super Bowl Arlington Texas with Bart his wife and cherry that's that's one of the great highlights of my life a car ride with a Hall of Famer to the Super Bowl that involved the factors in the Steelers second down and 10 he's got another first down but I want to hear what you have to say about the great gentleman that is Bart Starr you know Bart Starr lives there in Birmingham Alabama I had two surgeries by dr. James Andrews during my career in both times I went to the hospital there Bart Starr was there to greet me and just wanted to say hello and welcome me to his town he's a real gentleman and we wish him well party in 18 gonna get on first down just for Matt on the rush NASA's dropped off for Lacey and Lacey outofbounds on first and tenth with a game of a they're going to have some celebration here Lambeau Field at some point when they bring Brett Favre back when they have Bart Starr here and they honored what Aaron Rodgers has already done that was talked to them might have happened last week in the Chicago game bars dealing with the health issues but when that time comes to pass it's going to be something to watch gets it on a toss thanks play defensively up front and Michael Kendricks joins sent reportin for the tackle you know the only thing I can really liken it to Joe offhand is the situation in San Francisco when Joe Montana leaves and Steve Young steps in he had been his understudy they draft Aaron Rodgers in the first round here while Brett Favre was their quarterback and he steps in and now he's having to help hall of fame career it's it's really something the level of quarterback playing along with Bart Starr who got it all going but from Brett Favre in there Aaron Rodgers these fans been in for a real treat three years the understudy to fought here's Nelson Nelson on the other end of the xix a gain of 10 was just not much that Jordy Nelson can't do they put them in the slot they run the slant route to him balls got to come out the Eagles are bringing pressure Aaron Rodgers puts it right on them and another first down for the Packers Aaron Rodgers and Mike McCarthy big teams to blitz there's nobody better in the league at beating a blitz than number 12 a oneonone with Randall Cobb and Jordy Nelson they're going to beat most defensive backs in this league 3:19 as for Nelson Fletcher got ahold of Nelson to the endzone and it will be pass interference number 44 defense first down see the rig release Jordy Nelson working against Fletcher once again and Aaron Rogers unable to lay this ball because of worry was on the field like he would like to he had to drive it in and the Seas got the hold there of the arm he'd just been overmatched Bradley Fletcher has been in that mantoman coverage versus Jordy Nelson they've been talking about how these corners have been playing better Kerry Williams and Bradley Fletcher late they both had a pick last week but just ripped apart here in Lambeth gives way she put a touchdown and the frustration boiling over for the Eagles and Connor Barwon who's going to chase down the offensive lineman Lane Taylor and then peel away with exactly two minutes left Eddie Lacey carries for his fifth touchdown of the year John Coon third fullback makes a nice lead block offensive line comes off the ball it's an excellent job finishing off that drive with a touchdown miss Green Bay Packers off and we talked about what they've done here at Lambeau continuing with that again tonight there's that will be one of the rare mistakes were at the twominute warning here in Lambeau Field it'll be thirty to three with two minutes to go past aces my fault we got a tackle as punishment two minutes to go first half follow your favorite team all season long all you have to do is go to itunes.com slash NFL a cup of coffee or hot tea for Mike McCarthy you've just got a contract extension the impresses me Tory every time we talk to him with how in charge and control of every phase of what they do here in Green Bay he is meanwhile so skirt he's in control what's coming up coming up with a Visa halftime the rams pull up a huge upset over the broncos the bengals father lay back in the first place steve with the falcons and mike evans had a monster game at washington highlights and so much more when we come back with the visa halftime take a look at the NFC East Philadelphia right now trailing by 27 there on top Dallas on a bye week Dallas at the Giants next week completion to start the drive is Zach Ertz and then Dallas host Philadelphia on Thanksgiving and what should be a great game here on Fox it's going to be interesting to see where these teams are at when they meet up that night against each other but this drive right now with the Philadelphia Eagles is importantly they've not placed where this one survived offense fiveyard penalty remains first down and yet they've only got three points in their defense has been struggling they need to try to come away with some points entered in this first half Joe and I think it was a game that offensively they thought they would be able to come in and run the football against his Packers defense but that hasn't happened in the run game now with the score one des Sanchez can't handle the snap in the shotgun and after the false start by lame Johnson the Eagles are going backward snaps lolo but it's one that should be easily handled and talked about it last week when Sanchez came in was a little jittery early in that game he settled in but just said he's been knocked around a little bit here in this first half but this hasn't really been able to settle in place for this offense on second and 20th scrolls what's up good blocking and he slides at the 30 with under a minute to go and Philadelphia will watch Green Bay take the timeout with third and long coming up and you see in this battle for the NFC East the top two teams and the Eagles and the Cowboys with their upcoming schedules with the Cowboys being off this weekend you know that they're paying close attention to what's happening here in Green Bay you know with the Eagles and Nick Foles going down and you know what does that mean to this team able to win last week but this is the type of game where you find out you know how you contend against some of these better teams and right now Green Bay is hard to beat at home Joanna's first half reveals about third down and 12 Green Bay down to one timeout left Sanchez steps up what a catch that's Earths he's got a first down and so the Green Bay Packers took the time out hoping to get the ball back and get more points in the timeout stops the clock and now it's Philadelphia using their first timeout as they have a little life here after a 15 yard catch by Zach Ertz that's an outstanding play by herbs being able to slow up and up and make a play on the ball just a little confusion there between Sanchez and Hurd Sanchez thought he was gonna throttle down Earth State on the move but he was able to still make the play so still two timeouts remaining for Philadelphia 50 seconds on the clock there are the numbers for Sanchez 9 for 12 down by 27 pulls it down and goes for the bigger throw he's got Matthews and the rookie with the first down at the 15 yard line a 40 yard completion to jordan matthews initially it looks like Sanchez was going to keep it and run but he catches jordan matthews running up the seam and delivers a perfect ball on first down another pump fake ends on Matthews incomplete 18 seconds left in the half Mark Sanchez took another hit at the end of that completion of Matthews which is set it up now second down and 10 at the 15 yard line he's been banged around a little bit is next a little bit sore the Packers have been able to get pressure throughout this first half look three sacks in the half they've knocked him around a few times more Sanchez Boyd's his septic goes to the end zone but sue Cooper and now ten seconds left in third and ten Eagles will get the ball to start the second half right now trying to drive it into the end zone his Mark Sanchez he's got a third and ten and only ten seconds left just count it away Sanchez out to his left gonna throw away and it's fourth down and Chip Kelly is going to have to take the points claim Matthews with pressure yet again adjacent Peter stumbles coming out and he's got clay Matthew as you see as he stumbles and it just opens up the lane then and Mark Sanchez just has no chance to try to hang in the pocket and allow someone to come open so they walk in they're able to move the ball but then once they've gotten inside the redzone they've just stalled 33 yard attempts he is 1 for 1 parking from this distance in this first half he's been a bright spot he is now hit 15 straight and it's a 24point game so Sanchez able to get them down the field and get that opportunity but coming up short of the touchdown it is a 30 to 6 game piece a halftime is coming up right now America's game of the week continue second half right now start of the third quarter and it's a twenty four point game and now we give you our excitement brought to you by Nissan the excitement is the first half for Aaron Rodgers it may be another short stint for Aaron Rodgers and this one if it keeps up because right now the Eagles need to come up with some stops defensively but yeah well that's the first thing they have to do is be able to make some stops now they're getting the ball here to start this second half they've got to be able to finish some drives and to keep these drives going they have not been very good on third down so they've got to convert on third down but when they get down in there as we've seen fill goals are just not going to cut it they weren't going to cut it coming into this game now they have to be able to come away with touchdown so we'll see how the Eagles get along here in the second half with Mark Sanchez at quarterback he was knocked around pretty good in that first half and as you look at some of the numbers in the statistics ground game really not a factor on either side passing yardage is big for Green Bay there's the number you looked at Troy the third down conversions one four six for Philadelphia reason why drives stall Chris polka waiting for the kick from Crosby they'll take it me so the drive will start having 20 and down we go to Erin Andrews Jo I didn't even need to ask Chip Kelly anything going into the half he came up to me and I'm cleaning this up nicely when he said whoa we really stunk then he said we have got to find a way to get some pressure on route Aaron Rodgers I have no idea how we do it but the guy has way too much time as for his own quarterback Mark Sanchez he said we got to clean some things up and I asked why are they getting so much pressure on him so quickly he said those oneonone matchups up front we are missing them we are losing them let's see how they start here in the second half as Macklin makes the catch hang on after getting that initial hit a gain of seven to start the second half for Macklin well you think back to that game last week when they beat Carolina would help them Joe was they get the big punt return by Darren Sproles again flexor with an interception return for a touchdown they got some help they haven't been able to get much help around Mark Sanchez in that first half here's McCoy he's bottled up by Julius Peppers we haven't said his name yet today no game and that's been the biggest part of it for Philadelphia they've just not been able to get with John McCoy going it looked like they had their running game going a few weeks ago then last week not so they haven't been able to get it going here in this added to the pressure on Mark Sanchez to have to do everything through the air on third down and three Sanchez got a man's got a first down and that man is Macklin putting together the best starting to a season in his career missed all of last year with a torn ACL shunned a longterm contract bet on himself and so far that's been a good bet well an excellent route you see he's able to get term on Williams his hips turned and once they turn then he's beat on the route he turns in Sanchez has protection on that throw and delivers a good ball he six yards to Macklin they faked the endaround now it's out to Cooper was the one who came around from the other side of the formation that had it handed to him they throw it to him for a gain of five whether they're trying to hit the homerun ball down the middle and Dom Capers knows this offense is really based on their ability to create big plays down the field they have to keep those to a minimum they've done that and they got good coverage then on Mac when trying to go to the depot second down there five quick snap and now samba Nick Perry is and the Packers take over as McCoy put it on the ground so just when the Eagle started to gain some momentum in and out of the arms of LeSean McCoy and the Packers take over up 24 that is a shot inside Packers city antiques located in the shadow of Lambeau Field 22 years in the business and there's the reaction by McCoy after he couldn't secure the handoff from Mark Sanchez he 19 from the 45 its Aaron Rodgers completion and it's in identity arms Jordy Nelson with Bradley Fletcher there and Nelson added it looked like for a moment it sure did looks like he had the catch momentarily Aaron Rodgers lays it out there perfectly Bradley Fletcher makes up could have laid it out actually a little bit more he was up out in front of Fletcher but do I get the turnover off the fumble on LeSean McCoy and so many times you see these coordinators even after the TV timeout they try to take his shot down on the field and Green Bay does had it just failed to connect just it get it away Rogers throws it away and we'll see if that draws a flag it could the officials will get together and see if there was a receiver close enough to avoid an intentional grounding ball and they're gonna throw the flag definitely in the pocket Rogers avoiding the sack pressure by Boyken I'm not sure the ball got across the line of scrimmage either on the throw tensional grounding number 12 offense that ball would be placed at the spot of the foul loss it down third down so that's a good defensive play by the Eagles they come up with that and the pressure from Boykin yeah well we heard Erin Andrews and her visit with Chip Kelly talked about how they needed to get pressure on Rogers in the pocket and they bring the bring the X pressure with Boykin and Rogers had nowhere to go that he's had to dump it and he gets called so now third down and 22 we talked about how the Packers loves teams to blitz Aaron Rodgers coming in the quarterback rating 124 of facing a blitz he's good on third down and converted third and 18 in the first half we'll see if the Eagles can make a stop now gate 3:19 just get it away again Rodgers steps up throws and incomplete and the direction of Randall Cobb and Boykin was back there in coverage after coming on the Blitz the previous play and Rodgers when Rafi was looked like he's unhappy with himself on that one even at third and 22 and he had a chance but good job then by Philadelphia aided by the penalty on the intentional grounding but getting off the field and making a stop here's Tim masking his first punt waiting Florida's Darren Sproles he hit one last week's cause he's the top punt returner in the NFL and he will look for winter on trip duck as he crosses the 30 a six yard return Eagles get it right back after the turnover of three it out Billy down 24 today the Packers are wearing a recreation of the 1929 uniform for players that championship team are in the Hall of Fame Cal Humber to tackle fullback mike mckowski hat black hat back his john blood McNally and Curly Lambeau and a Hall of Fame obviously with what he did here in Green Bay so it's throwback uniform day here in Green Bay in case you're just tuning in wondering what game you're watching there you go small numbers in the front big ones on the way Leigh Matthews with the hair on number 52 on first down Sanchez has to pull it down and Matthews still gets up and knocks it away what an athlete it's an amazing athlete you know as we talked about earlier for him to be able to make the switch and play some inside linebacker and then he comes out in these packages that they have defensively where he still plays on the outside and rushes the passer a lot of scouts when he was coming out of the USC felt that he could play any position in linebacker for three scheme three for inside outside doesn't matter second and ten just three men on the nowhere close to Matlin Matthews was in that areas well kind of a weird week here in week 11 around the NFL and the early game leaders Jay Cutler who had that rough to put it nicely game here last week there's his day and a win for Chicago Kenny Britt and a stunning upset the Rams at home over Denver down in ten and this one gets away from Sanchez he was aiming for Zach Ertz and that one just took off yeah it sure did and he had he had time in the pocket Joe this time there was no pressure he has a pretty clean pocket he's got Zach Ertz and he's got a step on him ball just gets away from him you see his frustration going back to the sideline fourth punt for Donnie Jones he's already got a tough shot in this game waiting he'll stay away and not a good punt by Jones at all Mark Sanchez hanging his head on his way over to the sidelines it's been a frustrating day to this point Packers dominance for wonderful backers offense back on the field of Green Bay team that's averaging over 40 points per game here at home the seasons big numbers again for Aaron Rodgers the day for any lacy the day for Jordy Nelson starting at their 37 up by 24 looking right now back to the left avoiding a set Rodgers going to take off he's brought down from behind by Fletcher Cox after a gain of 16 yards that in one play is how good that guy is well it's just maddening for Bill Davis in this Eagles defense that you cover up the receivers finally you got a fourman rush with good pressure and Aaron Rodgers shows the type of athlete that he is and tucking the ball and picking up a big game that's his second 16 yard carry in this game Rodgers to the she's looking for the tight end Richard Rodgers second and 10 you know last week they put Conner Barwon in a spy position against Cam Newton he had three sacks playing that position last week and I asked Bill Davis if they would use him as a spy on Aaron Rodgers Aaron really isn't known as a scrambler he he buys time and looks to throw we saw that he's capable of doing that and Bill Davis said yeah they would still employ the spy against Aaron Rodgers it speaks volumes for him movin up second down and ten Rogers comes underneath and a nice play is made starts on the catch Carrie Williams on the tackle a gain of three pretty good onetwo punch there with Betty Lacy and James Starks though he catches the ball there and that's the one area I was visiting with Aaron Rodgers about it that as good as the receivers have been for him over the years they've never had that Darren Sproles type of guys who catched balls out of the backfield most of the receptions at these backs get her on screen rights as well as check down 58 banana bread Green 18 we don't get it they're down seven passes is closed Adams with a catch and we'll see where they mark it looks like they're going to mark him with enough for a first down they are nice catch by Davante Adams who got his third touchdown catch earlier tonight talking to Aaron Rodgers he said we're just up tempo they have this kind of muddle huddle receivers don't even get into the huddle they stay on the outside you know dip plays relate to him on first down Roger steps up and he hits his guy passes caught that's Cobb down inside the toy so he'll wait for him to take off and Rodgers pulls up and hits Randall Cobb in stride for 20 yards a kind of a natural pick there with the tight end and Randall Cobb as he pushes up the field and the man in coverage versus Cobb gets caught up in it Cobb comes out of it just wide open Cobbs over 100 yards for the fourth time this season every 19 Nelson over a hundred as well he starts he slips are you talking about the grass here it's called didi grass Master hybrid it's a grass system that only three NFL stadiums use however one of the other two is Philadelphia's home field at Lincoln Financial Field talking to Aaron Rodgers he said teams come in here and have a tough time figuring out what spikes to use what cleats because the footing can be treacherous here at Lambeau but as you said not a problem for Philadelphia sand sets also the same surface they play up so now second down and off justice starts bouncing it outside around par 1 and ends up picking up 4 and talk about this uptempo offense of the Packers I thought it was interesting that this was the one game where they said they were going to slow it down a little bit compared to what they like to do normally because they wanted to allow their defense to get a little more rest knowing what they were facing in this Eagles offense but the Eagles defense is good enough job on their own of getting off the field and affording themselves some time on the bench Green Bay six four eight on third down his third day Oh one for the end zone good throw Fletcher and coverage it's poured down really good throw they run a wheel route they got Randall Cobb in the slot position and Aaron Rodgers lays it out there Fletcher is able to look like he got a hand on it just as Cobb was trying to make that catch but a really nice throw once again by Aaron Rodgers this guy is really something to watch boy 33 yard attempt coming from Mason Crosby he's missed only once this year his head coach Mike McCarthy stuck with him he sneaks that one in after a rock 2012 2 for 2 today 15 for 16 on the year and the lead 27 America's Candida lead continues it's a 33 six games under 8 to go third quarter the Eagles about to get the ball back Mark Sanchez in his first year and his second year with the Jets helped to take his team to the AFC Championship game each season but it was a defensive minded team with a good ground game as Chris Pope returns the ball out just across the 25 Brad Jones on the stop Sanchez coming back to work down by 27 week 11 continues with Sunday Night Football tonight at 8:30 Eastern on NBC and tune in tomorrow for Monday Night Football on ESPN 2 the Steelers and the Titans good matchup tonight with New England at Indianapolis that'll make now and Chris and Michelle Greg Goodell a smile here's Sanchez from the 26 out of the shotgun fastestselling is good enough for a first down until you talk about Mark Sanchez there with the Jets you know a lot of people thought it came out of SC a little bit early and he did take him to the two AFC championship games and it was a defensive minded team and running the football and it's hard then to appreciate quarterback play and I think over the years he just began to lose some confidence in himself here's McCoy with some room to run good play by Quinten dicks but he's hurt big tackle by Clinton dicks is there was a lot of room for McCoy if he could have gotten past the rookie they're checking on the guy they drafted in the first round to be that center fielder ball hawk type take a break here at Lambeau Dick's got up and got off the field with no issues that got an ovation here in the Lambo looks to be alright second down and five Hicks is way close to a first down a yard short like Neal on the tackle for Green Bay I will see now what Philadelphia is able to do on third down here and it's been a tough down for them throughout this game they've been facing a lot of third and Long's but here it's McCoy and it's a first down for Sanchez who was really the starter for one full year in 2008 at USC drafted fifth overall by the Jets to the championship game as we mentioned when he had guys like Thomas Jones and Shawn green and then blue Damien Thomlinson and that good defensive minded team with Rex Ryan in charge they're asking him to do a lot more now in Philly this one the hands of Josh Huff you know that situation there in New York Joe it got to where it was he was looked upon as a guy that hey we don't need you to win the game just don't lose it for us you know because we do have a good defense we do have good runners and I just don't think you can play quarterback in this league when that's what people are thinking of you or if that's what the organization is asking of you because to win games in this league you've got to be able to make plays at that position and over the years you just saw his performance continued to decline here intercept get it his throne peppers his evening the end zone for the touchdown but a flag is down that is the eleventh career interception for Julius Peppers year one of a threeyear deal he's got a nice addition illegal low block on the passing team number three so to add insult to insult it's the penalty against Sanchez yeah use call to jive seen this play before from Julius Peppers and once the balls in his hand come and this guy could run and how easy did he make it look on the Lambeau leap from he's got basketball background but that you have to see if you're Mark Sanchez Julius Peppers just drops right off the line of scrimmage and is right in the throwing leg that's what threw the flag for Sanchez it's the second touchdown this year it's blocked and so now in a thirty nine to six game you know let's go big picture and let's look at where Philadelphia came into this game it came in as a first place Club they lose Nick Foles some already are riding off Nick Foles and that that's way too premature but with Mark Sanchez a lot is on him now more than he had on him with the Jets where are the Philadelphia Eagles after taking a beating here today at Lambeau well there's there's a lot of good teams that have taken a beating here at Lambeau so I don't want to draw you know any real conclusions Mark Sanchez can play better but everybody can play better the defense can he hadn't gotten much help they haven't been able to run the football III I think the other way to look at this is from Green Bay's perspective this was an important ball game if you look at their three losses that they've had Jo against Seattle against Detroit against New Orleans all Road games but against teams that figure to play into the equation when you get into the postseason this was an important game for them against the team that came in to this one leading the NFC East and they dominated Brandon Bair by the way the guy who got up and got a hand on that extra point attempt by Crosby you think about the movement of some pretty big time defensive players with Jared Allen ending up with Chicago Julius Peppers ending up here in Green Bay that's been big the 50 drives it through the uprights let's take a look at the NFC West San Francisco one today they're now tied with Seattle who lost to Kansas City Arizona is leading last time I looked and they are on top at eight and one and who knows what that fourth down completion from Colin Kaepernick downfield of Michael Crabtree to help force overtime in New Orleans last week gets San Francisco that might have saved their year well yeah it seems like we're saying that each week I mean they've been clawing out some wins a lot of turmoil in San Francisco but they want Macklin with a catch a gain of seven with zermat williams on the cupboard second and three still over five and a half to go in this third quarter thirty nine to six game one snap handoff to McCoy and we shot McCoy with his best carry of the day out to the 40yard line game 13 Micah Hyde on the tackle see the offensive lineman these are guys playing up front injured Josh sitting with a bad toe TJ Lange with a bad ankle the rookie in between him Corey Linsley and the tackles they've done a good job protecting Aaron Rodgers today Sanchez throws pass caught Cooper and Riley Cooper with a first down inside Green Bay territory brought down by shields now that offensive line and you mentioned just sitting and what he's playing through he's got a torn ligament in his big toe that's a painful injury may even require surgery and he's he's getting out there and playing he didn't practice all last week Jenny Lang didn't either and it's one down the men Sanchez had him but let him to far we've seen a couple of those here tonight Joe work Mark Sanchez has had some opportunities to make some big plays and just has not been able to connect and you don't well and Chip Kelly's offense you do you get a lot of those opportunities it seems when you watch them play but there was another opportunity for a big play in a touchdown and they just fell to connect on pass is caught that's the tightend Hertz good for six no it was interesting and visiting with Mark Sanchez and you know he felt like there's a bit of a rebirth here and he's so excited to be playing for an offensive coach and and like the culture and everything that's happening right now in Philadelphia there's some real enthusiasm around this team the guys work hard and very excited to be quarterbacking especially after the win last week didn't have one of didn't have many of those there at the end in New York out of the back Jets goes over thrown on third down it'll be fourth down and the Eagles will go for it down by 33 there's another touchdown pass Jim Kelly designed it beautifully they've got Darren Sproles and trying to cover him up with a linebacker and there was nobody there in just another air throw fourth down and four Sanchez picks it up he's got a first down as he connects with Hertz and a nice throw by Mark Sanchez good for 22 yards good throw good route and the flag is down back at the 44 ease of hands hands to the face number 98 defense that penalty is declined result of the play first down it's a guy on the March Sanchez had good protection in front of them and Zach Ertz who I really like is it tied in a young player in this league get some separation so big fourth down conversion secondround pick out of Stanford last year Ernst he checks out the first down at the 18th boy inside the 15 Chip Kelly was a trendsetter in the NFL before he was in the NFL and a guy led all the success at Oregon what a job he's done after some misfires with bigtime college coaches coming to the NFL guys like Petrino excitement Steve Spurrier Chip Kelly nothing but success really anywhere is Mexican movie that gets it down inside the tent Bill Belichick and his staff spent some time visiting with Chip Kelly when he was at Oregon and you're right he's impacted the NFL long before he got here to start coaching last season and he's the real deal his offense is very sound does a great job apply a lot of pressure on a defense there's a crawl as they faked the handoff it's Matthew's he's gonna come touched it he had to last week and he's got one here today and the Eagles finally get it into the end zone they get the ball out to Macklin and you're gonna see Perry or Riley Cooper who comes up he knows he's not going to get the ball excuse me Jordan Matthews it's just a matter of Matthew's beating his man oneonone he breaks the tackle and able to get it in the end zone he gets through a Morgan Burnett and into the end zone he is a big big slot receiver 63 to 12 and the rookie out of Vanderbilt second round pick they hit with this guy he is gonna be a good player and it seems like he's already a good player and who knows how far he will carry that that's next week Fox NFL Sunday and some good matchups with Detroit at New England early these Packers Vikings Cardinals and Seahawks and a big one out the NFC West and to talk about Jordan Matthews a job that he's dying one of the reasons why he's been able to have as much success as he's had this year he's a real bright guy so he picked up the offense quickly was a finance major there at Vanderbilt and he's a big target and that's what Chip Kelly likes your memory led to Sean Jackson go and you know he often said the reason was he just likes bigger wide receivers I think there was more to it than that but Jordan Matthews certainly fits that bill and has had a really nice rookie season you got a lot of work with Mark Sanchez during camp and the preseason and it looks like Sanchez looks his way certainly did last week on Monday night against Carolina when Matthews had seven catches 138 yards and two touchdowns he got up here and Matthews had to fight his way into the end zone now to kick off the turkey with Harris waiting for it they will start at the 20 and honor of Veterans Day for every point scored during the NFL's 32 salute to service games the league donates $100 to each of its nonprofit partners Pat Tillman Foundation USO and Wounded Warrior Project as gesture by the NFL here in week 11 these races are getting more and more interesting as we go as green baize aiming for a tie atop the north a good game out in the desert in their arizona up by only eight now not across the 25 I really haven't relied much on Eddie Lacy in this ballgame just a handful of carries and it's been more their ability to throw the football with with Aaron Rodgers it's been a pretty good pretty good approach Rodgers 309 yards two touchdowns 21 of 33 second and four here's Lacey again she is going to carry a pile for the first down as he picks up five good Mike McCarthy is doing here here the Eagles put together that drive and come away with a touchdown and now on this possession they come out and run the ball a couple times with Eddie Lacy and they're able to pick up the first down see if they can't get this thing into the fourth quarter this Green Bay team there at Minnesota next then they have New England Atlanta at Buffalo at Tampa Bay they end the season week 17 with a home date with the Lions were having one in Wisconsin since 1991 timeout taken by Aaron Rodgers the play clock down to one so here are the upcoming schedules for these two teams the top two in the NFC North Detroit at New England interesting the Green Bay has the Patriots coming up in just two weeks we'll be there for Detroit Patriots see how they finish against each other and they may be tied at the top of the division before the end of the bed at the end of the day here today and just looking at the schedules and as you pointed out earlier the fact that they finished playing each other that could turn out to be a heck of a ball game under a minute to go in this third quarter Green Bay had to use their first timeout his biggest 2:35 a 37yard carry for the second year per line of Alabama really great patience by Eddie Lacy they've bottle it up he has to cut back Malcolm Jenkins was in a position and it's just a tough man to get to the ground Kendricks bounces off of him those are three good runs by Eddie Lacy and the 37 yard carry is the longest Packer run of the season so now the numbers starting to pile up for Lacey Eddie Lacy all smiles after that big Alabama win has he's dragged to the ground by Fletcher Cox and that'll do it for quarter number three here at Lambeau what a day for the Packers they are rolling let's go to the fourth back after this from your local Fox station second down in ten fourthorder here at lambeau see the time of possession the yards really not that crazy imbalanced but the score is thirty nine thirteen Green Bay with a football here we go into the on second attempt playaction protected time runs out think about Troy would be Packers have done here at home last week 55 to 14 over Chicago so far this afternoon and tonight 39 at 13 over Philadelphia 94 points here at home for this Aaron Rodgers led offense the last two weeks it's really something we you know we've known for many many years the real homefield advantage for these Packers and Aaron Rodgers this year he's had it he's had a great season we talked about it earlier that he's certainly on the shortlist for league MVP consideration but he has been redhot here at home now third down and 10 he was left alone at play really kind of says it all as to how this game has gone here tonight Aaron Rodgers nothing down the field just drops it off to Daddy lacing it and then the fun begins there were a number of guys five six guys with a chance to get him on the ground and they just failed to do so it's great effort by Eddie Lacy coming away with the score that is a 32 yard catch and run his second touchdown of the through the air and they love this secondyear thrall Eddie Lacy Aaron Rodgers loved it so the Jordy Nelson 46:13 Green Bay America's game of the week and it has been all green bay as they lead by 33 and Freddy Lacy and his second year it's his first career game with a rushing touchdown and a receiving touchdown Crosbie to kick it away he does and waiting for his pole take a look at some of the numbers from other early games Andy Dalton is the Bengals make up for that disappointing effort against Cleveland with a win at New Orleans Jamaal Charles in the wind for Kansas City over Seattle and JJ Watt you'll see it on the highlight shows if you haven't already lining up in the offense again in catching basically a fade with a brilliant catch along the boundary toward the back of the end zone he could play tight end in this league if he wanted to he picks up 600 office stuff sorry talking about Cincinnati when Sean Payton's not used to losing there at home and here they've lost backtoback games now after the loss last week to San Francisco hard to believe last week was their first home loss Sean Payton on the sidelines it's 2010 he was suspended 2012 they get stuff and now they lose backtoback games and so with that New Orleans is tied on top of the NFC South at four and six Carolina's right there and Tampa Bay's only a couple of games yeah don't count out Tampa Bay not they took apart Washington earlier today reminds me of when we made the playoffs in high school made the state playoff we were too late there's Sanchez just getting rid of it pass up for grabs intercepted by turbine Sanchez it looked like was just throwing it away he was under pressure he was looking for Jeremy Maclin and Williams makes the pick well it doesn't help that Jeremy Maclin look lost his footing coming out of the break but Mark Sanchez under pressure really just laid it up for mine Williams comes down with the interception you see the pressure off the edge that forces Sanchez to get the ball out that ball was hanging pretty good that's Peppers who was right in his face Julius Peppers who already has his second touchdown of a year here today with an interception return for one earlier back out there is Aaron Rodgers that's a bit surprising and starts with carrion but he was aware of the NFL record for Malphite starts to break out scheffers the referee a good job to get in there and break it up but last week Aaron Rodgers was aware that the NFL record for touchdown passes we've just tied and shared by a few including Nick Foles 7 in a game he had six he came out and he said he was aware and would have liked to take a shot at it against Chicago and didn't get the chance I'm sure he would have you know that's a game you don't want to come out of when you're having the success that he was having he better enjoy whatever's left on this possession because pretty certain Mike McCarthy is going to pull him out after this series along with some of those offensive linemen that benefited from them being able to rest last week being pulled in the third quarter now even the crowds making noise walking face second and three starts again this big nose tentacle bitty Logan a loss of three Brandon Graham was there as well Brandon Graham who made the transition last year from a down lineman to a standup outside linebacker I've liked life when I've seen him this year in the second season doing it it's not easy but he's been able to get more and more comfortable with that position still playing hard even with the score whether it is four and a half sacks for Graham and he's time for first the league first down we just drop it sliding and he's frustrated that he was unable to come up with a catch its fourth and six and the offense is not coming off the field until right now on the other side of it you know you start wondering if Chip Kelly's going to you know keep Mark Sanchez and LeSean McCoy and some of those guys in the in the game right now Matt Berkeley he could certainly use some of the experience hasn't played much brought in last year and this would be a good opportunity for him this will be a 50yard attempt by Mason Crosby as long this season his 55 career long 58 cold windy dance now pushed wide to the right the Eagles will take over in a 46 13 ballgame it's been a lot of leaping on America's game of the week here at Lambeau today week 11 we got 33 point game in the handoff is to the boys there's your answer for now as we flow up McCoy is sliding around he gains three so we will see McCoy who gets up and shakes it out after losing his footing we do see Sanchez and there's the backup Matt Flynn for Aaron Rodgers I think we've seen the last Rodgers Sanchez groans he's got mad hips and Jordan Matthews who has a touchdown in this game the only Philadelphia touchdown is good for 16 that's really the route that he has excelled on here in his rookie season he's so good at the crossing routes he's good at the intermediate crossing routes as well that's what that one was against Sanchez are able to able to connect here's McCoy and LeSean McCoy is down inside the 35 so just to further your point and this is a Philadelphia team that came in at the start of the day in first place they need a healthy LeSean McCoy here they are trailing by 33 points now that snap Sanchez can't get on it but anyone can and he's going to go down the field untouched for a touchdown out of the hands of Jason Kelsey off the hands of Mark Sanchez and then into the hands of Casey Hayward for a touchdown a little bit like the one we saw earlier in the game the winter air Rogers hands this ball was high like Sanchez might have been able to bring that one in with the score what it is typically you just like to fall on the ball and just take your medicine but know you're trying to make a play you're getting blown out unable to get the hop another touchdown for the Packer and a 49 yard and return second touchdown of the year for Casey Heyward to go back to Nick Foles he's got the broken collarbone now flagged down on the extra point it's been the most eventful extra points we've had all year I'll get the call from Carl scheffers offside number 96 defense at fiveyard penalty will be enforced on the kickoff timeout that's against Benny Logan talk about polls and Sanchez and the Eagles offense when we come back and a 53 to 13 Hayward's guys first two touchdowns of his career this season the frustration mounting for Philadelphia and this is one that they'll just put behind him as soon as they get on the plane head home and get ready for their next game at home against Tennessee that could be a cure for what ails them here today on date against the Titans Wednesday Fox college hoops are back on Fox bones won the great early season matchup the crepe Blue Jays look to upset the 19th ranked Oklahoma Sooners coverage begins 8 Eastern only on Fox Sports 1 and streaming live on Fox Sports go starting to talk about neck falls is out with a fractured collarbone that's the same injury that Aaron Rodgers suffered last year it cost Aaron seven full game this is the second game missed for Nick Foles you see get the loose before today's game the danger is taking a hit on that left collarbone and that's what held Aaron Rodgers out so long it's what frustrated him as he said during the week his advice that Nick Falls is to be patient because you just have to let that thing heal yeah I had the same injury I missed five weeks with it it even hurt early on to turn and throw you know you wouldn't think that you think it is about being able to take a hit no Chip Kelly's not real sure exactly when they might get me close Leana Macklin he's wrapped up by shields and a loss on the play of one right now it's Mark Sanchez and that's going to be the guy they're going to have to ride I think like what you said Joe they come home they host Tennessee next week Tennessee has had a tough year and then they've got the short week when they travel to Dallas and what you know should be a huge game will be a huge game regardless of whatever happens next week and NASA Sanchez steps up and fires downfield barriers again Jordan Matthews and he gets up hurts the Eagles don't need that their new weapon Jordan Matthews good for 36 but in pain it was good coverage too by Shawn Richardson he's in a great position but good ball placement by Sanchez is an outstanding catch by Jordan Matthews like it came right down at left arm left wrist right side down inside the 40 so we'll keep an eye on Jordan Matthews they need him going forward and they're checking him out on the sidelines think about the year last year for Nick Foles we're in 27 touchdowns two interceptions and a quarterback rating third best alltime for a season of over 119 here's one thrown behind Huff Sanchez it off found on the same page it's third down and three close to being on the same page Joe I don't know what I don't know what happened on that last one good to see Jordan Matthews come back into the lineup you talk about the only the two interceptions here's the play again with Jordan Matthews as he comes down that's been the problem for this offenses the turnovers Sanchez's miscibility lawyers say the problem for this offense this year has been the turnovers but they didn't turn the ball over for most of this game and it still didn't help them they really felt that if they could protect the football they'd be in this but they just were unable to slow this Packers offense down and Mark Sanchez now the last two throws has just been wildly off target four down three of sonographic in the great history of the franchise of the Green Bay Packers first time they've gone over 50 in backtoback games they lead by 40 this is a fourth down pass and it's good for a first down to Macklin the Eagles still playing still have their big stars out there with Macklin and Matthews and McCoy this one good for five and a first down well these are important reps for Mark Sanchez the more looks he can get the more snaps he can get within this offense the better off he's going to be here's Cooper stiffarm at the tops out of bounds devon house out there in coverage gain of 8 no it is good though in visiting with jim kelly they carry three quarterbacks as i talked about Matt Barkley now the backup was the third string quarterback and some teams carry only two but Chip Kelly said I can't even imagine trying to bring in a quarterback and have them learn this offense and be prepared to play salad nice move got a first down evil still happens Brad Smith who's listed as a receiver was only a quarterback when he played collegiately at the University of Missouri and played really well there's Brad who is coming up brine surgery back today personal guy plays a lot of special teams wide receiver who said he moonlights a little bit at quarterback Sanchez fakes a handoff Jeremy Maclin into the endzone from 20 yards out from Mark Sanchez and maybe a little something to feel good about with that throwing catch a little maybe a little something but they're looking for some positives as they come out of this game I really do believe that the reason Mark Sanchez and these guys are all still on the field is they've got to get it going and we're going down the homestretch they need to get him some rest so it is a 33 point game after the touchdown from Sanchez to Macklin Matt Flynn is getting ready to Packers about to get it back a 33 point games a day for Aaron Rodgers is finished and there's the drive 10 plays when they can gobble up plays and yards time coming off the clock three minutes 19 seconds that's the Chip Kelly on financiers Harris what a nice game getting a chance at the backfield last week against Chicago returns at 18 yards these fans had any fun here Lambeau Field the last two weeks as you think about the record and green baby twenty nine and three here at Lambeau since 2010 when Aaron Rodgers makes a start you talked about the experience here at Lambeau and this stadium and how they continue to add to it and I'm just really impressed with how they've been able to maintain the integrity of this building it is a very it's a very special place a big part of that from a 22 made of the stars when in the game to hand it off facing Matthews on the tackle a gain of three Matt Flynn he stepped in and was up and down last year when Aaron Rodgers was out good enough to put Green Bay in a position that with Aaron Rodgers coming back for week 17 and a game at Chicago they had a chance with a win to get into the playoffs they did win they got into the playoffs and then lost on a cold day here at Lambeau to San Francisco he was 2 &amp; 2 last year as the starter left there for a while went off to Auckland came back this is an offense that he knows Lambeau Field a gain of two how about this graphic not scored the opponents of Packers here at Lambeau Field 19 to 85 this season this is only their fifth game and put up 219 points here at home as I'm watching the two teams converging at midfield out in Arizona the third down at five it's a first down final 14 to 6 Arizona wins so Green Bay and Detroit will be tied at the top of the NFC North and whether it's Stanton or whoever riding a good defense Troy Arizona keeps proven that they are legit at nine and one now yeah I think you know a lot of people still have some reservations about Arizona but they have proven it you know throughout this season and you know tough with the backup stepping in Drew Stanton won some games for him already now they're gonna be riding him the rest of the one at least three in one here Stark's a nice run the big story today was how they going to play with Stanton they've already played with Stanton they've won with him now they're three and one with a backup his only loss was at Denver holding number 65 offense 10yard penalty repeat first down that's lame Taylor so obviously an opportunity as well to get sitting out of there with that bad toe and we'll check and see if TJ Lange is out there anymore and he's not they've got Garth Gerhart and so those guards get more time off because of the lopsided score as they both battle injury it's Bakhtiari the left tackle sitting adjusts it just added to the active roster Zatanna Justin Furillo he's out there starts with no gain second down and 20 though it is this somewhat interesting that you know in a league where so many of these games come down to who has the ball in the last possession that last week Aaron Rodgers plays only one series in the third quarter and sits out the rest of the game and you know here and this one could have sat out the entire fourth quarter if they had wanted him to but you just don't see many teams being able to rest starters the way that the Packers do on any week and here they've been able to do it in backtoback weeks four to go as this one's floated just out of his reach a flag again as Carl scheffers and his crew they want to get to their average personal foul leg with number 73 office 15yard penalty repeat second down it's JC Treader who is guilty of the lake whip Carl scheffers the referee in his 15th year in the NFL and there it is a good call you know now there's so many statistics with the way the preseason unfolded he's wondering which crew officiating crew is called the most penalties after all those flags in the preseason the answer is this group I'm saying there they're below their average here today I don't know okay they are there a bridging over 20 a game well have been 10 penalties accepted so far in this game second and 35 Stark's is wrapped up Allen bro Allen and ice play in the backfield so now third and 35 I have to get the crows and get a first down that's across the street for those that don't know and actually behind it so it makes no it is yeah well then get a turkey on rye while they're there but ER there's not much that doesn't come with butter in this town third and 35 setting up the screen starts hangs on he can't make it to cross but a flag is down hey Dalit on the tackle black throne late passing utterance number 89 offense a penalties decline result of the play for thousands on the tight end Richard Rodgers well maybe they will get to their average well that one's not accepted and all it does is bring up fourth down with scrolls waiting so chief Kelly not pulling anybody out of this game even Darren Sproles who is waiting for the and picked up at the 5yard line it was Jenkins who got in there Raymond was out to block it but he wasn't alone that was a complete breakdown in blocking for the punter Tim maste that's the second one he's had blocked well that was a jailbreak just a you know right in the middle straight shot the reaction here at Lambo is for the score being posted with the Cardinals beating the Lions 14 to 6 and so they know their packers are tied at the top of the NFC North as this one is wrapping up under three to go Sanchez takes over at the five hands off pulled a hamstring during camp just not getting healthy and getting an opportunity lately a Jayhawk on the stop that by the way is the third punt blocked by the Eagles this season in Dave fifth comes in as the special teams coordinator with the number one rated special teams across the NFL well we saw the big return by a special team June for the Eagles in the backfield is pulled by Josh Boyd and Al awesome today what this is going to be a real disappointment for Philadelphia with this kind of field position they're not able to punch it in here against the Packers through Packers with this kind of lead yet defensively they're still holding up doing a heck of a job try to keep these Eagles from scoring twominute warning here at Lambeau Field in Green Bay fiftythree to twenty a thirty three point game two minutes left third down and goal for the Eagles after the block punt Bryan brandman Blanca to set up this opportunity Sanchez to his right class Brad Smith off his hands now fourth down and goal this is a good throw yeah really good throw Brad Smith with an opportunity guy who's had limited action at the wide receiver position but one that he definitely should have caught and of course Philadelphia going for here on fourth down say it with some conviction they're obvious feel the bad angle taking over on downs as Barrington came up to make the play the Green Bay Packers I understand that going for it on fourth down I quite understand this call from the fiveyard line with great field position the Eagles are unable to do anything with it and the Packers hold Billy what was already a frustrating night that just adds to it the Green Bay will take over with Flynn they'll run out the clock they will officially in moments be seven and three same for the Eagles and that means that the Eagles will be tied with Dallas the top of the East and the Packers will be tied with the Lions the top of the central the North rather and with that game that happened out in Arizona further solidifying their spot as the number one seed in the NFC the Arizona Cardinals at nine and one yeah in Arizona has wins against the Philadelphia Eagles and the Dallas Cowboys and so they're in a great position but a big win here by Mike McCarthy and this Green Bay Packer team against the Philadelphia Eagles I think what we learned from it is you don't want to play Green Bay here at Lambeau this year no 50plus points in consecutive games the first time in franchise history on the other side you've got the Eagles 53 points allowed today is the most by Philadelphia since 1972 against the Giants and we're under a minute to go and there's not one NFC contender for a playoff spot that wants any part of having to come here to Green Bay in the month of January to play Aaron Rodgers and the Packers here at Lambeau yeah I agree with that night but you know what I think it's true even on the road Joe I think this team got off to a slow start to start the year but they're hitting their stride they're getting better on defense offensively they're playing with a great deal of confidence at Lambeau on the road this team starting to peak yeah that slow start was a one and two start and that man Aaron Rodgers said to the Packer fans and there are millions of them relax it was for the most part relax today running it up a win for the Packers we'll be back after this",

  "transcript": "Doosan after a very quiet start as you pointed out donovan mcnabb is a very effective one game of the Saints opening up the passing game for Drew Brees something that's rare for the New Orleans Saints something we haven't seen so effective and that's the run game being balanced with the passing game drew Brees being in the league now for a while understands how can you take pressure off of me that's by marking or picking up big yards two touchdowns today you know in the Brandt area of Ben Watson and also lowering their fullback but you also got to give credit to their deepest I talked about in the beginning I thought they needed to apply pressure get off for a third down three turnovers and they've done that now they need to do it in the second half to secure the win Steelers first three drives went 3834 and 62 of them ending on field goals but their last three ends in a three and out on interception and then a Miss 54 yard field goal try the final play the first half the best game on defense the Saints have played in a long time but a full half to go cadet and up to the 25 let's check in downstairs with charissa Thompson thank you sir you happy as you can imagine headed into the locker room I asked you know what he can do to sort of temper that momentum that the Saints had because I don't care what they're doing we cannot leave many the points on the field that we've been doing we got to convert we know what we need to do conversely for Sean Payton as you guys mentioned he only had two first downs through the first quarter and a half obviously got it going with that run game he was on the road we have got to stick with that that set up the playaction biggest message for him at finish it's going to thing all year long they've got to do guys within the eight best rushing team in the NFL so far this year and they give at Ingram on first down tripped up by Hayward a gain of two this first gonna have to find a way to establish the bar in this room to compete to get foot clog up the hole is a little bit too Forge Mark Ingram to start going east and west a set of North and South but I'm interested to see now that this passing office from the New Orleans Saints Jimmy Graham has not received a catch yet you know so if they get him involved in this offense it opens up more for everyone else and tight ends have carved up this Steeler defense this entire year that's made by posting up to the 33 years long will bring up third down and short when you're in the huddle do guys come back getting a sense frustration at all are you calling them beatless Tom now hey these receivers together they get frustrated they'll come back and say hey I got him just give me an opportunity what the quarterback we're not gonna force the ball because when you boards the ball it creates turnovers now I'm sure the defense like Ike Taylor and most of these betters I started to talk to Jimmy and Jimmy start to get frustrated but he's got to look back and understand what the team's going long dead before it ever started timeout Pittsburgh first team timeout a 30second timeout so I want to throw down to begin this second half Steelers are spending a timeout you know Donovan it doesn't matter whether you're playing in that NFC South where every team has seven losses we brought up or the AFC North where every team has seven wins both these teams are fighting to get in the playoffs they're very very much in it so every game the rest of the way is a big one every game is important and I know everyone hears that it's like a cliche but when you look at the Saints you know if they continue to win they will win their division I think the same goes for the Pittsburgh Steelers they've got the Baltimore Ravens and they've also had the Cleveland Browns who are playing well right now so every game is important and then when you go into the playoff you want to make sure you're playing at that hot huh Saints will get another track of both Carolina and Atlanta Steelers have two games against offenders down vote may have been tipped it looked like it was tipped no short of the intended receiver he's got to find the lane he's he had one there but great job there by Haywood of being able to get his arm up which almost could have led to another first down this offense is struggling on third down to this game really both sides of the ball have struggled it's going to come down to who can convert more third downs at a Liberty say hey words fell all over the field he is the one member of the state of defense it has showed up today that ones belong dead preserve the pot we will reek ick the ball is the officials weren't in position to officiate the play still fourth down that might be the first I've ever heard of that you know for a lot of these referees is important they get in position but you know if you're not in position then why put the ball down you put the ball down as an offense in special teams of defense we're ready to go so that's just a bad bad play call it homage to say bad assessment by the referees and look like Antonia Brown to return to let's get in there and Brown again a lot of feel to the 20 beautifully by the Saints only a junior returned by Antonio Brown you look inside the Western PA sports museum celebrating the rich tradition of sports here in this region it's all about football on some days here first down baby on bail a couple of yards now you continue to ask the question after Ben Roethlisberger followed through and made contact with Curtis Walton injuring his right hand is he's still being affected by that well I think he is being effective but you know when you get an injury like that you get out of relevancy but you begin to lose their face and that being your lower body and forbid they start throwing the ball all upper body but as a quarterback you got to get back into rhythm in order for this seem to be effective and he's in rhythm it'll be right where they need to be first down great play call by Todd Haley and that's ways of hitting your quarterback in rhythm easy throw hit your kite is hit your receivers at six yards now that confidence continues to rise while offensive lines start to jump off on their defender and receivers get more pushed so that none of the throws are a lot easy to get yeah yeah Marissa Thompson again checking with the medical staff of the Steelers and they say this bozo and intercepted by Tamron so so here the Saints come into Pittsburgh having not intercepted a pass and over a hundred attempts and they have two of them the last three Steeler possessions take a look a great job here by Cameron Jordan being able to come up field and not only that but get your hands up you gotta get your hands up silly's give you your secondary a chance that was the big question talking to Sean Payton basically what he said was as the defensive line we need to get more pressure on the opposing quarterback because our secondary has been in for in trouble because they have been covering for over four seconds career interception then they give it to England he's down to the 11 yard line what a turnaround by this Saints defense I mean they will really kicked around these last couple of weeks especially in the run game against Jeremy hill and the Bengals two weeks ago for set and the Ravens last week on Monday night right and they have come to play here to Pittsburgh the team that's been averaging 35 a game at home touched it welcome to my channel the outside as a quarterback you want to take what the defense gives me just a three step drop to a six yard route that's just a great job on tooms part of breaking away from Ike Taylor and then forcing himself into the end zone big question if he got in there you know Mike Tomlin I'm sure is looking at that right now if you landed at the one with his elbow they may call this one back well they're taking a look at it as they do every scoring play and every changeup as we will review the previous part if it stands for tune it would be his first career touchdown touchdown reception under review after reviewing the play the ruling on the field stands is touchdown no we're talkin Mike Pereira during the commercial break in a timeout unless there's definitive evidence that some part of that ball did not break the flame before the elbow went down they're not going to overturn it you know it's shocking because you see the elbow go down first which is a bangbang d and which is tough you know and only an instant replay will you see that but I thought they would have reversed it but understanding why they kept it as a touch downs and it wasn't definitive but you know great job there with Mike who are always doing an excellent job Nicktoons a had high expectations for this young man when he came out of Wisconsin of course his daddy was some kind of football player the great out tune for many years for the New York Jets inactive for all but two games tonight his third game of the year and at 11 games in his career only seven catches you know you see them starting to emerge a little bit in this offense you know just a couple weeks ago you start to pick it up me and Kenny Stills both but there's a comfort level with Drew Brees in after it's good started with a ship called the interception by Jordan Roethlisberger the Steelers looking for answers we're talking about the Saints do not have an interception on defense in a hundred and twelve passing attempts not carried into this game today and now all the sudden they've intercepted walfish Berger twice in his last eight attempt two touchdowns off two takeaways and a 21 to 6 lead who saw this coming not me I tell you when you think of the Saints you always think of hurt on the road that they struggle well today you know the struggling on third down but they're still capitalizing on the opportunities and if that's the tribute of them just a team to work at it and we'll see what happens with Pittsburgh is has so many chance have to take advantage here this late night at his in zone have a big 41yard return early in the game not this time drop another return and the 16 one Ronald Powell's well we have nearly an entire half to go 21 to 6 the numbers on waffles burger are not good I mean this is a guy his last two home games set an NFL record throwing 12 touchdown over the two games yeah and then he saw the brother of Rob Ryan then he ran into Rex Ryan in New York with the Jets and it was held to just one touchdown you know just talking to Ben about that claim you know Rex Ryan now playing Rob they're very similar you want to be able to get them in long cadence so you can show their hand and see what blisters they're doing to make it easier in the office but he's got to take advantage of these opportunities here able to buy a couple of extra yards I'm pretty good gained in the twenty again of almost four and I think this is something now you look at the way that they've been playing you gotta find a way to kind of you know boost a little energy into this offense why not go no huddle beer you know go no huddle get bin and getting back in command where he's spreading them all around hitting the intermediate passes with his receivers and the rhythm is there utilized the run game with lady on Bell to set up that playaction downfield lady first down up to the 32 the v1 tried to pull the trigger once to dig Vince you know he took a look downfield and and Antonio Brown decided to check it down to lay beyond bell which is a great option has been a big option for him this year whenever you have man versus lady on bail it works out in your favor this young man has continued to improve and it show not only can he run the football but he also the formal receiver out of the backyard while Bell goes to the sidelines he just said an alltime Pittsburgh record for receiving yards by a minivan conceived the rookie three Archer is in there and that is a gate of nain on first down see it a different type of offense here you start out by running the football with Le'Veon Bell you want to take a shot downfield Antonio's brown second back down to lay beyond Bell in the passing game and who else do you go to to keep things flowing your security blanket get it to Heath Miller and give him an opportunity move on now you're back into that rhythm that we've seen over the last couple weeks yeah we'll go we got Archer they will be out of Kent State at the line of scrimmage and denied first down yardage by Hawthorne I would imagine this he fell right back in there and yep here he comes along with Johnson and an extra tied in and Spain on third down and one well you just get the feeling ranted nine minutes to go in the third quarter but the Steelers really need this first down they really do it again from where they started in the rhythm that we've seen you know this is one what you think okay now we're just going to run the football pounded get the first down you put some every week after week we starting to see him pass the ball now on third and short and the Saints won a timeout you all right talked about Roethlisberger to left with two times on the home turf beyond belief very different game here today third down in the yard the second effort may have gotten the job done may have gotten it done by Bell excellent piece of running right there by lady Jung Belle then we were to allout blitz bringing everyone up oh you saw that by a bad spot right there I mean that is right at the 45 yard line and they're saying first half great job while leaving bells just putting his head down and driving his legs to pick up those extra yards they had unblocked defenders in there to make the tackle just not able to bring him down fiftyfifty such a devel and he's up to midfield you heard several players not only the quarterback say alert alert alert what might that mean I know you don't run their offense a zonie most of the time when you hear quarterbacks call them to learn if they have a four week or four strong if you're running the football to the strong side and you know that you can't block the fourth defender you want to now bring it over to the left side which or the weak side they may caught it from the formation so right now you hear them calling fifty being the Mike linebacker it starts there and if you feel like you're getting blood somewhere else and I change the play who says he's getting too old to move pretty nifty footwork right there Roethlisberger coming into this season talking to him just yesterday said he he were finally worked out with a trainer for the first time in his career he found out when he when you get older you need to change some things up got with a nutritionist start to work a little bit more on his footwork and obviously his balance and you're starting to see it a little bit now I'm just wondering when he'll be able to utilize it a little bit more because now that puts more pressure on the defense knowing that he'll be able to do that right there incomplete Lofton and coverage we check in with Joe Glen back in Los Angeles Tom we go to Tampa Bay and insulting down 10 7 finds AJ green beautiful catching in some 14 10 bangles first lead of the day they're looking to stay on top and the AFC North back to Pittsburgh Tom Donovan and Carissa tell you one thing about Andy Dalton he will make some vengal fans crazy there's no doubt about that but 3 years in a league is a starter three years in a row to the playoffs his numbers ranked amongst the best that have done it and also they've kept keep an eye on catch me down to the third you can rest assured everybody around this town is keep an eye on Andy Dalton too because those two teams will to live next week absolutely and they're also paying attention probably to about that San Diego Baltimore game just to keep an eye on that one ball even so I just think for the Pittsburgh Steelers at this point you got to take care of what's there for you the New Orleans Saints are here right in front of them if they could either drive and finish this off for the touchdown it's going to do wonders for this football team Tony tenth play the drive field he'd be horn in coverage and that's the first down to the 18 yard line you talk about how the wall of the struggled over the last couple weeks you know covering Titian's covering running backs before a guy like laid me on bail when you look up and see Hall floor covering 101 versus your running back Levin Bell you have to take full advantage of it just in this drive alone labium bells caught a couple passes Heath Miller is called a couple passes and receivers really haven't been involved in the drive no so you have to continue to attack it so now when you get to solve coverage on the outside you can utilize your receiver play number 11 on this drive for the Steelers clock sake misty be a gun behind both Picaro and often in the back to the end zone you know if you take a look here great route running by Heath Miller just kind of stumbled a little bit would it end up being a touchdown but again did the linebacking crew from the New Orleans Saints you talk about Hawthorne you talking about lofted those are the guys you got to attack it just in this drive alone I mentioned in last last sit last play that that's the weak spot of that defense right down the middle with Darius bird being out at the same position you've got to continue to attack him but any loss Raphael Busch his replacement they've got the air war in his second straight start I'm trying to step it out of there man Antonio Brown flag is down on the play the penalty looks like it made me against the world and somewhere in the secondary helical you say hands hands to the face number 29 pecans the penalties define your junkie to play first down waves out when you get a cover to look right here the middle of a field is where you want to attack I talked about their safeties and their safeties have not been effective in this game and why not go to your security blanket which is Antonio Brown the best wide receiver hearty we probably in the NFL at this particular point look at his numbers and the way he had been have been playing you have to put him amongst the top two oneeighty both men on the field defense prior to the staff after this today so it goes from just outside the one to inside the one and words back and forth that appears Shawn paintin wanting to know from Ryan what's going on nothing everybody's trying to know what's going on yeah see this has been ongoing for weeks for these teeth you know you look at this defaced messing up off that's not going well they need a lot of hate ball here utilizing speed around that corner opened up being able to utilize the speed getting around that corner the great south diving you take a look here pull back coming to lead that leave the hole no hole wide open this take it to get just utilize the speed get to the pylon beat the defender there which ended up being a big time touchdown for that's only the third rushing touchdown by Bell in fact until he scored a rushing touchdown in the win against Tennessee late in the game that was the Steelers first rushing score in 31 quarters when they get it here to get right back in it Roethlisberger mighty good on that drive 2113 our aerial coverage today provided by nationwide first touchdown scoring drive of the game for the home team 13 plays 83 yards Roethlisberger hitting on 5 of 7 for 65 of the 83 to get and out across the 20 penalty flag comes in late during the return holding number 35 the receiving team Kenya penalty yourself first time is cloud in Pittsburgh has come to life after the Steelers score a touchdown and the Saints backed up after the penalty on first down from the 1112 enough to anger about it he has stood up by Jason worlds no games maybe a loss of the yoi you look at this defense and you know drew brees having an opportune to spread the ball around haven't been so effective when it comes to third down performance but first and second down you got to be impressed with running the football and dinking and dunking to these receivers and also to the running backs to get it in somewhat manageable third down situation the grandmas standing on the sidelines he does not have a catch today of that not even thrown two grand Steelers have really mix it up in coverage on him today Boston Graham they made up for in Kenny Stills you know if you take a look at this round he had kidney stills as well as tool wide open in the middle of the football field don't know if there was a miscommunication there with the linebackers they decided to come with pressure but the linebackers are fake he's had to fill the void and right there they left the the middle of the field wide open with two and just left right there on the head kitty still yes to a reception 75 villains reaching around like that ball might be loose and Keisel will walk off with an injury he is in tremendous pain his Brett Keisel heading back to the Steeler sideline when I could maybe a shoulder injury there can't lose the big fella sheared the beer they need him in there step four step one of his Jason whirls world to back up to James Harrison and Lamar Woodley his first three years in the league that eight sacks his first time as a starter a year ago with keys was hurting you got a really they're really thin at the you talk about I think I can't I'm sick we'll take a look here this is the big play here skills raise to the inside they got behind nine tailors playing for the first time since September after breaking his arm and twice long completions behind Taylor and this one a 69yard store run a double move here on Ike Taylor out none I slipped their horn on the big defense a great job here by Drew Brees but it all starts up front you're not able to go through this wreath because it takes a while double boo look at that horseshoe right there brings out by the offensive line giving Drew Brees time to peruse the defense and find the open man and usually when you have that it leads to something big like this well they're gonna take a look so a few of the Steelers on a sideline pointing into sideline as though stills had stepped out of bounds but no indication of that now point after a drive by Shayne Graham Omega 28 to 13 how about that for an answer for Drew Brees at a Saints deception after the Baltimore game this is the way to respond you get it get back and you see in their plan that zone defense great job Sean Payton dialing up here's Kenny Stills running a double move offensive line buying time for Drew to get and keep his eyes downfield and Kenny still is just doing a wonderful job finishing his fourth catch for 144 yards I tell you we talk so much about Jimmy Graham well sometimes when you're in the in their offense and out their information to their TT me it allows others to elevate their game and make big plays like this most hundred forty full receiving yards and Donovan talked about a career high for stills Johnny might have Oklahoma in the fifth round a year ago father I think also was a professional athlete who you know obviously put some wisdom into his young man and prepare to me left school early came out and really found a home here in New Orleans drew Brees spoke highly of them great route runner we've seen how effective he was in college and now he's showing that he can play on the professional ranks stills had a good game and I lost a Baltimore en8 catches a careerhigh 98 yards Taylor we mentioned coming back for the first time since he broke his arm in September Steelers really felt like they were gonna get a look at what their defense is all about today with so many guys healthy that have been out for a while a couple of others who still not done his second good return of the day at one 441 yards in this one okay 25 leak 13 continues later on CBS and for some of you as well on Fox big one for the Cardinals and the Falcons and later tonight on NBC tomorrow night on ESPN a couple of guys heading to Canton Ohio one day when their careers are over and you see the numbers today Brees outdueling Roethlisberger the slaw confusion on the defense for the Orleans yeah yeah smooth fail 27 yard line the great job right there we've been being able to utilize pillow lady ops out here working the inside of the route linebacker Hawthorne again covering having to covered man man to man versus Le'Veon Bell great job getting up field if he would have got one more block by Antonio Brown may have ended up in the end zone for rare long reception for lay beyond bill that one at 48 yards in an injured Saint is all the way back into 15 that's Akeem Hicks talked about all the injuries both of these defenses Saints last week loss roderick buckley they've already lost bird and bush at safety glenn foster benny Sunseri and other safety and of course the receiver Brandin cooks let's check in downstairs with charissa you guys are talking about all these injuries unfortunately for the steelers breakfast L is doubtful to return with a left tricep injury medical staff kept trying to come up to him and didn't really want any part of that Mike Tomlin wrapped in mop he seemed okay but I'm getting the report that he's doubtful to return all right charissa Thompson thank you very much Steelers try to call me right back scoring a touchdown their first touchdown on their last possession Saints need five plays to answer that score going across his body to the end zone and it's incomplete you know here we had a naked bootleg you know he tried to come across it possibly get wheaton across the across the field didn't have him but he had Antonio Brown standing over it wide open on the right sideline you know sometimes as a quarterback it's this is not what you do you don't throw the fall across the field because it could end up being a turnover but sometimes you got to take a shot oh ho Oh run there Jordan now the intercepts are legit bands would set up the Saints touchdown well form especially in this game you know you look at something two takeaways in the last four weeks he's had one takeaway and today he's found himself over to Ben Roethlisberger for a couple sacks and an interception so this is one of which you know it could be a breakout game here for Camden Jordan but they'd have to find a way to finish they struggled on the lastminute fencing game in false start number 73 offense fiveyard penalty remains third down well known foster to left going right there yeah you know you're in trouble with the first person you look at is the referee when you flinched you telling on yourself all right so third and nine backs about five to third and 14 they will want to play reporter bug shaping up to be an exciting finish 28:13 Saints in front back after a word from your local Fox station set to begin the fourth quarter here in Pittsburgh by and large this crowd has really been quieted by fruit breeze and the Saints breathe with four touchdowns today has not thrown an interception voted out at 14 little did roethlisberger if he catches that ball it's the first down yeah but he had to leave his feet it might have been about 2 2 yards Jordan you know Ben's been a little off today I mean to say the least of you know some of his balls here his base is too wide he's forcing it using all upper body this isn't a Ben Roethlisberger we've seen definitely he's playing at home you know over the last couple weeks what what they said sure this game is close enough so if he happens to get back in rhythm quickly he'll put up a great chance of winning 47yard field goal tried by suiza skies become automatic but it's somewhere between 50 yards in 28 in a row from that district Cameron Jordan create a big turnover here missing attack a wee bit too being able to explode until the end don't have been here lady I'm Mel capitalizing to get back in the endzone the Mickey close and on the defensive end just giving up Ike Taylor getting be here by Kitty still its lead to the big time touchdown way to take a look at our game and summaries we're just under way here in the fourth quarter in Pittsburgh told you about Drew Brees four touchdowns no interceptions very efficient a struggle for Ben Roethlisberger you wonder when he hit his hand on Curtis Lofton on a throw in the first quarter if it had anything to do with really some missed opportunities with some missed receivers in this game today you know what I would say it had it's done wonders for the New Orleans Saints because now they can just bring pressure up the middle and force bid to try to get off his spot and get outside the pocket before the Pittsburgh Steelers it's kind of pulling back a little bit because they want to run the football but in order to run the football and be balanced you have to be effective throwing the football he's inaccurate he's kind of wavering of where he wants to go with the football he's indecisive and so for Ben Roethlisberger I think it's important they get back on the sidelines maybe talk to Todd a little bit about getting back to the basics of the office the three step to fiveseven get the ball out of my hands a little bit to make sure the defense kind of soften so now start to run the football more and set up to get over the top maybe with its O'Neal brown or possibly weak and you brought it up that's really how they they got it going last week I mean this is a Steeler team or two weeks ago they had last week off they were down 11 points in the fourth quarter on the road in Tennessee and a rally to win that game by three we're gonna need a fourthquarter rally here today to get out of the end zone he has stopped light at the 20yard line well many NFL athletes grew up playing in communities all across this great country of ours and now through NFL play 16 they're encouraging kids and neighborhoods everywhere to come out and play for 60 minutes a day how about that visit NFL rush calm slash play 60 to learn more get off the videogame and get out run around a little bit I say that I mean what happened to recess what happened to get nothing and having fun king of the hill maybe play a little flag football by then these kids need to get outside and get active where's dad I get it today the Agena 3 nearly 4 negra mousse first three years in a league is not have been talked about earlier you know as sharing carries in sharing playing time when he was healthy enough to play frequently injured they have Pierre Thomas and Chris Ivory and Darren Sproles among others he's already surpassed by far his number of rushing attempts this year than the average of his first three years in the same holds true in rushing yards they're leaning on him hard right now playaction when breeze is just picking his defense apart Josh Hill back up tight end up to the 40yard line again you know we talked about the runner Mark Ingram and how effective he's been in this office this is what happens when you run the football that way now you start to get a little man coverage you got linebackers like spence covering this back up tied in you want to question now if your New Orleans man where's Jimmy Graham well with Jimmy Graham now you're rotating different guys Katie still stepping up Nicktoons stepping up now we have he'll also go in the sand so look for for this Saints team to back get back to running the football jimin's the first one their worlds was there as well they'll give worlds a sack you know sometimes off the support natives get too cute and this is right here this is what you've been defined as being too cute you need to run the football you need to get back to establishing the run game they went winning out enough you know there was covered so they went with another double move on both side mirror droughts they end up doing a great job in the secondary which led to Drew Brees holding the football entirely too long and standing on the sidelines on a second and 17 is Graham picked it up catch my stills they are saying that is a reception for a first down again in front of Taylor unbelievably the yards continue to pile up for stills that's a great catch right there about a young man what are they saying now incomplete yeah that that right there is a kid ball went through his hands hit him right and write him in the legs in the breast basket and he was able to corral it Sean Payton we'll find out at the end and he'll probably get this first down New Orleans is challenging the ruling on the field that the pass was complete so then out on the field is an in completed pass Sean Payton challenges and and while they take a look will step aside Brees under pressure there took the look from Kalamata will see him he completed the second in 17 all right we get the call after reviewing the play the ruling on the field is a catch ball be placed on the 49 yard line New Orleans will not be charged a timeout or invalid it's interesting there Michael looked like one official set in completion another official said completed pass how do they make the decision on what the actual call is on the field well whoever stands the firmest but usually it's the negative that wins out and that's the incomplete pass but you saw really here that the ball never touches the ground and that's what they looked for got control with the right hand and then the left knee hit twenty before he rolled bond so good solid reversal we think Mike Ferrell back in Los Angeles all first down and a run that he woulda lost a yard ham Thomas chasing him down as we close in on the 12minute mark 12 points of spread you know it's interesting you know you you sit around you talk about game planning and boy you gotta stop this guy if you've got to beat him if somebody would have told you Jimmy Graham did not have a single catch with 12 minutes to go you'd say the Saints are in trouble goes to show not necessarily the case because he doesn't have a check and they got it going on right now they've grown to the 44yard line coming up or Pierre Thomas something your boy yeah Pierre Thomas in there is a great quotation right now that was here Thomas's third rush of the games coming in fresh on the sidelines able to give mark Ernest Ingram an opportunity to rest a little bit Jimmy Graham came into the game obviously draws a lot of attention any time he's lined up in the formation if it's a tight end and slot Macedo or even split out wide by himself so here don't throw it down again this is one that they have to clean up having been effective but this is important paper down 47 yard line there is a penalty flag however in the secondary holding holding number 41 defense fiveyard penalty automatic first down let's antoine blake who is filling in for the injured place mccain from earlier in the game he had his hands all over Morgan pens Williamson would be sacked not to be for an automatic first down at the Pittsburgh 37 good something at the bottom for all season dropping a lot of laws you know Marques Colston it's rare I got to get back on strike I tell you they needed that play to keep this thing a lot especially coming off the big penalty to get the first down inside the 20 out of bounds inside the 10 down to the 7 yard line doing some pushing and shoving down along the morning a lot of guys get people separated but now a few more often get tangled up officials handle that beautifully see what happens here looks like Mitchell grabs ahold of Ingram's facemask them to hit by Taylor Robinson came in Morrigan shoving taylor had bucked the other way it's just an excellent job by marking room here exploding finding the hole and utilizing the speed to get to the corner is something we've been talking about he's got a hundred yards rushing you know he's carried this streak on of a hundred yards in play was over personal foul defense captive conditioning a goal automatic first down when he could have gotten Ike Taylor actually twice on that plea could have got in for the hit once Ingram was out of bounds and then certainly for the headbutt on Morgan although Morgan had shoved him to started but that's the only thing they saw what I think would the flag was thrown when Ben Watson then came over I think it was you know one of the defensive line but they can't come over it got physical really cute flag on him timeout called by New Orleans with 1029 to play yeah you Donovan you played this game and played it so brilliantly for for so many years five times leading your Eagles to the NFC championship game and once to a Super Bowl and you know it doesn't matter how long you watch any sport but especially this year in the NFL just when you think you have it figured out and here we are the Saints a lose three in a row enough where they never lose Steelers have been on nearly unbeatable at home and New Orleans has dominated this game after the first quarter it's funny you bring it up talking to Mike Tomlin talking to Mike Taylor Brigg he's all the veterans they looked at it in the sense of you know don't be fooled by the four and seven record this is a team that's strong on offense they're also defensively they can make plays so now make sure you guess what stay prepared and treat it just like their undefeated football you got to come out and give all the to have Saints have scored on four of their last five possessions five by the six on a touchdown to Colston this has been the kind of performance today the the Saints envision when this season began you know this is just a great job of Drew Brees just recognizing going against Antwon Blake who recently had the the penalty the holding penalty against the goal which is six for wide receiver Marcus Colston throw a jump ball back shoulder however you have to throw it to make him compete for the past Marcus Costa he dropped the ball about three plays before comes back the finish digs off the right way what a combination they have been Brees who Nolan hosts in the 250 second pick they both came in oh six that's his 66 touchdown connection six best of all time what a performance it has been today by this New Orleans Saints team and you say team team they've done it on offense sounds five of their last six possessions started very ugly today first quarter really first quarter and a half no we had two first downs and all of a sudden breeze is throwing five touchdowns without a turnover look at 40 this weekend Oregon already beaten by Arizona their only loss this year trying to get into that Final Four as his ohio state that'll be the Big Ten title game on Saturday night seven o'clock Eastern right here on Fox here Steelers are down 35 1610 and 22 to go it's no huddle time this is what you need to get on the mark and get things going quickly Pittsburgh's be very effective when they don't know how to you know expect the intermediate shots you know to come between the tendon 8yard your completions have been set up a big play laughing to the 27th one looks like a holding there by Lofton he was holding number 15 defense penalties decline results the plays of first athlete that's an automatic first down don't know what coach Tomlin was barking about there but 5yard penalty automatic for South perhaps he knew exactly what he was talking about what you want to get the completion also add five yards to it so we're gonna give give a good first down but again this is what you have to do you have to attack the middle of the football field versus these linebackers if it's your running back think we should tie it in the slot defend whatever may be you have to attack down another little bit go for a first down tentative 36 yard line Brown getting his catches today fly reception 77 yards but it hasn't been that backbreaking reception today as it's been seemingly every week this year well that's because they haven't been a rhythm it and if you take a look here I mean you get a couple two pleases secretaries just gonna soften up keep everything in front they don't want to give up the big play behind the safety so yeah you'll you'll get about eight nine catches in a game like this because of that but they needed those explosive plays in the second quarter they need them in the early in the third quarter you know now it's just trying to play catchup and you're not allowed to get behind Donavan just referred to as potential nini make a catch again nine that one dropped never had it cleanly and that's rare for Heath Miller to jump all like that but expect him to go right back to that they're playing the same coverage the whole way through so just go take your dick it dunks over the football baby out in the edges of the slot and he's in the 46yard line will bring a third and ten you begin to wonder watching this Pittsburgh steel their offense of winning with at least take another shot downfield I know that they're playing the two high safeties in here this look here you got single high safety this is what you want to be able to get over the top but on third down you got to get the ball out quickly because you know you get it right and once more an interception chance for Patrick Robinson it's incomplete and Steelers they have to go for yes you know Mike Tomlin and Ben Roethlisberger understood each other there you have to go for it you got to find a way to get back into this game and putty is just not gonna get it done but for Ben Roethlisberger you can't keep double clutch in and double pump it in the pocket because now you're gonna start the force throws with the lead to turnover so he's got to get back in rhythm find a way to get this first down to keep the chains moving plus she gets it get to that first down marker is Marcus wish for this is going to be very close and remember that's a fourth down catch and they're gonna bring out the chains for a measurement great effort there by Wheaton out you can see how far he is but by the time they start grabbing a hold on watch that be right there yeah that that's the only problem you know I think if even if they were moley if they're good here I think Sean Payton probably would throw the flag first town I'm a Peyton here he says not a chance and he looks to be correct well again let's see where the ball is when that knee does hit the ground New Orleans is challenging on the ruling on the field the pittsburgh did not make the winder game Payton is challenged and won once already today I look at the pound there the little pound for Rob it's not alright after reviewing the play the runner was down to 45 yard line first down New Orleans New Orleans will not be charged a timeout since they've won ciao not even close you can read the lips of Rob Ryan's it's feeling good huh well I'd say what I mean you know you talked about it going to break you see the knee down and bald knock that well first down redline marks now look here's four weeks left to go yeah after this game today and frequently the term is used and overused about you know facts against you and every cliche you can think up success the New Orleans Saints have had over the last number of years this truly was a game they needed to show up yes you look at their schedule the rest of the way they'll play at home against Carolina right go to Chicago big one against Atlanta they're all big then you go to Tampa Bay at the end of the year and you look at the Falcons going to Green Bay play the Steelers at home in New Orleans and Carolina what Zoe you want so it's safe to say that we think the the New Orleans Saints probably will be better I making it to the playoffs here fiveyard penalty remains second down you look at Carolina and that's a reigning Division champion ever since a loss Greg Hardy right very early this year they have not been this Orton girls their office attack he on the sides have retired their running back situation hasn't truly been healthy if not for cam dude with the aunt Louisa's Jonathan Stewart the defense hasn't been the same as far as getting off the field on third down the thing that I look at when it comes to New Orleans say if they play Atlanta twice that's a team they always rise for they play well against the Atlanta Falcons in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers probably watching their favorite big news food with the Cleveland Browns how about a joke flat that's right Tom we go to Buffalo boy your bench menzel in and he leads the Browns 80yard Drive takes it himself show them the money you know that's coming Johnny Manziel brings the Browns within 10 it's 20 to 10 Tom Donovan and parisa well I tell you what you talk about now quarterback controversy supreme well you better be ready for the Showtime if you gonna put Johnny Manziel in there and one thing's for sure though yeah Brian Hoyer gets struggling just last week even though we focus so much on Josh Gordon coming back and how effective he was in the passing game I believe that Brian Hoyer turned the football over three or four times in that claim and that's something you just can't do for football team that's trying to form and I did it and at the close race here with the Pittsburgh Steelers on me you got the Browns losing the Ravens are leading the Bengals are now by a single point in the play that are going to have in Tampa but the Buccaneers have the football back and here the Steelers are really getting run over I mean there's no other way to describe it so this just hasn't hasn't been what we've seen from the Pittsburgh steel especially playing late the season you go back to when they were eight date the last couple years and you wonder what was it or what could they bring in to get them over the hump well offensively Ben Roethlisberger's numbers have been great Antonio Browns numbers have been great labium Belle's numbers have been great they brought the old band back on defense well it just hasn't been the same defense that we've seen over the year they wanted to get back to playing physical football and that's something that I Taylor bring Keisel Mike Tomlin talked about and that's something they felt like you'd been missing from this football team well we haven't seen that today the late game Saints a really brought in the Pittsburgh Steelers of being physical by running the football being effective on playaction they haven't been great on on third down right now I think they're at 50% but it's still something to be said about how their plan most healers laying to play clock expire they'll take the penalty or call the time incites the other states allowed to to uh to get the penalty punt a lot of shaking heads on one side a lot of shaking hands and smiling on the other before today the only NFC South team to beat an AFC North team this year one time it happened and that was Tampa Bay stunning the Steelers here at week inflation made to Wheaton up to the 22 yard line here you have New Orleans gonna have minutes away from beating an AFC North team Tampa Bay with in field goal range in the final seconds trying to knock off Cincinnati yeah so you could have two of them in one day in the open field up to the 27 yard line and every man hurry up mode right now this is something I felt like they should have done a whole lot earlier for this to be effective get back in rhythm they do a great job in the nohuddle offices they can add Duncan and it's built for the quarterback Ben Roethlisberger to get into a rhythm like this well you know we talked about the Bengals there today was a game they figured there was a gimmick yeah look what they are facing over the final four Steelers twice they go to Cleveland and beat them already Denver comes into Cincinnati the Ravens on paper theoretically have the easiest schedule of the bunch Browns have divisional games against the Bengals and fall to Mary and they're talking about these Steelers playing the Bengals twice by Cameron Jordan the other tip pass and he's acepted a chip pass he's having a dog a day for Cameron Jordan you know this has been his day to possibly you know kickstart the later part of the season you know it was big question early on in the season of how they were gonna generate pass rush to get to the posing quarterback Gillette gets paid at the beginning of the season Cameron Jordan really hasn't been himself the last couple games he started to pick it up a little bit at this game he's dominating Miller for a first count close to me bastard holding number 68 offense 10yard penalty remains second down that'll be taken away on the holding fall against Kelvin Beecham one Gillette they're just mentioned you know the two guys Gillette being pain at the beginning of the season you know had a great game against Baltimore earlier on last week you know they're trying to bring more and more pressure if it's from Rob Ryan deciding to blitz blitz blitz a lot of times he's going allout blitz when you don't want him to but he's trying to get his secondary out of coverage so much they've been you know just been on the top of coverage you know posing offenses have been able to create that big play and now playing a team like this where they're playing pretty solid we'll see what happens next week burger is dropped by Jordan Mike having a bad day today I tell you you know every time you look up you see 94 somewhere around Ben Roethlisberger Gillette again coming around with a vs. Beecham but here just a straight up speed move being able to bull rush come inside Mike Adams getting being Cameron Jordan able to finish the play and speaking of finishing the play that's been part of the problem for the New Orleans things they haven't been able to finish games losing games in the fourth quarter I believe six or four to six times this year and that probably cost the wins step out of bounds at the 34 yard line Saints have blown six games this year where they had a lead as Jonathan mentioned four of them coming in fourth quarter of games coming face the basket personal foul grabbing the base mass number 74 defense 15yard penalty automatic first down that's glory white 24 4:01 to go starting empty out a little bit here at the stadium waiting for a dirtball football would definitely help I think some of the fans took it home with him we'll go to these cities just have such incredible plans it's gone plane flying in here I'm gonna be on the same flight with a lot of I'm assuming Steeler fans that were either you know out of town maybe during the Thanksgiving Day holiday and some of the Saints fans who were coming out Pittsburgh for the weekend and I mean that entire plane ride they were giving it back and forth to each other and then Donovan you played so many years not as many obviously inter conference games as intra conference games but could pull it great Father's both of these franchises have you talked about the New Orleans pelicans basketball team with Anthony Davis of an emergent said he's brought to that that city and then the football team winning the Super Bowl Pittsburgh here with Sidney Crosby and the Pittsburgh Penguins to now the stealer yeah you know so for a franchise like Merck still isn't also the New Orleans Saints it's a path is it so they look forward to this opportunity obviously for the Saints and also for the students are trying to move up in their division inside the ten first and last dealers you know it's so interesting when you look at seven a great quarterback two of them we have here today is that when it's flown up into the air and batted away beautifully defense by Robin you know totally surprising when you see some of the numbers when you're throwing for more than 300 yards there is a penalty flag by the way on the near side Eagle use the hands hands to the face number 28 defense fiveyard penalty or half the decision goal automatic first down you know oftentimes when a quarterback throws for over 300 yards saying a lot of fans all of a sudden assume that means it's been a good day that's more times than not not the case yeah you want to get those garbage numbers toward the end and that's what we're seeing right now from a bid and his wide receivers the same to me as said last week with New Orleans when they played Baltimore but he picked up and sees Drew Brees as numbers 11 22 berating you to thought they had a great chance in the game Roethlisberger today because of all these completions here the last couple of drives when the Saints are just giving them you know 8 10 12 yard throws it's his 34th career 300yard passing game the Steelers are one game under 500 when he throws for 300 or more it's about to go to 2 on either those are stats at the quarterback you don't want to hear you want to put up great numbers but you don't want to put up great numbers in go into the losing category I'll tell you for this Pittsburgh Steelers team it's about for them gives back to physical football and that's one of the football players wrong much bred into this New Orleans but merciless defense you know we see on the sidelines Rob Ryan and Tom Paine going back and forth but this is something to be said about how they're applying pressure from the defensive line they know that they're attacking their linebackers and safeties and they've been effective with the lady on bail and also Heath Miller but their corners their corners have played well Keenan Lewis also we talked about Robson who should have had to yesterday but they played well all day here looking for allout blitz fantasy football lovers would love that yep around 6:00 reception 90 yards they get now seven receptions for 94 touchdown sorry you're 20 successfully to Antonio Brown makes it 35 to 24 we take a look ahead next week the Fox NFL Sunday doubleheader America's game of the week mr. McNabb your longtime team the Philadelphia Eagles dominating the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving Day here on Fox now the defending Super Bowl champs come to town well you know what you go back to that Dallas is one thing that they made a point in it says it was stopping the run and they're stopping around with DeMarco Murray who held him under a hundred yards getting pressure on Tony Romo confusing them a little bit and they need to keep that same game plan versus Seattle try to hold Marshawn Lynch under a hundred yards and keep Russell Wilson in the pocket that means their ends they're gonna have to contain not get past Russell Russell Wilson keep them in that pocket stay physical on the outside and they've got a great chance of winning that game here on a day where Drew Brees has hit nine different receivers Saints have scored 35 points Brees has thrown five touchdowns and not one time all day as he thrown a pass to Jimmy Graham yeah unbelievable this might be the only time he catches a ball all day today onside kick now watch the ball go right to him sue the shortstop course he was a basketball player going back to his days of the Miami Hurricanes forward for four years following the footsteps of one Donovan McNabb for the Orangemen of Thundercat right there looking sexy explosive not only did you play basketball for Syracuse the woman great program senator Jim day I'm for 35 years whenever he's been there now you actually had a chance to be in uniform and were there for the national championship game against Kentucky yes I was there if you take a look at the highlights I was third seat from the end with you and hung up the head trainer down low I was a phenom when he came to warmups and also at halftime hitting threepoint baskets but you know what it was a great run in the believe in Kentucky it was a fun fun experience mr. Diaz you had a chance to go up against your former high school teammate yes who went on to Kentucky and later in the NBA for many years Antoine Walker yeah Antoine and aya is funny you know we we end up leaving leaving Mount Carmel High School in Chicago Illinois he and the Board of Kentucky I went to Syracuse played both sports at Syracuse just to watch the success that he had and I was so proud of him that game was his last game actually against us in the national championship game decided to go he was a lot of repeat in the NBA Draft playing with the boss himself to come years bending left there and won a championship in Miami but you know I was just so happy for him because he was a great player he was determined you know good things happen for him so long Carmel High School for all of you listening watching the game gets a great program in Chicago folks my friend Clancy in football I saw Taylor there shaking up again wrapped up here by Harrison but Taylor stays in the game as this will take us down to the twominute warning what a business trip that has turned out to be coming to Pittsburgh for the New Orleans Saints they have taken it light to Big Ben and the Steelers I got two minutes to go and the Saints trying to tie a ribbon around this one know that that trouble finishing agent what a better way to finish games just give it the marking room and just let him run I mean you look at the at the balance and Shawn pain to be the first to tell you know nine when they wanted all 2011 when they had a great year they lost in the playoffs you know both of those years they had the sixth best rushing offense in the NFL yeah and here this year they're up to number eight well we asked him the other day and I admired his honesty you know we I asked him I said I keep reading and hearing a lot of people say that there's something missing with your often right and he said there's no doubt about it he said you know you go back we had Reggie Bush for a long time we had a girl scrolls that home run hitter if you will and and that certainly has been something that they have been missing this entire year welcome so many of you watching from around the country alongside Donovan McNabb and charissa Thompson Mike Pereira Thom Brenneman our entire Fox crew here in Pittsburgh well I'm not sure anybody saw this coming Steelers on quite a roll coming in at 7:00 and 4:00 in the roughandtumble AFC North for every team at one seven games you know all about the NFC South early on Pittsburgh dominated the first quarter and a half but then the Saints over a six possession span scored five touchdowns to just run away and hide you know spread the ball around to nine different receivers and one of them not being Jimmy Graham you look at the effectiveness of the run game with what Mark Ingram the way the defense had been playing Cameron Jordan getting a couple sacks in this game to let Brian front row applying pressure the corners how they play Keenan Lewis as well as Robinson tip your hat off to this New Orleans Saints teams because they ready they came ready to play Saturday sure did then a good game to this guy lady on and he is hip by Vacarro and that draws a penalty flag personal foul late hit out of bounds number 32 defense by 15yard penalty automatic first down this young man's a solid safety in this league he came from the University of Texas Trent early draft pick by the New Orleans Saints and I've continued to just get better I thought what he and Jarius bird back there at the safety position they would be the best duo on the defensive end but jerry has suffered a seasonending injury which kept them out there by ourselves you know that was just another great way hard on the sleeve those things out of the tackle the knees inside a 49:38 as we're down to the final 40 seconds while the Bengals hung on in one there together by one in Tampa Bay so they go to eight three in one the Ravens are leading but they're still a minute 46 to go down when it's a title",

  "transcript": "weatherwise catching a break in Pittsburgh very cold during the week couple of Pleasant days on the weekend 57 degrees gametime temperature today Sean Payton's team loses a three in a row remarkably all at home against three very good teams of 49ers the Bengals and then last week against Baltimore meanwhile from Mike Tomlin 42 years young out of Newport News Virginia taking the Steelers to the playoffs four times three divisional championships but backtoback eight and eight seasons and they're starting to get a little antsy they're used to postseason football here in the Steel City only three bigtime coaches are played here and they've all had success I think when you think of my comment and what he's been able to do since he's been here two Super Bowl champions and then you look at also the report of a grin Roethlisberger has been a staple of this football team the face of the franchise and with Mike Tomlin they're looking for him to get back on track and this would be the year for the module Saints won the toss defer to get to the football in the second half bang tweeted back to the end zone by Thomas Morstan so here comes Big Ben 32 years old grew up in 40 Ross in Ohio has the league's fourth most passing yards a careerbest 68% of his passes he's completed and look at those numbers at home where the Steelers are averaging 35 points per game you know what when you look at this offense I've always said I think they need to get back to the old running style with the Jerome Bettis is but when you have lady in Bell you can not only get around the football effective you can test the ball out in the backfield so keep an eye on to see if they attack the run here to get the defense to show what they're going to do on the second year one of our business Steeler team offensively so many weapons fell in his second year out of Michigan State is there anybody by better so far this year at wide receiver than Antonio Brown not at all you know and that's to just a comfort level that he and Ben both have is something that they work on during the practice week and I think what's been being an older veteran in this game he understands you need a security blanket so it's not always the deep past watching the media maybe picked up three meanwhile for the New Orleans Saints defensively they were ranked number four overall and / here under rob ryan they have slipped all the way to 27 this year you know i look at this defense and it all starts up front and i think they're not winning did line of scrimmage you have to win a line of scrimmage battle and that's getting to the quarterback stopping the run they've been given up entirely too many big explosive plays in the running game and that leads to getting me in the third and medium third and short they need to force the seam to be back behind 11:30 third down has been so critical for this Saints defense and the Steelers will cash it on third down who else you talked about that security blanket and Tonio brown is NFL leading 89th reception in the last four weeks this young man has been targeted 49 times with 38 catches you can definitely tell the comfort level with Ben Roethlisberger look for all quarterbacks you want to spread the ball around get everybody involved to get the defense to understand we're not just going to our number one guy when you have a guy like Antonio Brown you find ways to put the ball in his hands the last chain weeks the Bengals and the Ravens were 18 or 26 think about that further 18 out of 26 successful rookie out of Clemson crosses midfield another steal their first down you know if you just take a look here Ben Roethlisberger doing an excellent job of showing ball to the linebackers can now commit and go right over the top to his wide receiver here when you have a wide receiver with the height of Brian you can just put it up let him go get it and then now just let them be an athlete and run through tackles great job by Ben Roethlisberger in this office boy for now couple of youngsters quiet and we have combined so far this year for eight touchdown receptions and he's down to the 40 Delta Li Bell coming off his best game in the NFL against Tennessee two weeks ago remember the Steelers had a bye week last week 204 rushing yards the fourth most all time in a game in Steeler history and the comeback came from really within running the football not only when you're down went off if you want to spread the ball around get the ball downfield get some quick strikes but they decided to run the football that's just the comfort level and also the maturation process that they have inlay nion bill about that shot of Blanco Harris for the Saints in leftist burger just throws it away beautifully by Keenan Lewis the former Steeler he could have just afforded two or three more seconds with that he asked so vo Brown going down the middle of the football field if you just take a look here great job by Antonio Brown selling the run getting up to the safety and creating separation to turn with Carl's hips that right there would have been an explosive plan had probably other this fanbase going crazy going even further down the second dos game opening drive this burger under pressure and Cory white nearly got it so the Steelers will putt you know what it's something to be said when the offensive line you know has to battle but give a little credit here to this defensive line Cameron Jordan coming off being able to get on the arm of Ben Roethlisberger to force a high pass which almost led to a turnover which would a would the other way Brad winter Hart ran one on the clock Jayla Saunders standing back at his own 10 yard line and over and and down to the 15th so when we come back we get a look at true freeze after a good start for this Saints defense we'll breeze and the Saints get the football for the first time today starting from their own 15 under heavy pressure right away he dumps it off send this to dependable over the last eight years and that would be Pierre Thomas and a first down on first down much has been made about the Saints playing on the road how do they play outside of the dome down in New Orleans those are not bad numbers for a quarterback in a career on the road this when you look at this offense you dig outside and bad weather conditions they got to run a football they're not a power running football team but we're marking of this year things are tape wrote again like a pretty good pass right there to Nicktoons who's been inactive for all the two games during this entire year baby games we got Robert Meachem 272 offense 10yard confit come on arms dead whistle for the penalty Pete Morelli our referee today in Pittsburgh you just take a look here you'll see the left tackle you know given car for holding something you said that we're talking to Mike Tomlin when he was talking about old Devo back meaning James Harrison you know in the pressure that he's been applying the last 12 weeks he's been quite impressive so keep an eye on that matchup going off throughout the whole day Alabama off to the 21yard line though Saints when you look at some of the numbers Donovan I mean they look really good second overall in offense but not scoring at the same rate they have in years past you know and that's the big talking to Drew Brees he wanted them to be a little bit more consistent in the red zone they have opportunities from their defense or possibly drives they're just not capitalized him and that used it at the other game have ended up hurting inside is to get this 33rd catch of the year it'll bring up a third down for New Orleans they put the old band back together defensively you know when you look at these these four guys I'll tell you it all starts with Ike Taylor getting hurt in the Carolina game he had been out watching some of these young guys develop talking to him yesterday he basically was impressed by what McCann and then Blake it would win able to bring to the table and dick LaVon has been the staple of this defense and I tell you they look at at Dick LeBeau as pop as they call them what an extraordinary career the Hall of Fame defensive coordinator the Steelers has had yet protection here Marcus Colston and right there step for step in coverage was Bryce McCain who continues to get more and more playing time in absence of Cortez Allen that's the whole thing right there great job of getting a hand on the bar and just distracting Marcus Colson Mike Thomas both highly applicant of what he's been able to do in hike Taylor's his absence but you know it's more to be said about this defense it's the next man up mentality and the confidence that they have in these guys stepping up to make plays and that right there at the fire we said just does get it away maybe sideline we'll see where they spot is right after 35 on that cut place McCain injured appear to be reaching for his right hamstring torso have more on that shortly first down carry by way beyond no we talked about it's not always play when you play but where you put right look at the NFC South every team with at least seven losses now because of the one headtohead game went by Atlanta over New Orleans week one they would all the tiebreaker but they have another game left who wants to win that thing you know that's the big question right now you look at Atlanta sometimes they show you something on offense but defensively they just don't have it in New Orleans same way so I think for that particular game that made a deciding game bellies up to midfield and have to steal at first down great job right here lady I'm belt with him spurred open by will Johnson their fullback being open up being able open up the whole lay down balance really impressed a lot of these coaches here including the players of just how he's continued to improve not only picking up the Blitz it which is important by running back but picking up those extra guards you need to keep the change movies tell a young man who grew up in Reynoldsburg Ohio just outside of Columbus was not recruited by Ohio State Michigan State understand why the Sparky's water to try and drag him down you know as something to be sad when a running back you know is delivering the blow getting his Tad's underneath the defender and being able to keep his legs moving it's about the drive and this young man takes you back to the old you know the old Jerome Bettis the bus you talk about Franco Harris all these strong running backs who have taken the pressure off of their quarterbacks and he's doing that this year for Ben Roethlisberger second most rushing yards in the NFL there's Franco they're having the 1974 reunion over this weekend in Pittsburgh that was the first Steeler team to win a Super Bowl Le'Veon Bell for maybe a yard and they'll head again for the first time today with Curt Menefee back in lausanne well since everybody in the Earth's and South is still in it Saints fans will like this Carolina down 7 nothing how are you doc will cool yard catch from Teddy Bridgewater and the Vikings have to be in a minus 7 degrees windchill Minnesota Tom and Donovan what'a all right thank you very much Kurt yeah ten plays five passes five rushes for the Steelers here on the move the second possession offense fiveyard penalty your name's first down got have been all of that going on with ben roethlisberger check us through what he's doing it the line of scrimmage what what you want to do is you want the defense to show their hands sort of speak now they're going to motion bringing it running back out seeing if a linebacker or a safety will go out to cover annoying to have man if they decide to do that right there they stayed in the zone and just like 'man lewis just kind of outflank to cover a guy like living in a bill but unfortunately you know kelvin beach of jumping offsides really mess things up will expect them to go back to that same formation to attack a little field play fake a little too tall for Marcus Wheaton he was opened down to the 20yard line so again Ben Roethlisberger and a great fake sticking the ball out showing the ball so linebackers can commit here it looked like he was trying to go inside but end up going to his third read which in Des Moines back sides with wide receiver just some high if he can bring that down to it of course in his game they're gonna be many opportunities in the passenger we only had six catches in his rookie tier a season ago he's closing in on 40 in this his sophomore year and it all Oh see outside number 94 defense fiveyard penalty remains fear death so rather than what third and 14 have become slowed down and nine Ben Roethlisberger doing a great job with the hard count to get Cameron Jordan to jump off sighs give yourself a free play you wished it was a past tag to that city's you possibly attack downfield look third down here just take a look and keep an eye on Antonio Bryant he's been hits guy excuse me Antonio Brown hit his guy on third down pocket collapses and Roethlisberger throws incomplete dragged down by junior galette you know Antonio Brown being his guide deciding now just to be a clear out route he had an opportunity outside but with pressure up the middle for any quarterback it makes the pocket tough you got to find ways to get the ball out of your hands this will be a lengthy field goal try for Sean and suiza loose hit on 18 out of 20 this is a 53yard war and officially this one from 49 that curves right there very very nice every now and again it's nice to have a slice in it a bubble you aerial coverage provided by nationwide sellout crowd and Pittsburgh Steelers trying to keep pace with the Bendel's the Ravens the Browns everybody in this AFC male with seven wins this year Brees back on offense trailing three nothing dealers have had the football triple the amount of time of the Saints but it's just a three nothing Steelers lead first down for the Saints in the 20 Mangrum has really been slowed down the last couple of weeks he have put together three straight 100yard rushing games let's check in downstairs with charissa Thompson thanks um well the Steelers might be down one in their secondary Bryce McCain went out that last play kind of pulled up on his right hamstring they took him to the sideline medical staff stretching him out had him run along the sideline he's currently sitting down with a heating pad he is listed as questionable so the man next up as they say would be antoine blake number 41 he's come in on his second down and six please get away clothes incomplete wreck ezel the initial pressure at help from Cameron Hayward great job here by the Pittsburgh Steelers running the t's done which is attacking in whip technique coming inside break ezel being able to apply pressure to Drew Brees to force him to try to get the ball out with ended up if he was throw a little high and throwing late could end up being a turnover note that Drew Brees he's old hopeful one right now a third down that has his lowest TV rating this year so he's really got to pick that up sent to his and run interceptions come on third down Kenny Stills down the middle of field took a hit once more by the former Ohio State Buckeye Cameron Heyward again great job and pressure up the middle to make the pocket warm for any quarterback to force them to get the ball out his hands quickly and he had a guy wide open that's one that I think they'll go off on the sidelines and probably come up with that same type of play with a different formation to attack him down field kicking it away from Antonia Brown they'd only want to take a chance and he's out of bounds after the 28 yard line freeze feeling the heat look inside that AFC North for the Steelers the final five will be against Cincinnati they go to the Queen City next weekend and in the final game of the season will be the Bengals here in Pittsburgh Robinson you know this is something that's been bothering this New Orleans Saints football team those opportunities right there you give them what they need in order to win these football games but this has to be a block by by the tight in here if you take a look you know I don't know what the tight end was thinking at that particular time but he's got to come out and block the corner and give Antonio Brown an opportunity to look up field and make a guy miss this is something that they have to get cleaned up quickly because it can become a problem late in the game though Saints have not had an interception in the opposition's last 102 it'll bring up three down again for the Steelers Roethlisberger off to a very slow start today his last two home games you may remember through 12 touchdowns in two games yes and you talk about a quarterback being on fire I tell you you know this young man throwing for Oh 40 yards but you know just going back and forth it just seemed like a PlayStation game the numbers hand was foot nice but I'd say they need to get back on track and that's being more balanced and being more effective here on third down down and Tonio brown Roethlisberger is hurt you know if you take a look at VIN Roxburgh this is a great job to sit in the pocket in than just throwing with the pressure in your face you know Bennett's been this league long enough he understands just gifted receivers an opportunity to make a big play and things will happen look like his hand or his wrist make contact without a helmet and a shoulder pad of Curtis Lofton in on the Blitz keep an eye on I'll see if they decide to run the football have been a chance to get back for lay beyond oh you take a look here Ben knowing he's getting pressured hitting his hand on the wrist of Curtis Lofton you know and getting the ball in the great position that Antonio Brown can catch it here he's handing the ball off something that we seen a little bit in warmups we've been doing hand the ball off for this opposite hand and if we keep an eye if you've seen him he asked for another run play so this may be another one how are you here going to the running back please 181 nowhere to go third down and five of the home we check in once more back in Los Angeles a game break foot person in a field well here's something you literally don't see every day a block punt by Adam Freeman of the Vikings he scoops it up picks it in 30 yards for the score that the first time Minnesota has had a blocked punt for a touchdown since 1986 your quote nothing over Carolina Tom Donovan and Chris my Kurt thank you third down and five for the Steelers well this burger is not thrown a pass possum since that right hand a contract with Curtis Lofton he's not gonna pass it here great great job by Ty Haley dialing up another run versus this Donald Z fence which open up hold by the offensive line establishing the line of scrimmage pulling there to block out Cameron Jordan doing a great job of giving us running back two opportunities to either go outside the inside fillet be on bail again who talked about him one of the best running backs in the AFC and he's proving it today over a thousand yards on the season for a lady on bail there's just his second year after the second round of Michigan State they still have not thrown since been in his hand on Lofton you know again as a quarterback in this is more than able to follow through with your throws right there Curtis Lofton did a great job hit his hand up and just take a look here handing the ball off with his opposite hand being his left hand and then asked for another run play but one thing that I begin to question now with Rob Ryan you know that the quarterbacks hurt and they're running the football you know why not glitz why not blitz to force them to throw the football to work out in your favor they're just sit back in his own what's up a yard it'll bring up another 40 down well Bell came up with a second most rushing yards in a league to DeMarco Murray at night and 151 yard and now up over a thousand look at that averaging nearly 5 per carry you know and that debt right there really gives your offense balance when you're able to run the football know so many people look at the yards but it's more about the attempts if you able to get about 30 to 35 maybe 40 runs the game now you're not asking a quarterback to throw the ball 40 times they roll him out here that's made by the longtime Saint Lance more what a career he had in New Orleans they signed him as an undrafted free agent and he put together some outstanding seasons that's his first catch today Gregg Kowski making sure he doesn't need to maybe give that helmet start of the second quarter Steelers on the move this will be the tempt way of this Drive which began at their own twenty seven white 80 inside the 15 close to the 13 yard line we saw that practice road that Roethlisberger had with Greg Kowski his backup team in between plays before that completion two more and he still doesn't look all that comfortable you know it's gonna take some time he's got he's got a warm that rest up you know this is all new technique that all quarterbacks have to go through when he gets jabs it feels like you get spill a little numbness down your wrist so for been expect to pass here I expect them to kind of get back in rhythm with the passing game because now watch out for this allout blitz snatched away from the defendant for a touchdown by Antonio Brad and looked like another possible interception for Robinson you know again Patrick Robinson you have to take advantage of the opportunities that right there was the ball was thrown directly to you you have to come down with the ball and give them an opportunity for your office to get down and drive this is something that's been a problem for the New Orleans Saints all throughout the season not taking advantage of all those opportunities that's the way this drive to cannulate remember on the very first play it should have been a pick six for Patrick Robinson still is perfect on this Drive off by Corey white look into martavis Bryant the 6'5 target in the end zone you know what's one thing you want to do as a quarterback when you have a tall wide receivers you want to give him an opportunity but he has to come down with that ball that ball hit him directly in the hands if he's able to come down with that and get his feet in from inside of the pylon that ends up being a touch them when you talk about missed opportunities in their respective divisions so many little plays over the course of the game can make the difference in that one win and you're in that one season bangs at three to make it a six nothing don't taking a look at spend walk this burger over there on the Pittsburgh sideline wanted to find out exactly where they should be looking Hillary they looked all around the wrist I mean poor poor Ben Roethlisberger I think this is one now it's warmed up he's looking to get back in rhythm you know those who passes showed that I see he has his fire back on the ball you know for a quarterback that spins it and you can definitely tell when either his father boys back at 100% and we see that tight spiral back that we used to see the fish Saints will get it out to 20 well this coming weekend for the nation's top teams a mustwin game to keep their championship hopes alive the pac12 title game on Friday night the Big Ten championship game on Saturday only on Fox and streaming live on Fox Sports go congratulations to our colleague mr. rhetorically that is series he retired yesterday at his alma mater UCLA is gone but a great moment for the Ekman plane congratulations angrily good carry on first down close to six that's something that you know Sean Payton talked about it how impressed he was with with Mark Ingram coming in these over the past couple years he's been injured he's healthy this year he suffered some injury early in the year but he's bounced back and he's been doing a great job of carrying the footballs there six six yards on that carry now you get a second of medium get you a better position throw a quick maybe a quick slant will get quick hits here not attached for Graham in the early going was a needle and that is good enough for a first down up to the 31 yard line catch by Horace again so take a look here Jimmy Graham obviously is the guy you got to focus in on you're gonna find your best let's cover live back to the fella maybe even your best corner talking to Ike Taylor that was one to be evaporated yesterday of the feed that guy that may follow to the driver playaction beautifully defended in the secondary had a linebacker John Spence who starts in place with a rookie Ryan shazier let's check in with Joe Platt back in LA all right Tom we go to Tampa Bay Doug Martin from seven yards out he takes it in and Tampa Bay's up ten nothing on the Box remember Cincinnati half game lead over the rest of the AFC North Tampa trying to keep pace with New Orleans it's a third straight road game for defenders it's hard to make the three straight away the hands went down ten nothing early on and this is England broke a tackle in the backfield dragged down right at the line of scrimmage it will bring up third down and ten for the Saints you know again when you look at this Pittsburgh Steelers defense it's about pressure pressure pressure pressure Dick LeBeau is known for that over them over the last decade them and more and so when you look at the old ban coming back Brett Keisel there you know getting to the legs of arcade I'd say all these guys are now starting to flow to show these young guys we need to get back to physical football nowhere near the first down work on the fence five Pierre Thomas now that's a very odd route or a place to go nowhere near well you know when you keep the eyes up as a quarterback and drew brees all this guys will cover they did a great job for the second day you just have to take what the defense gives you you know it's nothing wrong with money because now you get on the opposite side of 50 and push them back and give them a long field to drive and so I think Sean Payton and Drew Brees will talk about that on the sideline but that was a great job by through 42 total yards us for not only two first downs to the Saints Jean and a deadly turn up to the 25 mic Tomlin's defense is giving up a pile of points so far this year but working on a shutout here at home against the saints the plan was not for the Steelers to bring back a lot of the aging veterans on that defense they brought in diesel nearly in a plane each and every side transparency first text by the tight end Keith Miller having another outstanding season and that's a short gain of two on first down talk about bringing the band back how about the old guys that are still here Heath Miller ten years since he was drafted from Virginia you know six five to 56 he suffered some injury early in his career but he's been a guy that has made his mark here with the Pittsburgh Steelers Steelers all child leader at the tight end position and reception for CER touchdowns sir this waits for that bloom in a daylight and slithers through up to the 32 it'll bring up three down he reminds me so much of a Edgerton James and and that was something that enter James and Marshall Faulk were known for just the patience of giving his allowing his offensive lineman to get on their blocks cover up and now open up a whole form you know this young man is definitely mature than this office and everyone is impressed I'm surprised he said something nice about Marshall flaw he had you out for the league MVP one year well you know hey sometimes to go to the best man just a little high off the fingertips of Dell he is not only a weapon running the ball but out of the backfield is 57 receptions you know we had a matchup oneonone versus the linebacker David Hawthorne there just bring it down a little bit give him an opportunity to catch to turn upfield he might have made a mess and it could have been a bigtime play for the Saints defense today in only the 15th all year long for them bling puts a love kid on it Saunders let it bounce and run far away from it at the 2947 heisel been grown at beers for about four and a half years now that's a good look the power of the booze Saints defense has done a nice job again and giving up 135 yards in a a six points when the offense has done virtually nothing and that continues on a first town carry another thing is something we said about this Pittsburgh Steelers defensive line they're establishing the line of scrimmage they're pushing the offensive line from from the New Orleans Saints back to yards and which leaves that running game to really begin to falter now the hurryup offense has given the Steelers some trouble over the last couple of years Cleveland gave him Pitts earlier this season what a hurryup mode my skills and that's very close to a first count it looks like he got there 232 you know one thing you'll see here is when you get to a hurryup office you have to show your hand as a defense because you're afraid of the quick snap they go right into the zone defense with all coverage on the outside he does a great job of taking advantage of the off coverage of the slide Kenny Stills doing a good job collecting the ball and getting the first down so keep an eye on New Orleans doing that again throughout this game well he brought in an entirely new personnel package on first down so they huddled up playaction please in trouble this close it away with max protection there we had a Mike Taylor on top of Jimmy Graham Marcus Colston taking the top off of coverage great job in the coverage from the Pittsburgh Steelers which led to Drew Brees throwing the ball out around and once more for in four out and they huddle up second down and 10 first up Citadel by Marcus Colston what a career Colston his had he was a 250 second player selected in the 2006 draft and he is the Saints alltime leader and virtually every receiving category you know for a guy that's about six for continued to be a stable for them in this office they bring in Jimmy Graham they bring in a lot of these small and wide receivers to work the inside they moved him not only from the outside but they bring them inside as well so they're over three right now down slide out by Pierre Thomas once a defender and picks up the first down into Steeler territory at the 47 yard line Thomas another guy who's been there and been so reliable so effective is a runner and as a receiver you know back on the backside we talked about Ike Taylor we talked about you know you know a lot of their linebackers timid being the guys has got a coverage in there and they'll probably doubleteam him if he's inside but going the opposite way gave an opportunity for them to get those big yard out of bounds at the 27 yard line and a penalty flag comes Emily where's time to Saints adventured in to steal a territory Michell has been a solid pick up signing as a free agent from Carolina but from time to time he won't make some mental mistakes and get penalized for him we'll see if this one's on him there's no foul on the play or made it out of bounds jumper players per side we'll take a look here they're going to the weak side of this defense and the weak side of the formation which gives Mark Ingram an opportunity to get inside versus with his fullback leading the way but this guy's been doing a great job for them all season of being able to pick up those jars interesting for angrily 12 yards to the standard 15 yard line and now the Saints are banging on the door with a chance to take the lead again we talked about this with Drew Brees getting in the red area they have to score touchdown too many times they've given up with just field goals and when you plan a team like Pittsburgh who we've seen at home be able to find ways to get in the endzone the score a bunch of points you want to be able to go back and forth Griffin so take a look at I mean Jimmy Graham hasn't been in this passing game yet this is the time you want to be able to utilize his size magnetars wide opening in jail and it is a touchdown of Benjamin Watson to back up 2 grand an era point after away from a onepoint lead so three straight running plays for 45 yards and then this you know when you go on with the two tight end set here he really had both of them but you know when you have a safety that kind of withdrawal to Jimmy Graham that will leave Ben Watson wide open on the outside great job of catching the ball and getting this feet in to secure that touchdown raise his 23rd touchdown of the season 32 games in a row of course he holds the NFL record 54 straight point after good so don't look now but after dominating the Saints through the opening quarter New Orleans puts together a drive primarily on the ground and a cap it off put a touchdown pass to Watson when you talk about a young man you can look up to along the field and off the field it would be Benjamin Watson's and all those years in Cleveland you didn't hear a lot about it but the more you read about him not only what he does on the field but off the field he has just been a guy that's easy to root for yeah you know being in New England Cleveland and then coming here it was one in which I think he was brought in as a mentor to a guy like Jimmy Graham and the rest of these tight ends you know he shows them how to prepare how to be a professional how to prepare yourself each and every week out there on the football field and a way to reward him how about that of just going and getting it to the endzone so that's what amazing exciting to see them getting a touchdown catch the wind is really picked up down on the field all the kickoff bringing out from the two yard line they return fire still on his feet across the 40 the bounds of the 40 yardline 41yard returned there by marca sweet and doing a great job of setting up his blocks now finding the hole and just exploding through the hole you wish that they could have put a put a body on number 91 which would probably ended up being more of a touchdown or possibly more of a big yard game but 41 yards there now get this off as a great bill for this they just put leading back there two weeks ago they've been looking for somebody to give him a little more spark and a return get kick retired game the line of scrimmage that'll be like a tattoo well mr. McNabb it is nice to get you out of that studio you know get you out here and start calling some ballgames and you know so far a lot of things you wondered about we talked about at the very beginning could the Saints do a little more on third down they've been pretty good on defense today so far they have and the consistency was something that I talked about in the beginning and what I'm seeing right now they're applying pressure to Ben Roethlisberger him he's ineffective five or 14 passing the ball and if they can't seem to get pressure up the middle to force Ben to get off your spot they got a better chance down great playaction fake here we see the run doesen't practice and being able to run a pop pass here to Heath Miller their long lasting tight ends been arrow in a decade and he's continued to make big plays after the big place just like that throughout his career while among all active tight ends only Antonio Gates and Jason Witten have more receptions and more receiving yards who needs Millard high up for touching sceptic by the Carra whereas target of darius hayward day into double coverage and after missing a couple of chances for interceptions the Saints getting one here you know had been just trying to you know try to be aggressive it and forced the ball to hey Darius Haywood made bad decision on his part throwing it right there from Kenny Vaccaro to come up with the taro on it's a good thing for the New Orleans Saints as we talked about how they missed out on those opportunities Kenny bringing being able to bring the ball down and secure the interception and a bad thing for the Pittsburgh Steelers that's a throg killer right there for a quarterback it's it's good to be aggressive but you got to be smart with the ball well for Roethlisberger here at home his first interception and almost 200 attempts on the flip side for the Saints that is their first interception and their opponents last 112 passes that's what got him going there last Drive which led to the goahead touchdown and that together four on first down Ingram we're seeing something different here from the New Orleans Saints I mean they're being aggressive in the run game you know they've been effective passing team that can continue to spread the ball around and dissect you and in many ways what Sean Payton understands in order for us to do a lot of play action to get the ball downfield to 15 to 20 yard games we've got to run the football and they're going a great job they're good walking second five and the Steelers read that slain beautifully again Heyward was there Polamalu was there that didn't fool anybody third down right now they're they're wonderful wonderful for and you know this is the one that you want to continue to get the drive just creating a turnover from Pittsburgh the Momentum's on your side so just take a look here this might be the time Jimmy Graham has no catches right now take a look here they may go to the his side and utilize the size well they have will locked up that and that's where Glee's was looking Hiep delivered by Polamalu and he is a one down as toon springs back to his feet for Polamalu this is his first game back in the last three weeks he's been out with a wounded knee you know again we talked about this at the time to utilize Jimmy Graham he kept his eyes here for Jimmy Graham great job on the coverage there on horn Allen you know but able to go in through his progressive in and allowing food to make that big play form to move the change Polamalu a history of concussions in fact in his wife was quoted in the local papers just this morning as saying she wishes he would bang him up maybe a gain of a yard you know Donovan you look going on your career yes what was your history you know would look back on it now on concussions never suffered a concussion through our part of Italy India career yes'm you know fortunately for me I've had ankles after me the sports hernia but no concussion so thank God for that I mean you know you see some of these guys go down week after week with concussions you know you have to think about how long giggles maybe yard so third down and long coming up for New Orleans lined our way down to two and a half to go in the first half and Polamalu it looks like we'll stay on the sidelines for this third down Will Allen in his 11th year has started the last couple of weeks in place of Paulo Paulo and Allen is having a really good year he's having a really good year and something that he said you know when we got you know everyone operates opportunity kind of elevates and they took full advantage of it you know the list all the corners at the deepest attacker and now we got get back helping their there looking down the field and the catch is made by kenny steals at the 20yard line he beat the veteran william game and that'll take us to the twominute warning they hit their first big one of the day 44 yards follow your favorite team all season longest go to iTunes comm slash NFL with Donovan McNabb and charissa Thompson Thom Brenneman are you tired Fox true and Pittsburgh Steelers a pair of field goals early dominated the first quarter but ever since then it's been all about the Saints put together a touchdown drive the last time they had it after just two first downs through the first quarter and a half and they've been doing it by running a football ten rushes for 65 yards so far for Mark Ingram being effective in this offense which leads to playaction passes like we see with Kenny still going downfield great job by Sean Payton so far just dialing up the run and really forcing this defense to try to create a big place first and goal in Simon live for England you know this is not your Steelers your father's Steelers if you will this is a Pittsburgh scoring team averaging 26 again second highest in team history but they are giving up 24 points per game which is the most since 1988 you know while I played Pittsburgh Steelers were all about d\u00e9fis Dick LeBeau just pressure pressure pressure and he had the defensive line to be able to do that if he decided to sit back in his own don't know if we can say that right now the way good Saints are running the football touchdown this season second touchdown throw by Brees all set up by the interception in the end zone bilakoro you know here we're just running a playaction pass being able to get the fool back out on the flag get the the tight end on a corner route great job of just going north and south to secure for the touchdown war egg has played a little bit of everything he's played defensive end going back to college they mended the tight end they've played him in a lot of fullback situation this year back up third tied into times is good and his crowd is stunned Steelers has a ball they were on the move the interception by baccaro they hit the big pass to still setting up the touchdown thirtysix seconds remain until halftime and after a very very sluggish start it has not taken breeze in the Saints long to crank it up in a 146 lead you know you look at the New Orleans Saints and that was a big question on defense if they will be even created you turnovers and get off on third down they've been very effective thus far in this first half versus Pittsburgh feeling struggling often but it's something to be said about how they're playing on often sustaining drives it'll struggle early on they will once before on third down you know was the big play to the running back to give them an opportunity to pick up that first and from then on it's been nothing but positive yard for waiting there the big retire to set up the last ride no chance for a return here alright how about it Curt Menefee coming up at halftime coming up on the VESA halftime Andy Dalton and the Bengals try to hold on to the top spot in the AFC North the Chargers and ravens in a battle for 12th position in Baltimore and the Raiders play the lambs and while those are five teams it is Howie's favorite game today I like some more in half well of course it is Howie's favorite game of the day is beloved Raiders but now he has one of his two sons playing of course for the ramp yeah that's the it's kind of I would say fortunate for the family but you know he's going both sides now can I say two fathers two sons in the NFL Balthus burger fires and that is a first down up to the 43 yard line Steelers have all three timeouts and they will take one here in our hotel we saw a lot of familiar faces walking around the reunion of the 1974 Pittsburgh Steelers they had some of their alltime greats here John Stallworth Mean Joe Greene is number retired already this year well blood the only two of them of the big big big legendary names we're not here Terry of course has ever come back in Los Angeles and Jack Lambert not here they had nine Hall of Famers on that team winning Super Bowl nine trivia question here in a minute about that Super Bowl workout by Keenan Lewis the former Steeler on Marcus Wheaton again for a quarterback you drive back five steps give you a receiver and opportunity to compete for football but you gotta put in a position where the receiver can come and go up and go get it there you threw a little bit too far inside Keenan Keenan Lewis doing a great job of getting his eyes back so that the pass interference won't be called but 24 seconds remain until halftime at play clock down to five very close to field goal range but still plenty of time with two timeouts left no again this is the big question for the New Orleans Saints if you're gonna play that far off then you're allowing the receiver to get easy catches to get upfield great job I've been robbed this burger look for them to do something like that again toward the sideline so the receiver can catch and get out of bounds stop the party and possibly take a shot in the end zone eighteen seconds remain nope another inside of the 22 Roethlisberger there and he's thrown a number of passes just a little bit high today you know if you just take a look at Benton his footwork their release was high but most importantly his base you know his base was was off and it was led to a high pass but there he had a shot to take you know get Antonia Brown for the post so expect him to do something here to get Antonio Brown the ball in his hands to try to electrify the crowd earlier they have the twotime masked f2 the incompletion stopping the clock at 14 seconds to come home they're on a drop it in between Robinson and white to Antonio Brown it's incomplete slow down you know Ben Roethlisberger predetermined he was going to go to Antonio Brown he's got to be careful you know with the corner as well as the safety not being there you don't want to lead your receiver into a headache and there could have been a back of it Walter's Berger the interception they had the first couple of drives where they had to settle for field goal yep he's missed some open targets your product and in others roles accepted off the deflection by lofting sometimes as a quarterback when you're not impressing me begin to force a lot of balls you know you start aiming in which you start aiming ball start getting high ball start going low we've all been in that position Finn's just got to kind of refocus again to get yourself back on track come back in the second half give a whole different performance and this team will be back on track well they're going for it on fourth down rather than attempting what would be a 54yard field goal try squeezing his hip from 53 is two weeks ago and now the Saints one time now well after the Saints took a timeout Mike Tomlin has changed his mind he's going to send out his field goal kickers Sean squeezes the holder is Brad wing snapper is Greg Warren and they will try 54 yard field goal attempt 53 yards for squeezin in that loss to the Jets this season long and it that's the way the first half will end low snap and just not enough on it Saints on the road losses of three in a row in front fourteen six we go to Los Angeles internet a fee you it's leave today's excitement was given",

Seahawks Seahawks fans your Super Bowl better earsplitting though welcome to the season now Michaels Cris Collinsworth Michelle componet welcome to Seattle we all know how hard is to repeat no team has done the NFL in a decade since no 304 matrix but these Seahawks they're young they have a tremendous amount of talent and they play in this crazy Soundgarden but they won 17 of their last 18 games but keep an eye to on the Green Bay Packers Aaron Rodgers missed amp of last season with a broken collarbone they still made the playoffs Aaron's healthy in the prime of his career they have a stud running back in that he lacing and that that defense can pick it up in Green Bay they could wind up on Super Bowl Sunday in Arizona a lot to look forward to tonight six years now with Chris Collinsworth why not us because that's better than Y let's look at these Seahawks we know they I think they're better than they were last year now defensively I don't think they'd be better than what they did in that historic season last year but obviously no question Russell Wilson for better start the season and percy harvin is a very dynamic playmaker look at a full season out of him hopefully where do you see him tonight a lot to like with the Green Bay Packers what's your take well they're big threeyear tremendous on the offensive side Aaron Rodgers one of the best quarterbacks in the game Eddy lacing the offensive working of the Year last year big man with great moves and Jordy Nelson such a dynamic playmaker down the field and tonight they take on the legion of boom how do you get better than this a lot of stories in action and a lot of fun coming up over the next five Bunch and away we go tonight from Seattle Green Bay and the Seahawks and now to honor America with our national anthem Republic Records recording artist Ariana Grande Oh myself to plan time to take those earplugs out it's all yours Michelle the Packers visited Seattle the game ended with that fail marry that controversial touchdown pole which gave the Seahawks the win but often gets forgotten is the Rogers was sacked eight times in that game all in the first now Rogers told me those sacks were a product of trying to throw a lot of passes early and of course the noise Mike McCarthy said I didn't give this place enough credit we tried to spread them out it's not a half now Rogers believes they have a much better plan tonight they're going to try to run as fast as possible and he wants to go require a lot of adjustment of the line of scrimmage but still they're raising the number one defense in the NFL and their starting center is a rookie Cornelius who didn't take any snaps with the starters in the preseason and then there's the 12th man the tradition here the three honorary flag raisers Steve Largent Cortez Kennedy the Hall of Fame and they are the three Seattle Seahawks whose numbers have been retired as a franchise in its 39th just recently in and Pam this stadium as almost everybody knows in the national football about 67,000 looking on and they couldn't wait for this day to come it was a beautiful day in Seattle temperature right now is 71 degrees Mike McCarthy has been the they coach since section is length season the Super Bowl in Dallas following the 2010 campaign and Pete Carroll in his fifth year here on two national championships at USC previously coached the Jets in 94 the Patriots in the late and took them to the title at the Meadowlands nice for the kickoff Seattle won the toss and they and Warren Harris sets up in the end zone to run back the open a deco and before we can start the season twice now the ball has blown off the tee it's a little breezy in here but not normally enough to blow it off the tee and house we will put it down again to get something to come over and perfect early ready to get that often we can't wait to see it 14 season begins the typical six yards into the endzone and get ferry at the 13 yard line let's take a look right now at the they started Aaron Rodgers Butte Community College Eddie Lacy Alabama Jordy Nelson Kansas State Randall Cobb Kentucky Jerry Boykin Virginia Richard Rogers Cal Berkeley David Bakhtiari Sarah high school Josh Sidon Central Florida Corey Lindsley vo State TJ Lang Birmingham brother rights Bryan Belaga Iowa lookey centered makes his NFL debut by snapping it the Packers indicating they're going to run a warpspeed offense we'll see they start with lacy on the ground he takes the ball out to the 19 yard line Kevin Williams the long time for Minnesota biking makes the stop and now a little sugar huddle a couple of yards see an already for anything obvious was come on on second floor we have a flag and this is lacy chugging his way for a gain of a couple John Kerry is the referee one of the best Michael Bennett I think came across the line for Seattle the question was was my defense Aaron Rodgers palm or Road doesn't matter with him on the road in his career approval one touchdown to interception ratio and an NFL record one passer rating Sochi animal with a penalty of all crazy things Seattle last year great offensively offensively superbowl chance that led the league in penalties and here goes lacy a healthy dose of him breaking tackles and the second year back out of Alabama takes the ball in the 39 yard line where Bobby Wagner stops him and for a gain of 15 they go back to a guy like Jerome Bettis since we've seen a guy with this kind at his side thus far for them mm of experience last year they had to go to the ground game because Rocky's missed almost eight full game and they toss it this time the Starks they have three running backs they've got Lacey they've got storms and they've got the Juan Harris short game here second and eight McCarthy calls the plays in you say why are they going so fast they're trying to trap the big guys from the shotgun set up the screen but the pass is behind Jordy Nelson and so that's covered well and it's a los KJ right the outside linebacker taking down Lawson it'll be third down and ten Linsley who was drafted in the fifth round played his college look eight and gets the start tonight national television in the opener snapping into Aaron Rodgers against the best defense in the league parking that much third and ten it's taken down at the 40 yard line well Brian Schofield makes a stop that time they decided Aaron Rodgers so they were just going to rush three and then leave a linebacker right in the middle of the field right there so that in case he did decide to run for it they've got somebody in play ten match day to kick Earl Thomas is going to run back punch this year's a very short kick and Thomas fields it on the run and gets tackled immediately at the 35 yard line by Shawn Richardson so we looked at the Seattle office we back on opening night with NFL mobile that was the scene in the middle lanes in February confetti coming down Roger Goodell is here tonight the NFL Commissioner taking in the action I'm sure he'll be someplace else on Sunday and maybe even on Monday when the rest of the guys get underway they start with a short pass to Percy Harvin who takes it up through the 39 yard line let's take a look at the Seattle offense Russell Wilson from a whole pack of badgers Marshawn Lynch Oakland I City California first day of University fluid Doug Baldwin Stanford Jermaine Kearse Washington Zach Miller Arizona State Russell Kuhn Oklahoma State James Carpenter Alabama max Unger Oregon JR Sweezy NC State Justin Britt LH s mi z a lot of eyes tonight on the rookie over the right side beast mode Marshawn Lynch for the 43yard line maybe third and one so Wilson a thirdround pick two years ago twenty four and eight as a starting quarterback regular season of course last year took them all the way to the title with three postseason wins started his comments career at North Carolina State still had eligibility there but they weren't interested in having him come back through his senior year so on he went to Wisconsin led unto the Rose Bowl and of course the Hawks to the Super Bowl last year Marvin takes the quick flip and picks up the first down at the 48 yard line Micah Hyde makes the tackle Percy Harvin with two touches already he had two rushes in the Superbowl and ended up the leading rusher in that game that anytime you get this dynamic playmaker in the open field you do running back Dom Capers was telling me when he was with the Minnesota Vikings that they feared him as much in the backfield as they did Adrian Peterson that's the kind of talent he has he ran back that second half kickoff to make the score 29th or nothing in the Super Bowl and that was the kills drive Nash over the middle caught by Jermaine Kearse who also had a good postseason gain of eight let's take a look at the Packer defense dates on Jones UCLA with Troy going on refa High School tornadoes Mike Daniels hanno Regional High School Clay Matthews USC a Jayhawk the Ohio State University Brad Jones University of Colorado Julia's purpose North Carolina trauma wouldn't Lottie more than Bernie Georgia team Micah hide the University of Iowa Sam sill the youth and if you didn't pay much attention in the offseason this that is Julius Peppers the former Carolina Panther and Chicago Bears his turban he's gets taken down they put turban in the backfield thinking Lynch out here and he gets taken down by Matthews from though game you better get somebody on this guy you leave him on block he's gonna run down your running back from behind the plate Clay Matthews had real problems with his thumb had surgery in the offseason and if you can imagine for a pass rushing defender kind of grab and pull with that that really limits you right off the bat we see something explosiveness back so her his first play of the season taking turbine down from the nine Lynch comes back in now Wilson from the gun on third the two in the passes deflected in the air and then intercepted and then it's loose again are they got a corner an interception no it's been a quota an incompletion Jones came down with the ball but they're going to say incomplete what a great play I think that was Miller who went up and knocked it out watch this it comes back this is going to be an easy interception Miller gets back on his feet and knocks that ball out tremendous play Russell Wilson says thank you very much great play by Sam shields initially but then Miller saved him an interception so Seattle's first punt off the foot of John Ryan Rayville Cobb back to run it back standing at the 8 yard line nose down with backspin and as a short kick and you got a flag down into the kicker as a flag is gone by Perry Mike Daniels came in to try the pond Ryan's dick the ticker but since it was fourth in school that finds enough for a first down right up the gut this was an easy call comes right in catches them tries to catch them on the way down but it doesn't do you any good and one thing you do not need to do with Seattle is give them extra opportunities that hurts like Daniel is a really good player out he is a talented guy when the strongest guys you'll see playing defensive end around but that was a big mistake Wilson now from a shotgun at the 40yard line as the Seattle's open and drive and they give it the carbon and Hartman gets the first down and picks up a gain of first while Faye Zack Miller block the muffins been huge on this drive first down look familiar here comes the jet sweep across the way here and before the defense you see Julius Peppers been around the league about 10 12 years he couldn't even figure out what just happened to him but first he hardly went by him so fast this isn't play they ran it twice and a Super Bowl for forty five yards and still working Marvin he came over in that crave last year but missed almost the whole season hip surgery offensive coordinator down bevel had him at Minnesota he calls the plays play clock is down to one and they just do snap it feeling the pressure watch the takeoff hips to the side wanna know game haha Clinton dicks runs him out of bounds I see Clinton about that and that a great name is you just wonder if he told a joke what would you do you know I don't know but he is a young man that he's a safety that has come over he's going to sort of mix his way in with Micah Hyde who's a little bit more of a cover kind of guy haha Clinton dicks is a is a bigger guy that maybe if Marshawn Lynch gets it going to see more of him halfway mark of the opening quarter on open a night with no score second and ten puts that head down and takes the ball through 21 yard line the means to see how much Lynch carries the ball this year he's had more than 300 carries in each of the last two seasons he's not 28 years old watch the young rookie right tackle Justin Brett on the backside get the veteran Julius Peppers on the ground and if you can do that with the way that Marshawn Lynch can hit some cutbacks end up with some big runs a lot of pressure on Justin Britt very good run blocker we'll see how he holds up against these excellent pass rushers second round pick that no time on Missouri high school heavyweight wrestling champion third down and five from the 21 yard line what's coming listen get to the way the pass is caught but not enough to the first down as Doug Baldwin had to come back to make the catch and forward progress won't met him the first Ramon Williams is there for the stop doing a lot of things already with clay math he was going to stunt inside here and almost get there but Russell Wilson's doing such a great job of getting the ball out of his hands and there's the young rookie on the outside against Julius Peppers pretty good down that way so fourth and one is born win' had to come back to make the catch and Williams to make sure he didn't picked up the first this will be a 35yard field goal attempt for Steven Houska and what do we have here we've got a timeout they almost got with too many men on the field if they had been caught there they've been able to get that snap off it would have been first down again 30 second time almost two huge penalties or mistakes on special teams to start this game Carroll contending that they didn't get the timeout called Josh Boyd was one of the guys with about 13 guys on the field right now and so they figure it out and start to run off but Seattle obviously they may have tried to get this snap off and if they had it would have been a first down Nick Perry was the other guy to account for the 13 so haschke now will reset at the 25yard line trying to put up the first points of this season John Ryan who's the punter will do the holding Julius Peppers inside there tick blockers ever for many years and this kick is perfect soon as your first score of the season 603 left in the first Seattle three in Green Bay nothing they don't miss a moment of Sunday Night Football this season with NBC Sports live extra take the game with you anywhere online and tablet great shot of Seattle and the ferris wheel it's open a couple years ago Elliott Bay look at downtown Seattle home I'll say it always is but of course when you come home as the Super Bowl champion extra special obviously you see the house cool and in the end zone by Harris the family aside of course is the Space Needle here in Seattle found out about a week ago he was going to be the starter in this man well Goldman zone power here coming off the doubleteam biting lated Ohio State he played in the big house what a way to make you Dave nice opening salvo for Linsley a kid from Youngstown Ohio and he snaps it to roger's on first down and the pants to the outside has taken there by Nelson Lindsley grow up near Cleveland but he wasn't a Browns fan he said I was a Packer fan in fact he was such a Packer fan when he was seven years old for Halloween he dressed up as Brett Favre I asked him last night bezerra knowing this he said no I said he will not seem overwhelmed from the 31 Raju is throwing and it's lacy trying to break a and he gets a lot of help and he gets gang technical let's take a look at the Seattle defense Michael Bennett 80 Taylor high school tournament game Tennessee Brennan me bein Krish is go Cliff Avril Boilermaker Malcolm Smith USC Bobby Wagner D Utah State KJ right Mississippi State Richard Sherman stamp cam Chester Virginia Tech Boro Thomas vbu Texas designer Maxwell CC Blaine look at those numbers they're right up there with the 1985 Chicago Bears he was points most takeaways phenomena on every level Blakelock to zero as rogers gets it away the traffic and it's incomplete rainbow table covered on the play by German Lane simple little pick play Bob coming up the sideline he hesitated just a minute with this entire game so far Jordy Nelson Richard Sherman third and 14 sliding left rogers buys a ton of time and then that pace is underthrown often tended for Nelson fourth and 14 and they get a little skirmish going on back at the 15yard line becomes a roll off the corner here and teach ain't laying coming from the backside the guard just took April out that has become very much in vogue in the national and here's Earl Thomas going to do something new this year where's Patman Tara was three yards hold and take no longer Detroit for one back the air for the second time in the game miss pants underneath it and then loses the football as he did not call for the fair catch the Packers assured they have it and will wait for the call here from the crew they have it so Thomas running back kicks and house was right there all over and I'm surprised Thomas didn't call for the fair Kasia too costly yeah the Richard Sherman blocked house right into the kick returner Earl Thomas and Earl Thomas now that's two times in a row he took a huge chance just trying to field the punt you know the kind of pride he has he is a guy that wants to be the tough guy out there but that's twice now he took huge chances not calling a fair catch in this time in Boston aha Clinton Dick's wound up with the recovery and that gives Green Bay excellent position at the 34 yard Seattle up three nothing Lacey and in the back view of cleaning the floor back and Lacey follows and then goes to the outside but he can't turn the corner that's the Andal with officious march\u00e9 and working out of new CLA in on the tackle okay one thing you're going to learn about the National Football League is they're going to play you inside out they want you to truck it out one NFL defensive ends aligned unless you're Gale Sayers second and ten three backs now I think Wireless is also in the bathroom and there's nothing happening there to the 32 yard line KJ Wright makes us not Laci pick in the second round play for saving as Alabama last year Green Bay looking for the running game had a confession early in the season they also added loft week but then when Rogers got hurt they had to go to the ground games and he got a lot of experience in 2000 the first time really third in a Roger slides the rules and the pass is taken in by Cobb does he have the first down it's right there on the yellow line they're gonna spot it and it should move the changement does Aaron Rodgers just so good moving to his left it's such a tough throw drills it right in there but that ability just like Russell Wilson has that just slide out of the pocket by a little at two quarterbacks tonight we were both great outside of the pocket and that ba\u00f1os of the popliteal we're just great this is notion and he'll make it burst down and goal for Green Bay Byron Maxwell came at the end of last year and played really well but because Seattle does not flipflop their quarterbacks they're able to get their best receiver Jordy Nelson on fire and Maxwell any they want it and basically Richard Sherman's on the other side again Jarrett Boykin their number now they stack the backs here Rogers have taken it out of the shotgun fakes the hand off this is Nelson Nelson stretching for the goal line and he's out of bounds uppity backhoe by Maxwell and this game plan has not been too complex so far max flow comes up they go to that back shoulder or come back he plays off a little bit they just raise up and let Jordy Nelson try to make a play second down and goal Oh hurry up here the play clock is that two and Rogers takes the time out so he surveyed the situation Green Bay coming into the game a lot of talk about they wanted to run 75 plays per game they did that in one of their in the first half anyway on that pace in a preseason game Chris and tonight they've run 14 plays in almost a full quarter yeah and the difference is that the defensive lineman for the Seattle Seahawks last season they played about 65 percent of the snaps that's what they sort of averaged even on the top end of that so they're trying to make them stay on the field for an entire Drive and wear them down Rogers had that broken collarbone last year in midseason did comeback blading in Chicago in a last game of the year led that tremendous comeback at the finish at Soldier Field got him into the playoffs they have in San Francisco but lost in the wildcard round Defence's forget about John Coon touchdown catching the football now they have Mike Daniels in the backfield so they put the tackle in there there he is Coon and he reaches out and his into the touchdown line Jets coming in to say he was able to stretch out before forward progress was stopped and in go the Packers we just think that he's gonna hand the ball to lacy the other way let's make sure he crossed the plain here yes I don't think he was ever down as knee was never down I guess they never blew the whistle from momentum and then clearly leaned it across the line while scoring plays automatically reviewed yep he's across the line and he part of the ball over any part of the goal line that's 21 regularseason touchdowns now for that man who none of them longer than 10 yards but that's what he does comes in in short yardage and does it here so far special teams mistakes leading to both schools Mason Crosby or the extra point so what set it up it was the muck punch Thomas put it on the ground and the backers take it in for the first touchdown of the season 7 3 3 today well Mike Holmgren was here for a long time and there's a guy of course who was on both sides in this game Green Bay took them to a Super Bowl had a street named after him took Seattle to a Super Bowl in Detroit against Pittsburgh after the old five season which they lost 21 to 10 and the kickoff goes through the end zone so Seattle will get the ball 125 to go in the corner with Green Bay up 54 on opening night well that's a nice pair to draw to Julius Peppers coming over from Chicago play Matthews drafted a few years ago by Green Bay take a look at some of those numbers eight Pro balls for peppers for four Mathies would have made it a 5th appearance probably heading that had the broken thumb on two occasions last year and that deep bench is on the field right now as the ball is heaved at all Marshawn Lynch for a gain of a couple and they're going to hold against Seattle now Clay Matthews is saying it's on Justin Britt the rookie immediately snapped around offense the 68 can hear Kennedy first out is right here gonna kind of hook him around the neck shoulder area and got the call one thing that Russell Wilson's done a nice job of at least so far he's getting the ball out of his hands really quickly Dom Capers the defensive coordinator now feels like he has more healthy pass rushes that he's had in years and Russell Wilson knew it he knew he's gonna have to good fought of his hand we haven't seen any of his sort of trademark scrambles out there first out in 20 now I guess she breathed that as it takes you to the 20 gain of 11 Matthews runs him down there it'll be second down one of the real pleasant surprises so far this preseason has been to play these two guards JR Sweezy and James carpenter James carpenter on the other side the guy that maybe wasn't always in the best of shape came back and just great shape number 77 and they feel like that he is really has a chance to be a star in this game the JR Sweezy penetrate as well they can shot handoff from McKenzie's maybe aren't sila first found by percy harvin before he goes out of bounds so they've turned a first and 20 into a third down and one as the clock will tick down and probably end the quarter before they get another playoff you know sometimes as a quarterback getting out of the pocket just kind of get you in the game and somebody with the mobility of Russell Wilson I think that'll help him here early and that is the end of the first quarter Green Bay 7 Seattle 3 this kickoff special resumes from Seattle after these messages and tonight's aerial coverage being brought to you by Geico start the second quarter in Seattle Al Michaels Cris Collinsworth and Michele Tafoya on a beautiful opening night it's third down and one now for the Seahawks from their own 29 yard line he will pick up the first down running them down I'd say a Marsha she's just so good he breaks more tackles and anybody that I can name in the National Football League and you think you've got him he's not a huge guy about 215 220 pounds but one guy trying to get him it just doesn't happen Julius Peppers crashed down across the face and that was Justin Britt able to just ride him right out a hole to the outside to Percy Harvin smack before he can get to the line of scrimmage in the ball almost came loose there clean Matthews is right there to secure like Clay Matthews is playing angry out here so far looked like he tried to rip the head off of Percy Harvin on this one come out here he reads this all the way quickly gets off the block and just gets brushed Cochran by the head play Matthews say what Allen he's right and when he's healthy he has been as dynamic a defensive players we have in the game it just always a shame it seems like something kind of knocks him out of his damn house that pedigree by the way yeah wide open at the 50yard line is Harvin and on second and long Percy Harmon takes them all into Green Bay territory they spotted in about the 32 what a move off the ball by Percy Harvin he's going to come over and duck underneath the coverage here make Morgan Burnett basically get picked off his own guy and perfectly done by Russell Wilson those crossing routes are just something that are going to give the Packers nightmare here's Zach Miller the tight end on the outside boy is it nice to have a tight end that can block a superstar passion Elijah like that already five catches tonight for Harper they fake it to Lynch they think everybody Rocket makes the tax pitch into the end zone beautiful they took Finland they took a page out of words play bar the read option pull up and down the field the corner came up to get Russell Wilson and he just dumped it right in behind him Sam Shields thought that was just the read option so he was going after Russell Wilson Russell Wilson pulls it down and throws a touchdown pass great play design and Clinton dicks misses the tackle gonna stop that about the five they take the lead house go to kick the extra point the second quarter the Seahawks backtoback 33yard plays a harvin reception the locket reception and dress like that Seattle takes the lead over Greenberg 10 to 7 well that drive started with a penalty on Britt they started at the 20 the Britt penalty took them back to the 10 and away they went it's an 80yard Drive two runs four passes the backtoback 33 yarders the Marvin and walk it and Seattle has the lead for the first time ten to seven Seahawks on top nature's to get back out onto the field he has begun the night six out of eight for 34 yards Paris hesitated and then comes out and gets the ball to the 16 yard line as we go back to the touchdown Sam shields hadn't seen this one see the read option he comes up and there's nobody in behind but haha Clinton dicks here he comes a little changeup that's a play they use a lot in college now welcome to the NFL usually done by in my favorite part nice people kids they're kind of laughing the best you can read his lips level one of the top officials in the league might have got head coaches off had they not go got so deep into the playoffs less from the 16 and lacy get stuff and then it's so tough for an assistant coach to have a chance because that the team needs the coach they normally want to hire him Chris in January they don't want to have to wait around so you've got bevel you've got Dan Quinn the defensive coordinator the pair of guys who might be head coaches right now were not for the success of the Seahawks now both the coordinators had two interviews of piece but they could wait you know there's too much pressure to hire a coach and Rogers will dump it off the lazy he would snack at the 20yard line you off the green bay you know we talk about coaches and you think about them and you've got Lambo of course and Lombardi and we saw Mike Holmgren and this guy he doesn't get what he deserves Mike McCarthy nine years my pretty W yeah and really he's since the head coach believes the office look at their offensive numbers offthecharts they've had a couple of lead in the history of the league he is the second highest points per game average top only white third and five and a quick toss on a slant and a first down his pop makes the catch Lane rolls and down and that moves the chains but Jeremy lanes had groin injuries and you just wonder how healthy is going to be on he's changed trypsin he thought it was going to be that pic play again he reacted to the outside and they just changed it up and at the lacy passes away picked up of two or three Bobby Wagner the middle linebacker Stockton we had two Packers down on that play yeah you got Malaga and you got Richard Rodgers so you get your right tackle and your tight end so a pair of Packers are down to needing attention Saturday night one of college football's grade rivalries Notre Dame in Michigan you can warm up for it on NBCSN at 6:30 Eastern and then the game at 7:30 Eastern you had Rogers and Waga both going down on the same flavor paper look at how it happened Malaga's head right back into rich I think blog pushing like symptoms for what happened that sharad number 78 there it's our fourth year a Mississippi State starts and he gets taken down after a very short game by Bobby Wagner got a little taste of that Park tackling that they talk about this team does about as good a job of take great pride and third down and four pretty tough to run with offense at warp speed in this ballpark bleh clock at four handoff goes to starts and he takes it after the 44 yard line and so the backup back you've got Lacey of course is number one but starts can do the job found out about that was Super Bowl a few years ago and the one Harris is number three and he had a great year last year five and a half more three touchdowns over 2000 Raja's protected well and that's parlous making the catch out of Bounce he goes camp Chancellor with the tackle Aaron Rodgers he's not as good as it gets right now because we've lived in this whole Brady and Peyton Manning era and they're still great but he came along a little bit late if it was right up there with him there's no question about it seperates in a little you can phone left or right or in the pond I feel cool breeze in there as well second down and eight and it starts it's taken down gang again everybody going to the ball third down and five today you have to start going russell wilson and there's first two years in the league don't forget Angela see him on Sunday night Indianapolis against Denver thirtyfive Rogers escaping buying time beep that field into traffic and two flags I'm trying to turn around yet Wagner going all the way down filled with him and Bobby Wagner getting tangled up with him and to flex come in pretty amazing the Bobby Wagner could run that far down the field with a guy like Randall Cobb but once that ball is near its defense 154 on a minute first now so difficult for anybody to learn to turn their head and middle line aren't used to doing this when the ball is coming got it your head or just the receivers action of going back into the defender is an automatic pass interference that's a 44 yard penalty first and goal from the and the outside this comet is going to wrap up menial by Lane at that play where Jordy Nelson never turned around to look for the pass he simply was going to block coming off the line of scrimmage they're going to try and get it here and just huh under 8 to go on a half she watched by three threatening with a second and goal only see if the legs going takes the ball just inside the 5yard line third and goal correct me if I'm wrong but I think every single staff Garrison's been on rich side Nelson buying time intended for Nelson and that'll make a fourth down yeah it's a good thing that Aaron Rodgers to it where he did or Earl Thomas is gonna have an interception Rodgers saw him and was hoping Jordy Nelson would slide away from him but I don't think Jordy Nelson ever saw what Burrell Thomas was doing so they can't cash all the way in on that 44 yard penalty has settled for a field goal attempt Mason Crosby had a nice comeback year last for season in 2012 and this 23yard attempt is good that drive which ends with three instead of seven and the game tied at ten Russell Wilson can do it from outside the pocket his two years in the league 1821 yards and 17 TD passes that's the most of the NFL outside the pocket and inside the pocket ain't bad either and only two quarterbacks for the 100 plus rating inside and outside the pocket over the past two seasons and the other is a guy we're going to see on Sunday night the incredibly mobile Peyton Manning yeah yeah that was one as soon as that one came up I was like say wait a minute who is that he just is good everywhere I go home and wrote to at the goal line Percy Harvin look into some room I was able to run a factor in the 30yard line what a difference he's going to make this season player there's this guy Russell Wilson one of the things he fully worked on is quickening up his release time 0.33 is about as good as it gets we've seen a couple down around point three oh he's been pretty consistent at point three three you'll see this rolling motion pretty much straight up maybe a little loop at the bottom but he gets that ball out of there very quickly and so far these pass rushers really haven't had the chance to get to him but we also haven't seen a lot of his scrambling where a lot of his trademark plays come from very efficient only one incomplete pass to this in the pocket this time I'm going in Zach Miller the tight end great tax Zach Miller is going to be out there working against Clay Matthews and I thought this thing was overthrown all the way that catch beautiful Zach Miller doing it blocking on these guys and now receiving over the top and he get his hand under it I think he did to the line quickly and now Wilson is going to escape gets away and then throws it away in the stands Josh Boyd put the pressure on that time you know one of the things for young quarterbacks is that they just have to develop some trust in their receivers to make plays like this give them opportunities these guys are brilliant pros and I think Brussels Wilson fully understands now once Wow just give guys like Zach Miller or Percy Harvin or Jermaine Kearse some opportunities think back to Jermaine Kearse and that fourth down play in the championship game play that one didn't go season for him good Camilla too 7:10 they get the Harmon crush the pullon flag is thrown and winds up with wall we'll see about the penalty Jewish peppers is there for the tackle John Perry making the call here offside defense and that's Julius Peppers you know Julius Peppers really had never played an outside linebacker and he was getting ready to go to Carolina thinking you just go home and finish his career there and then the Green Bay Packers called and said I'd you like to be a standup 34 outside linebacker he's that I've been waiting my whole life to have a chance to do that loves it and we've got assume he's gonna get better and better at it as he goes so he flew north instead of South as Marsha it's a gain of 21 yards pull back just in the game Derrick Coleman watch this fly this out the inside linebacker gets the angle they're on Brad Jones and there goes Marshawn Lynch and if you're a defensive back that is the last thing you want to see coming down to fact look at this monster five 11 to 15 who can ever forget that day against New Orleans in the playoffs a couple years back on it one away i snap to the 11yard arvin can line up a lot of places I don't think it probably won't see him do is take a direct snap gonna get who knows well here's what happens is he comes out from the outside defensively you think you're looking at an empty set a pure pass situation all of a sudden Percy Harvin comes in the backfield they hand in the ball and he runs like a running back Marvin comes out second down and one leave the fullback in near Derrick Coleman to the outside this would have been stopped instead is able to move forward and pick up the first down broke away from Clinton dicks aha Clinton dicks is finding out the NFL's a little different in the SEC good is Alabama and there or as a safety you hope you're going to make this tackle but not many people do against Marshawn Lynch and Dom Capers knew it he said if we try and tackle this guy with one guy gonna be a long night for us under four minutes until halftime is first and goal putting it back and he goes touchdown Marshawn Lynch pickin right up for his left off the last two years seven carries 59 yards and a touchdown to give the seattle elite ago read option here but you're going to have a kickout block against Matthews he never sees it coming and can't get there on the backside and Lynch just walks in Luke Wilson throwing a nice walk stealing house go to the extra point and the Seahawks that time go 70 yards in sixth place four of them on the ground to here and as we open the 2014 season at 17 well the stars coming out okay the winter will see all of these guys at one time or another on Sunday night Barry leading us into the game gradually and have a baby so exciting Mike Fischer congratulations and we love having a superstar like Carrie Underwood kicking off our show every Sunday night she is fantastic busy household Mike Fischer ready to go to training camp of the national creditors in the National Hockey League that's taken by Micah hive in the end zone and we go to the show well right tackle Brian belaga went to the locker room after they looked at his left knee and took the brace off his left knee now keep in mind he missed the entire season last year with a torn ACL in his left he is questionable to a turn as for dynein richard rogers who me he has a stinger that's sort of a nerve irritation in his neck he also is questionable out right Thank You Michelle there is Roger Z's standing along the sidelines what University of California barking sending in the floor Rogers hang it in the pocket and then it goes to his train in barlas for a gain of 18 it was interesting hearing Aaron Rodgers talking about Andrew Corliss he said you know he's a guy who doesn't always look that great in practice and you don't think that much then you get him in the game when the chance now drafted in the fifth round 2010 out of Penn State lacy behind garnish Seattle defense is right there to meet him at the line of scrimmage led by Bobby Wagner third year they picked him in the second round in 2012 he's the second round or and Wilson's the third round boy they draft so well in Seattle John Schneider Pete Carroll we picked up some degree too in preseason but great so far second in town crowd and full throw here play clock down under Oh Rogers he started a call for time and then you got the rookie center who wants to snap it and he's getting an earful here from Rogers the Rogers calling Tyler his snack the timeout Green thirty seconds yes they're fine anytime I look like the Super Bowl yeah Michele Tafoya back in Seattle you've seen Aaron Rodgers at the line of scrimmage trying to communicate with his linemen well coach Mike McCarthy radios in the place inside Aaron Stillman with similar speakers and we've got a radio just like Mike McCarthy's let's see what it sounds like in all those toys out sounds like brunch to me it's 2010 after the timeout with Rogers just good given age to dump over the middle and stocks is able to lunge for the first down so a big first down picked up here on a second and 10 and that's going to take us to the twominute warning good along gear a twominute warning 1710 Seattle turn at a halftime coming up they had told me an ironic check it in their thoughts on the first half and then Bob and Hines will be here to take a look at Sunday night's matchup in Denver linear outside Seattle the back was done with two minutes to go and a first and ten at the 49 yard line walks up by seven and Rogers gets it away quickly fixed release farlis makes the catch beam of about six Rodgers very much under control now obvious analyst o'clock all the way down I want to give the Seahawks a chance at the hall made points on the board we need a running its 31st play it's a swing.the starts and he's going to be forced out of bounds to make it third down Bobby Wagner is there and that's gonna make it third down and three Richard Sherman says man I gotta do everything I can to keep from getting bored mr. bored the knife he's nothing zero has done as well you ever see him do that thing where he goes that's what it is because five four you can go away from these days on this side like rocket for run a snuck up front Rogers able to step away from it throwing and Rogers was he across the line he had the first real man he did I had to do is take another two steps and he had that first door now maybe not that was Bobby Wagner was coming up on him maybe that was what he was thinking but guy as elusive as Rogers is there's the line and it's not over the line up as long as that back foot is still on that line it's not a penalty but I just thought he had a chance to run so fourth down now they'll have to punt with this one matchdays kick wouldn't bounce and it takes a nice Seattle as it comes back to the 17 yard line that's Seattle player we're really close to that goal and I think that's what the Packers are saying if it just lays its foot right Jeremy Lane if it touches them it's a live ball did not course they want a flag they want to look at it see if this ball touches the foot Jeremy Lane I don't think he really knows where it is now it did not know not until the Packers player touched it anyway for sure I mean they touched it first I think he was close yeah John Coon who was the first guy there so you've got 66 seconds and Seattle has all of its timeouts you know a year ago at this time on opening day I think you probably run it a few times get out of here because Green Bay doesn't have their timeout after what we saw Russell Wilson tonight and in the Super Bowl and probably let him work this a little these bombs away if they want turban into the backfield bound by Doug Baldwin and he can't get out of bounds the clock will keep going under a minute the acara looking up at the clock they have all of their timeouts don't take one here second down and six and Wilson under pressure and runs right into Matthews a flag is down he got Matthews and peppers both there and a flag is down in the secondary at the 32 yard line oh boy this one's gonna hurt you go from a sack and into the half you can automatic first down if it is illegal contact defense number 59 inside linebacker Brad Jones and there goes the sack and Seattle has a first down little double move here by Zach Miller and you can see the grab not a difficult call at all five seconds you're gonna put three more seconds back on the clock there it is a thirty five seconds the ball is at the 26 yard line against Seattle is going to get the ball to start the second half front of Canada near the end of the first Kirby take it up to the 35 yard line an outoftown timeout right here for 27 seconds and we can tell you that this kickoff special is being brought to you by GE presenting the boy who beats by Toyota let's go places by Verizon more live games than ever before with NFL mobile and by McDonald's official sponsor the NFL in Lebanon that's gonna be on the voice this year lost that show get lucky not you I was born like quarterback's tonight not too many incompletions in this game only touch that fast but walking to the longing of the smiling mr. Wilson before this one said and done one of these two quarterbacks is going to scramble around and make a big play that may end up deciding it on a film marry second of three motion in and almost intercepted by Clinton dicks Doug Baldwin and got behind him the Clinton Dix head position incomplete third and three nice play by Clinton Dix here he is going to be right here and when Wilson moved to his right his hope was that Clinton Dix the young rookie was going to go with him he did not held his ground he's missed a couple of tackles tonight the perfect coverage they're an angry Doug Baldwin got him that was pretty funny stuff wasn't it yeah they talked about every day Doug Baldwin is angry at something 33 keep it on the ground and suck his turban and they will take a timeout 14 seconds left 14 seconds left Seattle would need a good chunk of yardage to afford house to the opportunity to attack on three more monsters careerlong 54 so they need to get it somewhere around the 35 yard line give him a realistic chance there's about 25 yards he is or something's gonna take it out of the shotgun form and walk throw that away and that's going to chew up a total of four seconds leaving ten on the clock and tell you the past rush of the packers is starting to have a little impact busting Britt the rookie on the outside and Julius Peppers kind of throws him aside as Russell Wilson starts to go and on the other side Russell o Kuhn who's coming off that toe surgery in the offseason and he's just getting back into form so we'll keep an eye on this as we go then gets into the 48 but even with the time out here that's gonna be well out of housekeys range or anybody's rainy and that'll do it for the first half so on opening night Seattle leaving we may by a score of 17 to 10 with the Hawks getting the ball when we start the second half coming up next thrown a half ton after these messages from your NBC station the Toyota halftime let's go places at halftime the seahawks lead the packers 1710 hines ward coming off the first and Patrick Tony Dungy and Rodney Harris berry Bob thank you it pains me to give you credit Rodney but in the pregame you said you didn't want Earl Thomas back there returning punts he's back there because Golden Tate is left went to Detroit so you didn't like it and he ended up with a month punt and Dan also said that he's the best free safety in the league I never said that he was the best punt returner but I saw him warm enough he didn't look comfortable back then he dropped one and also Hines Ward pointed out Richard Sherman is always on the defensive left they put Jordy Nelson on the other side worked on Maxwell thing that impressed me about Green Bay was the physical player that offensive line it hasn't always been like that though they piloted in here got the lead and they have been very very impressive now let's look at Seattle because we weren't sure how much offense or how much defense Green Bay was going to have that how much often Seattle was going to be able to put up here what have you seen so far that's a little bit different with Seattle but what they wanted to do they wanted to get Percy Harvin involved really early and that's what they did they gotten the ball in so many different ways whether it was a jet screen whether it was a handoff Dan they come out he's so versatile they line them up in so many different places and then it starts with Marsalis that physical running style getting people to play the run sets up this this is the new off the read option running play not there but now I can throw it when the defense reacts and this is what they try to do they try to come out with all these strict ways and they wear you down with marsala de maras on bit cutback Lane because they read out some pass seattle's offense is playing out state gets stronger as the game goes on okay what do you expect second half start with Green Bay Green Bay I expect them to do the same thing stay patient don't get away from the run game don't come out here and try to spread this team out and pass the ball 3040 times run the football what Seattle do well Seattle is doing a good job of keeping Aaron Rodgers in the pocket they're gonna keep feeding Lynch and keep beating Harvard guys coming up look ahead to the Colts and Broncos on Sunday Night Football but first it takes a lifetime of work and dedication to become one of the greats and this week coach T catches up with two of his finest recruits ever Seahawks 17 Packers 10 at halftime meanwhile Sunday night on NBC the Broncos host the Colts in Denver it's the second time Peyton Manning will play against his old team and his successor Andrew Luck and last year in the midst of memorable seasons for both clubs when Manning went back to Indy after an emotional scene before the game it was the Colts who took care of business Indianapolis can now say thanks for the memories anytime you're matched up against Peyton Manning it is an IO resigned in my mind that it's part of the job comingout party for a guy that doesn't need one things change and I have transitioned into this second chapter of my football career in Denver Broncos have helped me with that transition there's the record 50 first touchdown Wade Outfitters he white got it he's gonna score it's the second biggest comeback in NFL history hey Bros touchdown Demaryius Thomas Denver the champions of the American Football Conference okay Hines Ward story line here Wes Welker suspended four games for PE d use now that came just on the eve of the season practically losing Eric Decker in the offseason was one thing you have a chance to figure out what to do this is a double block oh it is no question but the huge blow has to be wellthought because Peyton Manning loses his go and in a short period of time I don't know if he can establish that rapport with anyone what can they do well Emmanuel Sanders the guy that I played with you can put him on the inside he does have experience playing in the slot it's just difficult to put a rookie in that slot position because the slot position is normally your quarterback other wild receivers all right times we'll see on Sunday night tomorrow on The Today Show live from Denver and DC in the NFL begin a seasonlong celebration of fans across America it's called together we make football Josh Elliott is already on a flight to Denver so he can be up early for today and that's actually our big moment also Sunday morning Chuck Todd they've used as the new host to meet the press and he will have an interview with President Obama here in Seattle it's the Seahawks 17 in the Packers town and the second half is next is we look toward noda halftime go places NFL kickoffs game changers brought to you by Bo's official sound of the NFL just playing angry out here makes the catch bitch into the end whose official sound of the NFL well the first half of the first of 256 games this season regular season completed a look at downtown Seattle Al Michaels with Cris Collinsworth Michelle the first half buzz with the score Seattle's 17 Green Bay 10 Earl Thomas fumbled a punt return that led to a toon touchdown run Green Bay the lead meanwhile Percy Harvin out almost all of last season after hip surgery had a big first and with five catches Aaron Rodgers averaging only 4.8 yards per fess and 86 yards as the defense has done its work for C Allen Marshawn Lynch in that she's informed with seven carries for 59 yards in a nine yard touchdown run ya know BJ Raji I think is hurting a little bit when you're trying to stop Marshawn Lynch they're great nose down here's the ticket marvin told us yesterday he's coming out it doesn't go out of the end zone and he does here but not very far good special teams work by Green Bay ball of the thirteen and we go to Michelle well Earl Thomas had that muffed punt in the first half and Pete Carroll told me at halftime he spoke to him and he trusts he'll be making the right decisions from now on as far as what he expects from Green Bay's offense here in the second half he said we just have to keep them in front of us meanwhile for the Packers Brian belonga their right tackle is done for the night with that left knee injury as far as the pace of the Packers offense we expected them to go at warp speed but Mike McCarthy told me I have no problem with the pace of our offense when I have a problem with is us not breaking tackles and us not making tackles on defense all right Thank You Michelle and that could be a very significant injury the m\u00e1laga if he is awkward and he Curry at a time tons of the pace they ran pinky to first half play links often running again take him over 70 yards as he picks up 14 on the first scrimmage play of the third quarter talk a little bit about big James Carpenter right here and what he's been able to do just so much better conditioned and that is a big man he pushed out of the way Mike Daniels they're probably as strong a defensive linemen as they have but so far the the big three of Seattle is out playing the big play for the Green Bay Packers at least offense from the 28 to the outside there he goes again that's a tenyard game his peppers finally runs them out of bounds so Lynch right now the linchpin of this office tonight bespoke 9 carries 82 yards and a touchdown these two backs are pretty similar they're powerful guys and they can run you over but they also have that great quickness in the hole I mean that is a lot of moves for a guy the size of Marshawn Lynch he gets a blow turban is now the back and here he goes up to the 41 yard line heat would be the second or third back as the season moves along they also have christened the Michael who was drafted in the second round on a Texas A&amp;M in last year that he's inactive tonight just watch the moves inside the hole that's what makes a great running back everybody always they turn on you know the combine and they want to watch a 40yard dash time and a deadly run for three who cares because all it matters for running backs is how does he do in tight spaces and can you make people miss and Marshawn Lynch I think maybe the best in it and the league as far as a big back could be a steamroller what he has to do from the 41 stepping up and once and hit as he throws they got him by the back foot and the pass is incomplete Pepper's putting the charge on second to ten Julius Peppers coming around the edge on Russell Oh Coon a very good player but again a little rusty because he's coming off of that toe surgery and Russell Wilson even against the five man rush one of the things they were worried about in Green Bay was rushing him with just four because that always leaves a gap somewhere for a Russell to step up and crew and so now they've been bringing some fiveish like a threeman rush this time though they're coming the grips to listen gets to the office contact there's an incidental why Lockette is the intended receiver McCarthy wants a flag Sam shields covering on the play no offensive interference third downs I tell you Sam Shields has what I call cocky speed he's the guy that's not afraid to get in your face he turns around and I don't think that is interference although they're supposed to be tough on the defensive backs and the receivers this year with all that I don't know that we had one holding poll on Brad Jones but this hasn't been called anywhere near like it was in the preseason preseason they were Flag crazy there goes Lynch sitting up in the slot out of the empty backfield Baldwin who turns the other that's a great tackle by saying shields this wonder if Doug Baldwin had any opportunity here to turn it up the field at any time he thought he might be able to outrun one more but Sam shields one of the fastest guys in the NFL on him by the shoelaces and make sure he didn't get the first down his fortune for Randall Cobb sets up at the nine yard John Lyon Griese box who created Carol coming here in 2010 whoo with backspin on the punt fair catch this ball for and made at the 40yard line they gets the ball for the first time of us when we come back to CenturyLink Field tonight's kickoff special being brought to you by Bo's official sound of the NFL by the new Samsung galaxy s5 that xpecting is here mercedesbenz experience truly great engineering today dealer TV if it goes up the sports man seems rocks came home degree filming tonight now Green Bay first possession second half 14 yard line the fingertips of medicine intercepted by Byron Maxwell flag is down and that's where we'll get tackled inside the ten shoving and pushing afterward the flag is down and the Seahawks offense is already coming out on to the fear is compiled away by his fans to get so many things going through the wrong item one of those you just kind of throw it into the hole of the zone and Aaron just let it a little too far and for Byron Maxwell what he did last year he got the play in the last five games through to some injuries and suspensions and all of a sudden he had four interceptions in those five games so at some point maybe Richard Sherman does get a chance Brandon browner is gone so Maxwell took over and here tonight starting on the other come here and that's sure another gorilla because he knows if he makes plays eventually offenses have to balance out no doubt it sets them up in the 8 yard line on the 1st and goal we'll see Beatson growing and complete curse was the intended receiver Williams covering it'll be second and goal same play they scored the touchdown on earlier that's that read option pass that time Tremont Williams I think it was did not take the bait he's off and inside and instead of coming up to attack Russell Wilson here after that fake he stayed back with his receiver he had to throw it away watch come on Williams his eyes on the quarterback takes a little fall step but then recognizes it good play second down and goal Lynx lining up deep in the back pictures way over the left side third down and goal early the third quarter and that 10 carries now for Lynch for 87 yards other guys we haven't talked much about max Unger right in the middle of their Pro Bowl Center nice job reaching and you just want to wonder I think that's the troy guy on in there yep and he did not play very much either after getting let go by the Minnesota Vikings and right now three receivers check to the right Lynch goes to the left when the pass is batted at the line of scrimmage and take it in at the three yard line Nick Perry covering on the play pass incomplete so fourth down and goal and in comes the field goal group Nick Perry has had a bunch of injuries but a big play here and for Russell Wilson that's the second tip ball that could have possibly been intercepted that is you sort of escape so sometimes you're good and sometimes you're lucky and sometimes you're both I think Russell Wilson is both mouseka now for a 20yard field goal attempt about the distance of an extra point and that's good to give them a projection Victor Paul Allen also owns the Portland Trailblazers of the NBA chairman of the Seahawks is on this team for well over a decade made about a gazillion dollars at Microsoft he was there with Bill Gates and there's the Super Bowl xlviii ring that the Seahawks and the staff will get you go back to Super Bowl one and that's what the Green Bay Packers wound up getting after we beat Kansas City where's the owners come in all shapes and sizes Steve Ballmer was there at and Microsoft infant than Paul Allen yeah you think owning the Clippers that's a little bit different too I would take either one of them eat the ring yes sir it still means the exact same deal through how many diamonds around true well unless you make a comeback your career records well the Legion of boom they're getting it done so far iron maxwell he's been picked on tonight with so far Jordy Nelson to come up with those big for the first time all night Jordy Nelson is over on Richard Sherman 1394 cashiers with : 31 yards tonight we toss it to lacy he's trying to get out of the backfield and does but not very far gain of two before he's forced out of bounds it'll be second down and eight and you know this offensive line now for the Green Bay Packers is dangerously thin polakov just yet but he's had a lot of injury issues they see Twitter that was definitely a concern second date lazy and we're gonna show one of the members of the Legion of boom Jeremy Lane is out with a groin injury he was limited in practice all week because of that groin injury he plays nicolau but no more tonight so he is on that probably means marcus burley will be in the other guy yeah Herald Simon is another guy that they like inactive tonight as well because early pick trade with the let's see if they go after him six and they will go to Nelson instead flirty Nelson pulls it in making the cats along the sidelines and that's enough for a first down sort of flip it back over and here's Jordy Nelson going to go a little back shoulder maybe a little closer look I kind of got it with just one hand that's what these receivers have gotten to now they sort of hold off the defender one hand and catch it with the other back to the ground Lacey's spinning away we're gonna get spun down Bobby Wagner coming in to clean it up at the end I tell you this this run defense has been the most impression impressive for me so far for the Seattle Seahawks yes that we know about the Legion of boom and then get all the credit the pass Russians up Michael Bennett and all those guys but Bobby Wagner if they can't stop the one they can't get into all their kind of coverage things that they want to do and it was about midseason they gave up a couple of big was Tampa and around doing a lot of tackling Rogers quick release and calm can't and it will be third down sir marcus burley covering on that place and they go his way we just paid for that six round draft choice here we go right here going to try and swing him up the boundary again same sort of play kind of pressure he must be feeling coming into the lead Picon well here just got here this week and that dealing the Colts third and flower finding time hits Bob over the middle for a first down tackled by Wagner and Chancellor and that moves the chains on the 3rd and 12 it's a gain of 23 yards let's give some credit here to the big guy Derrick's rod working against one of the best pass rushers in the game cliff April here's the guy was the firstround draft pick and ended up with a broken leg and some real issues hasn't been luck quick drop pass to the outside Jordan Nelson will take it and shove that amounts by the next will after he picks up six yards it'll be second down or four you've got Jody Nelson on the outside whenever they give him just a little bit of room an offensive players they're going to do those kind of offensive stiff arms and get away six dashes from ocean 45 yards the backfield bake the starts and then down at the line of scrimmage by Kevin Williams part of that famed Williams wall he and Pat Williams for many years in Minnesota they picked him up in the offseason and Kevin wavers one of the great players sort of at the end of his career now but they were really happy to get him he lost a lot of big guys out there red wine else because in this division against the you better have some as well in fact the Seahawks 46 guys who are regular starters late dang it in gettin out survey cross the field and broken up at the goal line maxvill staying right with him and not giving an inch it'll be fourth and five Wyatt Aaron Rodgers showed his arm strength he was all the way outside the numbers on the right and Jordy Nelson sort of throw up his arm all the way back to the left and he almost got this thing in there but if there was a little chance for maybe pass interference let's see the very end of this play good job though by Mack slow getting his head around so no interference I want that play clock we started because they got a lineup at least wine will they snap at the hill they do and Rogers almost get sent and then there's it's a cliff Averell so they game will they go for get the ball in great field position seven minutes left in the third night talks like that before that failed for that play you had seen McCarthy on the sidelines raising the palm to the sky meaning reset the play clock the play before that was that long pass to the goal line they did reset at the 40 the mic was still arguing the point during our commercial to no avail obviously as this is percy harvin who's going to gain 16 yards for a first down and Chris you got to think at this particular point in the game at 22 minutes to play in the game the Gulf War to midfield down by Tennyson very surprising cool well maybe you say okay you're gonna go for four years whatever you're gonna just do it but then you could tell it was screwed up well and at that point because they burned through all their timeouts at the first half I'm sure he was thinking I don't want to take a timeout here and so they ended up in a bad play they just weren't ready to snap the football on the cost of the sack you could tell you're not a sync when your coach is asking for the play clock to be reset Lynch going nowhere the snick Perry's come back in here today in it ended up having a pretty nice game he's had a lot of injuries during the course of his career but the feeling here is that they have so many different guys they can rotate in and out not a lot of defensive linemen but a lot of guys that can play multiple positions as Mike Neal and Nick Perry and Julius Peppers they can move them up they can move them down they really feel like that versatility is going to give them an edge throughout the year incomplete come on Williams breaking it up and boy what you know when you got a guy like Marshawn Lynch you're gonna use a lot of play action and Wilson did last year well this year as well we talked a little bit about Nick Perry we talked about jamming guys coming off the line of scrimmage that would be that he's a grown man out here he's grown in on the Green Bay side we need a win oh here comes to walk around they sniff that one out and haha Clinton dicks makes the tackle now they had no body and this amoeba defense with their hand on the ground look at that everybody's standing up now who's going to come where there they go come around there and Clinton Dick's comes up and makes a nice play so let's give some credit to Green Bay's defense that could very easily been a big turning point after going for it on fourth down and they get to stop absolutely that's exactly what they needed and now we're going to get the ball back still down by 10 points Your Honor is season the fair catch is pulled for there by Randall Cobb under five to play third twenty to ten see ya the house function there is your Super Bowl and the mouthing Smith that a great postseason in a simple that passed against San Francisco of the Sherman deflection and that Rogers is gonna lose the ball and it's loose in the end zone and covering it up to at least save five points in the end zone is Derek Sherrod Michael Bennett came in the sack bumble and then at least with a flag now down at the end of the play for the moment at least he save five points dereck Sherrod this is going to be a long night this is starting to look like the Super Bowl the Denver Broncos simply could not handle the outside pass rush of the Seattle Seahawks and it's starting to look more and more and more like that here very ruling on the field is a fumble recovered by the offense by rule but to see took off the tackle David Bakhtiari michael bennet so fast but also great with his hands watch him sweep the hands away of Derek's rod and come in and strip the ball out it's one thing to get the sack it's another to get that ball out and Michael Bennett anybody you talked to from the Green Bay Packers they said he is the guy that stirs the drink here that when you get him going bad things happen and every since Brian Belaga went out that's been a mismatch sex then it was the guy who started his career here but him last long with the Tampa and then they brought him back we had like nine sacks or something it's an but somehow he got out of there he comes back here and they become a multimillionaire now he was fantastic last year you can play him outside you can play him inside and dtackle you get him against some of those guards it's just not fair so we're like back in the Superbowl days with Justin Tuck when they first put him down inside so now instead of a free kick from the 20yard line it's half the distance to the goal and they kick off the free kick will come from the 10 yard line and Harvin will have an opportunity in all likelihood to run this one back be careful now Percy Harvin backed up wouldn't feel real good about this situation five hot and fitted with coverage here by Green Bay take him down at the 47 yard line but again Seattle starts this Drive from midfield you know it's interesting how is that jet sweep that they've been running Percy Harvin on Super Bowl II never stopped it in this game they never stopped you have three times for 38 yards you can pick up 13 yards per carry teeth bed what a factor he's going to be he can stay healthy this season it's part of the reason they could let Golden Tate leave pass Sidney Rice also retired in an off season another one of their white house trying to get that first down a little bit short though kind of about nine and a half over the middle would be right in Zach piller take a look at Percy Harvin of course I think played one regularseason game last year Super Bowl any way they can get him the ball in space that's the goal here's the little it happened so fast defenses don't even know where the ball is now you get them up to feel it it morning forehead just couldn't even get his hand and this guy is just going to be a huge second in a short yard and they give a turban and that's a first down peppers makes the tackle under four minutes to go now in the third quarter I'll tell you the other guy out talked about is Paul Richardson he was their top draft pick even though drafted in the second round MVP from Colorado and they talked about him and the speed that they he has is frightening and Russell Wilson says his hands are even better than a speed looks like a centerfielder or a shortstop making plays on the ball six feet in just 183 is Richie the it's away from Gillian's for the moment takes the ball to the 35 yard line and Marshawn is on his way to a triple figure night I mean almost on every carry now he has at least one broken tackle on that one there were two and when you're playing defense and you get a guy most running backs are going down they played that pretty well I got a guy hit him in the backfield Brad Jones but he couldn't get him on the ground so now it's you know checking 693 yards that'd be a first Miller it's taken out of bounds by four well we never talked too much about Zack Miller with the other weapons on this offense but he has been nothing short of fantastic tonight blocking pass rushing outside linebackers making that diving catch down the field coming across the field here you get a guy that can play like an offensive lineman sort of the true old classic blocking tight in and still make plays in the passing game that's strong I'm taking the way would have been a green big interception early again that's a great point two minutes left in the quarter on a first and ten Wilson just blows it away definite that second down there just aren't many young quarterbacks that do that as well as he does young quarterbacks never want to give up on a play right they always want to think they can do something whatever then they throw interceptions Russell Wilson at least three times in this game that I can remember has been outside in trouble nowhere to go throw it out of bounds hey we'll get him next time cerebrum he and Earl Thomas they get together they drive around and they go you know what you realize how lucky we are let's be legendary second down and ten katako but then three other Packers are right there I was interesting here in Russell Wilson talking about going to Children's Hospital with Earl Thomas and visiting a young lady there that had been recently paralyzed a sevenyearold and just how blessed he felt just to be getting back in the car and that was all they talked about on the way home and he was trying to do what those men have done already which is when backtoback Super Bowls so every one of those is in the Hall of Fame except for Brady and where she will be five years after his retirement 1310 who is the ameba gene Kranz again everybody up thought Carvin close to a first down back home there by Morgan Burnett yeah be for this you know I mean Dom Capers drawing up everything he can think of but somebody's got to cover that guy I haven't seen anybody can do that yet and I don't know any safety and foot so when you go to some of those empty sets and spread sets that means linebackers and safeties have to get involved and covering one of the great threats in the game let me finish you can take your immediate we can do with it first and ten from the 15yard line Wilson is going to keep it first now taking them all on the 3yard line there's that fourman rush again and if you're going to do there's going to be a gap and nobody does a better job than Russell Wilson when you rush for finding that little spot that he can wiggle through and then even more impressive he knew when to get down 322 10 Seattle and near threatening at dusk in the northwest tonight's aerial coverage is being brought to you by Geico now Michaels four styles worth Michele Tafoya the person 256 stricken the season games in the NFL it's a 12point game and she al trying to make it more a first and goal from the 3 yard line Lynch the running back they had to pull back in there as well there goes Marsh on into the end zone again for touchdown his second of the night they go three yards and nine plays five brushes and for passwords I'd say what James Carpenter does not make this play a year ago here he is coming right out here and hooking that defensive end that was playing outside of him an incredibly tough block he got him pinned and they got a walk in touchdown great play by James Carville I'll stuff in the five world champions looking every bit like world champions twenty nine to ten Sunday night is football night we go to Denver from here in 72 hours Sunday Night Football it'll be the coast and the Broncos football night America the NFL this is a sunlight in the Pacific Northwest Rock and night in this park Centrelink like the hide tackled at the 18yard line so the long road ahead Seattle has scored 19 on a points and Lee this kickoff special tonight brought to you by the soft surface the NFL by Nissan innovation of excites by Corona inviting it a fine viewer and by eight far from his Stadium maybe the Green Bay down by 19 and Rogers growing and it's caught for a first down by Jordy Nelson up at the 33 yard line the exact same play that they threw the interception on just threw it right into the gap between the linebackers one of the problems you have when you play against the Seattle team their linebackers are so athletic and get such deep drops it really creates problems for your passing game and so far tonight Rogers everything's been on and has dumped off here Lacey right into Chancellor you don't want too many of those battles but he did there and picks up the first down that gives you some idea what kind of man Eddie Lacy is Kam Chancellor probably the heaviest hitting safety in the game watch this collision on the back end here dancer comes up free shot stands them up but can't get him on the ground nice anyways we enchanted Green Bay needing a quick strike to get back in it hey she's spinning away this time got away from Chancellor once again to the 48 yard line Aaron Rodgers normally a downfield pastor but tonight when you look at his numbers passing by distance he's thrown only four balls more than 11 yards of 16 of 19 underneath and two of four beyond 10 and no yard that's what makes Seattle so great they this is a team Lika what you got to get the ball out let's go Rodgers music closed that's brought by Cobb not picture going to Seattle Sarasota the city 9 yard line is wrapped up there by Burleigh this marcus burley is going to take on a bigger and bigger role in seattle we already know they don't flipflop their corners so they tried to pick on Maxwell a little bit but now you bring in a new guy marcus burley and if you're gonna have a shot probably you're gonna say alright I've got to take my shot Randall Rogers that change Stark's said to reach back for it next to nothing there's a flag down homie offense 69 10yard penalty first down it's David Bakhtiari I think he was holding Bruce Irvin good to see Bruce Irvin back in after that hip surgery it's all they need around here is one more pass rusher he's had a few holding calls over the last year the grab around the shoulders and that's what they call it but Bakhtiari was really started all 16 left tackle Micra pin it down and doors for us in 20 you're second alone like ham chancellor because he makes the catch and the ball is spotted with the 37 yard line what a good throw by Aaron Rodgers watch this little sidearm dart in there Jordy Nelson finding out what so many others have and chancel is the enforcer in that far second than eight after the gain of quo and he's going to be a yard short of the first down though spotted at the 30yard line KJ Wright makes the tackle third and one now you're starting to see them picking up the pace a little bit they're trying to pin these pass rushers on the field for extended periods of time fourthorder first game gonna see Rogers flows and that little move to change the ball taken by Nelson Jordi to the 20yard line Jordi really had a little chance to run with that one but sometimes take a shot from damn Chancellor you remember at the next time good job though by Aaron Rodgers getting that ball out of his hand quickly nine catches the loss of the right foot sarch on the ground spinning away look at the rule next to the outside will he turn a lot of nothing into something takes the ball inside the ten that's just fantastic Michael Bennett's going to shoot down inside and almost hit James starts in the backfield and then it was just all starts remember the run that this guy had going to the Super Bowl he was fantastic historic for the short side of the field inside and takes the ball to the three yard line really second down and goal as we took down to ten minutes left in regulation where that was good by Andrew dieeee the Thai Thinh loud that when it happened and now you kind of see the look at Seattle they got their hands on your hips they've pinned those guys out they're not let them substitute long drive over five minutes guarded at the 18yard line of greenberg and throwing its plot for a touchdown bipod so exactly what we'd be needed not only a touchdown but to do it with some alacrity even though it did take 524 but at least nine and a half remain on the clock and after the extra point it could be a 12point game well when you get your running game going then you can do things like this with the bootleg nice job by Aaron Rodgers I think they're going for today RBI so to make it 11 was that letter you go to eight and three as opposed to 12 points means you're definitely going to need two touchdowns and the worst you come out of this filter touchdown get them to annotate the twopoint conversion in a few goal and pump fakes in and throws and the pass is incomplete then did the parlance of spade 13 point game with 931 in the fourth quarter in Seattle 29 to 16 selphie heaven huh beautiful night here though that was great day temperature the game time 71 not what's cooler than that Percy Harvin is back to receive on side well they're lining up now they spread it out this would not quite be a surprise onside kick and it won't be period well Harvin who's going to come out with it but he decides better so you know you look at the Seattle Seahawks and every year people say you know can a team repeat and of course you can repeat as we said at the beginning of the show but well you look at this team especially in this stadium counting postseason 17 and one over the last two years you're gonna have to beat them here eventually if you're gonna knock them off and you know I think back to that San Francisco and the championship game and and maybe how all these fortunes are different if they don't hit that fourth in 20 whatever that one play was and the play at the end of the game but you know those two teams you got to think they're still gonna be right they're battling to the end so the coach Pete Carroll taught 1401 Luke Wilson making the grab you go back to the last nine Super Bowl champions and what's not only amazing is that you haven't had anybody repeat but you only had one team that even won the postseason game you go all the way back to the the Patriots when they beat Jacksonville after the old five season that was it Matea bring you Bay's defense could get a three in out here because Seattle's defense was a little tired on that last Drive in a three now and get a right back on the field bonus may start looking a little different around here my name's Lynch it's gonna set up a third and six trying to chew a little clock up here one of the guys that they like is this one day tone Jones here and you'll see him slide right down the line of scrimmage and because they've got so many guys now that playing these versatile roles they're rolling these guys in last year with all the injuries they really didn't have that ability but they have a lot of top draft picks now they're all healthy and doing a pretty good job out here third and six they move all of the play clock will sing the flag and the pass is incomplete bust it up thereby shields flag is down at the 27 yard line it's a holding call which way is your gonna go with this four this is huge holding defense Brad Jones again Brad Jones gonna get beat right off the line of scrimmage here and as soon as he does he grabs and they are not going to do that that's one thing they've said from the very beginning if they see that Jersey tug they are going to call it that was third down I was off the field that's his second big holding call this game in so many levels because it's going to take a lot of time off the clock now take a good 35 seconds between play and this is Lynch taking the ball after the 31 yard line and the defense is going to get a little bit more rest that defense which you know we're always overstating things in football well you look back to that 85 Bears team and these guys were right there with him you know I played against the 85 Bears team in 86 so a year later and they beat us 41 to nothing at home and we had a good team and I didn't think I'd ever see a defense that could compete with that bunch but the way these guys played in the new sort of passing era of football last year Sanna was right there waiting second date screen is set up to lynch and leash will pick up the first down on a reception that takes him to the 45 and on the prior play his carry was a 17 and put him at a hundred and one yards here is the power of Percy Harvin they sent him across the motion they've been jet sweep infect pump fake that way come back the entire defense shifts over with Percy Harvin and they pick up a first down on the screen the other way to Marshawn Lynch great play calling I'll tell you Darrell Bevell hate to tell you see Ally ain't gonna be here long he is called a fantastic game here tonight no I mentioned before he had a couple of interviews last year and probably no reason his hear is that he couldn't be fired until they finished the Super Bowl Turban pizza for can tell you how many times tonight I've seen Green Bay Packers defenders and defensive linemen in the backfield and just unable to make a tackle I mean both these guys both the backs turbans breaking tackles it was bevel checking the play card that was just a killer holding call second and six sliding to a halt after he picks up the first down so tonight Seattle just killing the Packers on the ground 190 wonder how big is that loss of BJ Roger it's huge and in every aspect but anytime you get the running game going the way that it is and for the Green Bay Packers this is kind of an ongoing issue I think that they felt like maybe they had a few things solved with all their guys being back and healthy and nobody has solved the Seattle Seahawks five minutes in the fourth catches me just inside the 40 Lockett scored a touchdown earlier than the deccan some of these numbers NFL history just two guys 50 or more TD passes in a thousand no more rush yards in any twoyear span of course Cunningham did it a few years into his career he did it in 89 and 90 and Wilson did it in his first two seasons and Russell Wilson I love the conversation he had with Michael Jordan about okay it's one thing to make yourself better it's something else to make everybody around you better and that really hit home I think for Russell Wilson and he is very much leader this team to the 20 yard they just motioned him into the backfield from that Indian offense number 86 10yard penalty the replay second down I saw that block I didn't know if it was just a great block or a hole let's take a look a little hold a little flop little yeah you wanna call but he got the call I think that was more flop than hold nonetheless with for a team to go at second down and 12 back at the 46 yard line eating Drive and it's to stay in bounds and because that at the quarry on Hayward put his hand into his helmet and he's going to get a penalty on top of him well Hayward is signalling facemask like Russell Wilson did it to him personal foul face mask defense first out fear there's a stiff arm that's legal but that is trying to take his helmet off and that is illegal and the Green Bay Packers in many ways of selfdestructed they tried to go for it on 4th down never got themselves set missed that one too huge holding calls just not a good effort tonight by Green Bay against a very good team and you have to be almost perfect to come in here knock off this bunch but the big concern for me with the Packers right now the depth on that offensive line and whether or not they're going to be able to survive the entire season and went also you look at that green base schedule now Chris really important next week they go home to meet the Jets they'll be favored but then the next two games after that on the road in the division at Detroit and at Chicago pretty interesting now this is a good football team you know don't kid yourself but the sometimes when you look back on a season the one thing that gets you is when you get multiple injuries at the same position that more often than not will eat you up Ted Thompson's done a terrific job and his years is the exact 3p what a great moves him and you know as Seattle his DNA with the seahorses which takes it to the 15yard line I'd say it Darrell Bevell coming back to this again but I love the design they're killing them with this jet sweep with Percy Harvin so now they come over fake it and just give it to Marshawn Lynch and there's a humungous hole in there I mean Marshawn Lynch can win if there's no hole you give them a hole that's about eight yards wide you're lucky to get him on the ground 109 yards rushing for Lynch 14 more receiving 32 245 to go she's been in front of cool is late for a first down and the Packers gonna take a timeout he has to take it looks like it's going to be a fourth down here with 237 remaining in regulation 29 6 we'll be heading that way I understand we might get a few golfers at the game Sunday night huh Rory and if you swing thoughts tipoff oh that's right Bob uh Phil pretty good when you're a golfer you just need one name and everybody knows that you're talking about it fourth and one they line up to go for here in his cart and taken into the engine by Derrick Coleman the fullback and that will write a finish this one is the Seattle Seahawks will win this one going away no fail Mary this time this is a round this is the world champions looking light yeah hardest thing in the world fourth and one you've got big Marshawn Lynch in there and instead of blocking the fullback Derrick Coleman just slips out in the flat and there's nobody there Sam shields just nothing Darrell Bevell is just added to the list great night for him first touch of the night that's the point by Houston Seahawks have rolled up 401 yards and least 36 not too late to play nfl.com fantasy enjoyed free new mobile apps you can join drink and waiting from anywhere sign up in nfl.com slash fantasy this if you have Marshawn Lynch already happy tonight and there is a Sherman trying not to be that board is going to the kick team for stead of bounds at the 25 yard line with 2 minutes and 27 seconds remaining in the NFL 1014 opener talk about a shutdown corner or whatever you want to call them but you've had a great night when nobody even throws your way that's your reputation meanwhile they go Maxwell's way and they thrown out of nine times and completed six but he did have a big interception so now Green Bay and its own 24 yard the drop pass by Andrew Corliss second and ten and believe it or not there tried to getting up limping a little bit they had a little collusion out there as well so for Aaron Rodgers sometimes realize your fate and get the heck out of here but it's going to be a concern no doubt about it they're gonna have to do some help over to the right side for a little while they get this offensive line hopefully second and ten this is dawuan Harris the number three back and we go to Michelle well we saw Eddie Lacy take that hard hit from kam chancellor earlier he went to the locker room to be evaluated for a concussion was ruled questionable he had a concussion last season as well that took him out for a week out meanwhile no further status on Bryan Bulaga just out for the knee injury okay Thank You Michelle and before the snap here we have come upon the twominute warning minutes remaining at open a night in a 20point game Seattle looking like the range Super Bowl champions so a big opening night for Seattle latina counting postseason games has won 17 of 18 Plus when this one is in the books its third bro and gets it away in prom black is that on however back at the line of scrimmage at the 24 yard line John Berry is not moving fast holy it's TJ lang kind of hold of Michael Bennett now TJ Lang is gonna get beat around by Michael Bennett and like so many people have done you get beat you save your quarterback and takes off the board a pretty spectacular play by Aaron Rodgers he could do a lot but he can't do it all and give credit tonight they stopped the running game Byron Maxwell marcus burley their backup slot they had their two best receivers over there Jordy Nelson and Randall Cobb and they couldn't get it done I mean it's just as simple as that and the pressure got there in the secondary third and 13 where the secondary's build shot and completely leaves in a boom Rodgers had a lot of time they don't leave too many openings in the back end great reaction there by Earl Thomas I know he's disappointed didn't come down with that interception what it wouldn't intense young man that is I mean his whole life is dedicated to the game of football he is the first one there and the last one to leave and you hear that sometimes but it's serious with this guy he's there at the crack of dawn he stays late he lives for football just flies around the field I love watching him play one of the great players in the league the statute is fair coin at the 23yard line by Brian Walters well when your defense is number one to get to the Super Bowl eight teams have made it when they were ranked number one in points and yards allowed and there it is the last Super Bowl before the aflnfl merger was the Chiefs the only loser would be in Super Bowl for the Chiefs and the Vikings in met one banks ramp matriculating the ball down the field that was great and you know one thing that probably won't be talked about in this game Aaron Rodgers took his team down the field to get his glove right back in it they were down by whatever 13 12 13 something like that and then Seattle's offense did what you have to do you're going to be champions you then answer the call you take it the other way for the game flinching touchdown and Russell Wilson and company were so razor sharp tonight as was their defense they can run up where they left off a couple of kneel downs will end it so Pete Carroll area is the most youthful 62 year old going on 63 next week guile ever see but you know you think about him of all the things with Carroll he 20 years ago he's the coach of the New York Jets that lasted one year he went to New England in the late 90s Bob Kraft had inherited Bill Parcells so Parcells leaves after they lose the Super Bowl and then Carol comes in for three years and then crafts goes out and hires Belichick so there's a guy who got sandwiched in between Parcells and Belichick we might sandwich a couple of Super Bowls with this football team but you know everybody thinks that Pete's a guy you get along with and he's great and they play music at practice he said no it's the same formula Bill Parcells use discipline discipline football players win games and he teaches discipline and these guys he talks about it being a laboratory that he had at USC and he said I'm doing the same thing now we did at USC the formula works but the guys are discipline we're gonna win pretty good century for long mr. Carroll to national championships even though they took one away at SC a Super Bowl and a big start tonight and a quest to do it again Seattle dominates in the 2014 opener wending the game by a score of 36 216 coming up next to you Volkswagen postgame after these messages",

  "transcript": "put his hand quickly depending on target yeah they've been able to run the quick route ski of this slice adopted to the wide receivers now I think the second half they have wonderboy more effectively than they did in the first out shifting store because it so via season and when you're on the road in the second half and continue to follow the undisciplined play in the selfish place they're going to catch up to you you're going to lose football game exactly what'll be interesting to see very early on in this second half if perhaps cooler heads prevail cause it was a very ugly check penalty's late hits three players ejected about all of it I'll tell you this is the first halftime report I didn't talk any football with either coach I walked out with Tom Coughlin who was so angry / disappointed because as we know all week he's been stressing to his team this is what the Rams do they're trying to bait us we have to stay cool do not add fuel to the fire he said we definitely have not done that he walked off the field shaking his head just saying this is not the way you play the game this is not how it's meant to be playing Tom all right Lauren thank you very much first down and basin except through a 12yard gain how about Jeff fisheries side of the ledger well after Jeff Fisher obviously it's a different feeling over there but he did say right away there's no place for that in the game but he also said it happened it's over we can't get caught up in that we now need to focus on how to win this game which comes down to we have to finally execute Rams have won three in a row the Giants on a modest two game laxaria trying to win their final two and close out the year with a 500 records they lost last weekend it's the 11th consecutive year without a winning season some of the numbers from the first half clearly tilting towards a giant side the rushing yards for the New York Giants has got to come into play they've got to run the football successfully on first and second down here in the second half control the time of possession really let the big man up front take control this game because if they do not and they get themselves in third and long this Rams defense will take advantage a nice when they put themselves back into foot Mayson lowers his shoulder takes on Antrel Rolle is up to the 37 yard line it brings up third down and five for the land roll the free agent at the end of the year it's been written about talked about a great deal final year of a fiveyear contract after he left Arizona same holds true on a giant defense for that man Jason pierrepaul they play it looks like Paul jumped early Vegas throwing down to sideline it's intercepted and this might be the second interception that is not to be for Dominique Rodgers Cromartie this would be an automatic first down if it is offsides outside number 90 defense fiveyard penalty any result in the penalty is the first half Shawn he'll do a great job with the cadence changing up giving the heart counts see jpp start that one early get a free play and like I said this is the second time Dominic garages party has had an interception the first one massive offense on them this one the defensive also we had a very interesting conversation yesterday with Jason pierrepaul about his imminent free agency at the end of this year seems like everybody is not Flint and or talked about who frequently is said look I want to stay with the Giants and he said that to us yesterday but he followed that up immediately with basically make no mistake about it if there's a lot of fooling around and a lot of hesitating if they able to get on the same page I will look forward to exploring free agency and hearing what other teams have to say he said I will test the freedom free agency market i that he said I'm 25 years old which is amazing you don't think about it but when he was drafted he was 20 years old at 25 he said his best football is ahead of him and he said if it's not in New York unfortunately they'll have to take this task somewhere else because he thinks that he has got a lot left and see the basket said he's played through stinger for the first time in his career this year what does that mean Dave we hear that term all the time when a player is playing all year with a sting a stinger is almost whiplash when you get that jerk that twist that torque to your neck where you're pinching a nerve when it happens it feels like there's a cigarette going out inside your neck and it is the worst thing and the problem with stingers are they continue to linger because it takes so long for your nerves to regenerate when you're playing football and you're in the NFL 17 straight weeks of pounding you're not going to get rid of out until the season we're down six blitz coming so they shot to the second time from jamia McLain today there are few of the great design I mean look you've got Roma's there's only two people in the stance you got Carrie went up in a twopoint stance they fire out with clean confusion on the offensive side of the ball no communication with the offensive line and complete pass and another big hit by Jamil McClain on Shawn hill just poor poor communication and poor performance right go on that third down inside the 15 20:13 Giants have the ball for the first time to the second half when we return Giants get the football for the first time in America the odds raelians took a big hit from Jim Norris Jenkins and in Jenkins who's down on the ground we talked about earlier now when Williams is coming action gets a little steam behind him more times than not it's andre williams who delivers a shot to power with his lower body his ability to continue to hit just his leverage he just gets underneath b1 lowers the boom looks definitely like a shoulder and that we're just talking about a stinger you could tell he definitely got hurt on that one fortunately chinos Jenkins was able to get back on his feet and ran to the sideline a DJ games or other stuff corner was injured early he has returned sucking down and poor at the big new 49yard reception on the opening drive to the Giants in the first quarter and that one will move the chains up to the 30 here the 29 yard line very nice catch very nice job at the bottom had a bunch formation you know they had Ogletree run me out Rueben Randle ran the inside post at free things up and cuts it back to the inside out across the 15 runs through one tackler still on his feet inside the 45 all the way down to the 25yard line we just talked about his power and his ability to run through people well he just ran through Rodney McCloud I'm that one nice blocking at the point of attack we see JD Walton get to the second level to make the key block and Laurinaitis not Jerry Williams just accelerating through the hole and having a huge game we said that you know he may not have the yards per carry that you want to have on the season but that was momentum changes play and that's what they need out of this County flag comes in late after the 49 yard run by the number 65 offense 10yard penalty remains first down William B DS third penalty of the game three holding calls he's got to make sure that he's careful and gets his hands inside granted I know that you're going up against tough guys but when you're playing the left half position you've already been called once they're eyeing you down for the rest of game 10th penalty against the Giants and we're just a little more than 5 minutes into the second half on the team that averages six a day this is undisciplined football you know Kaufman is not like number 97 these are fancy automatic it's only the third penalty on the Rams in this game that's a fifth personal foul on Eugene Sims this season which is just unbelievable you see Eli Manning already has the ball let go the little extra hit and that smash down to the ground you know officials are going to do whatever they can to protect quarterbacks Sims in his fifth year out of to West Texas a.m. and we mentioned David just said it his fifth personal pal penalty and that is more than any player in the league and remember Sims is a backup defensive line jinora's Jenkins is just checked back in for the ran back down go Williams on first down to the ten Daniel fells on the backside of that play had a nice cutoff for Andre Williams he was able to cut that ball right off of him right behind him and to continue to move the chains and you know we talked about it and I said right away he's starting the second half they needed to do a good job of establishing the run and sticking to it and they most certainly have we missed nice gave the friend of the eye and they get it to Williams Laurinaitis wrapped him up but not before williams is able to get them to seven yard line so bring a third down and three one sack for each team so far in this game today science again throwing up coming down at 3:00 they do into the enzone is Reuben Randle and that is a touchdown for the Giants another nice play design earlier in the drive we saw Rueben Randle take the inside oval tree take the outside this time they flipflopped in that bunch Rob this time oval tree took the inside Rueben Randle off of that little pick rub takes the outside is able to extend it and get that touchdown very nice drive very nice play call by Ben McAdoo in this offense then some join going on between the offensive and defensive lines after the touchdown brown to black to make it a 27:13 game in their jaw and again Randall the touchdown this his third of the year welcome back to st. Louis where this crowd is still standing and sharing a moment ago carbo grant death his wife knew he was going to surprise a family today back from Afghanistan is then Casey did not go husband and dad just landed back to the United States of America this morning yeah that doesn't bring you to tears I'm not quite Christmas season those two young ladies have down I Rams need to get something going you 7:25 to play in the third quarter they're down by a pair of touchdowns first down catch me five took the tie end and that's a good way to get a grind start about a big game of the 11 dams not much to speak up on offense a 1 turnover by Hill he's had an interception when they've given it to Mason he's had some decent runs they just haven't really committed to the one mark they're settled this season when tre Mason has over 19 calves their successive enemies over 80% they've gotta feed him the football here in the second half try to find some balance on the offensive side wall swing it on first down dangerous 12 catch laid over there by the sixyear veteran and ignore it out of Rutgers a native of New Jersey is Britton than his first five years in Tennessee three of those while Jeff Fisher was a head coach Kenny Britt a bigbodied wide receiver very physical and this is the best season that he's had in his career since 2010 so the reemergence of him Jeff Fisher bringing him here to st. Louis and giving him the second chance after all the off the field problems he's been a guy who's taking advantage of this new opportunity that he's been there's Masoner that'd be good enough to move the chains on second and to ease out across the 30 up to the 32 yard line tonight on Fox Sports live get a complete update on what's going on in the NFL you'll get highlights analysis of all the games Randy Moss Donovan McNabb on Fox Sports live that's at 11:00 o'clock Eastern on Fox Sports one streaming live on Fox Sports go five forty to play in the third quarter first down to st. Louis and up to the 39 yard line once more Kenny Britt an injured player Rogers Cromartie now for the Giants all right you know about the Cardinals and the defending Super Bowl champion Seahawks

remaining unclaimed playoff spot this is why you have salute we love the NFL in December late in the season and that's been the division that everybody's been watching this season everybody over 500 by two games I mean it's gonna come down to the wire here and that's exactly what we want as fans of this great game we talked about earlier rogers club party all of the injuries he's had to deal with this season and the one that's plaguing most recently as his shoulder and you wonder if he didn't react reveille tit they're just by his body action did you see them holding on to that left arm grabbing it by the wrist and that usually means you're holding it there to support your your arm and your shoulder and to kind of hold it into place if you can and the straight right arm which generally leads you to believe it could be a reactivated shoulder injury there you know you played for Tom Coughlin David deal over the last ten years before stepping away from the game at the end of last year with everything that went on at halftime what do you think he had to say to the team I think he told the team to come out here and and just play focused football ain't disciplined here make sure that we take control our being let's run the ball successfully defense let's step up and continue to play the way that we were but let's play sound disappointed for Paul because coach Coughlin throughout the entire time that I've played for him and now that you'll see him he harps the two biggest things penalties and turnovers absolutely lose football games there's no doubt about that and when you're in a game like this and you've got over ten penalties like they do right now the margin for error is so slim regardless of what to score the game right now back and ask you a little bit about the future of Tom cloth okay we have the Giants three weeks ago they lost seven straight game and steps out of bounds as long as you're close to Coughlin's has won the last two weeks you felt at the time that the Giants needed to do with a couple more games between that point and the end of the year well here they've now won their last two and a lot of reports in and around New York are virtually saying the Tom Coughlin is coming back next year as head coach although there's obviously no official word on that from anybody the Mehra's matricies even coach Coughlin is not talking about it and they won't figure it out at the end of the year it's just so hard to imagine this guy is not they had coaching the Giants have never been surprised that Coach Coughlin doesn't talk about it and let's face it this is far from the first time that he's been in this situation where his job has been online I mean I think that I mean even two three years into his job they were already calling over here job and and that's the thing about Coach Coughlin is we can week out Dan India frankly intensity he brings the energy and you wouldn't expect that he is eh he is because of the winning bid he approaches the game and how his ex around this new generation of football players he's found a way to adapt to be able to speak to them and communicate clearly with them and we've heard this football team rally around him you'd say that we want to continue to grow and win football games for Coach Coughlin so when your players are saying that and they're responding off of it it's a clear sign that he hasn't lost a lot secondly who are you gonna replace it with you're talking about Coach Coughlin who has two Super Bowl trophies is in the top three of all time wins right now of coaches that have been cultured during this time period go to the Brian to coach who the New York see it better be a face with projections and a fat one that's reputable because you can't go down Fifth Avenue with just any quote New York's Karrie by mason inside the 15 down to the 13th good carry on first town say when the man walks in a room you can't help but have respect he has earned others respect not only what he's done as a head coach but the way he is is a man this is a good man who's been a good coach and won a lot of games for a long time he's somebody all can and should look up to Masek trying to get to the first down Parker needed to get to be 11 hello swag now number 69 office then yard penalty remains second down you know now the flipside of it all some would say this is a third year in a row the Giants haven't gone to a playoff so you know look there are certainly arguments on both sides but just watching the way the Giants are closing out the year and you can say well who are they beating well you know what they need a Washington team last week that lost to the Philadelphia Iger that beat the Philadelphia Eagles yesterday so so no games initially getting more again yep over 20 players on injured reserve which is the most pot I think in Giants history and he's installed the completely different offensive before today and there is a touchdown reception tongue Lance Kendricks for dear tightend out of Wisconsin and all of a sudden the Rams within a touchdown Lance Lance Kendricks is an absolute threat down the scenes they look for oneonone matchups against linebackers on that one you see mark pers leagues tries to jam them he doesn't disruptive rough his routes enough can't get back into coverage they beat him over the top and he's able to continue to fight through that run through Antrel Rolle trying to come over to make the tackle and to get a touchdown going the Rams brought in Jared Cook prior to last year it took a lot of catches and a lot of playing time away from Kendricks whose career was off to a great start but the touchdown there is still of the season we've got a good one here at st. Loup nice ER drive and a touchdown for the Rams ten plays 90 yards 23 yard touchdown reception by Kendricks and Hill perfect on the fly hitting six out of six this right now is the time in the second half when the st. Louis Rams defense turns it up a notch the thing about this is in the third quarter the brands putting points on the board and this time there there's an economist they went to ran out of his Cindy series of the third quarter and didn't have the first out of the court des back up to the 18 yard line very funny new series coming to poxy January called Backstrom star as Rainn Wilson has a brilliant but eccentric policeman who solves the toughest crimes that's a series premiere Thursday January 22nd on Fox been a very quiet day where this finally defensively a loss of the yarn coming up to make the tackle you know it's always interesting the Rams came in with all the pomp coming into the year based on what they did last year first round draft picks along that defensive line of law Donald this year Michael blockers and of course Robert Quinn going back to 2011 they got off to a terrible start they had six sets in the first eight weeks of the season they've been piling them up lately a lot like this Giants defensive line man it that should have been intercepted by Gaines and he's hurt collided with a crossing receiver it looked like Beckham its friendly fire TJ MacDonald was coming over to lay the big hit Beckham saw it coming and was able to slip out of the way and actually hit his own guy AJ Gaines his helmet came off you look at it slow motion it's very different than in real speed when TJ McDonald had basically launched his body like a missile to try and hit Odell Beckham jr. whom he was anticipating would make the catch on that throw and wound up hitting his own man EJ Gaines who had to leave the game already today with another injury obviously no intent there by McDonald but you can understand by watching dad play along why the NFL is so concerned about players launching at another player in slow motion it's one thing fullspeed that's a weapon now certainly blessings to be counted as EJ gains is able to sit up and now stand up and walk off the field I don't know how it looked on television we do our best to give you an idea of what it's like all the time to see that in person scary stuff let's check in back in LA with Curt Menefee well it's all but over in the NFC East Tony Romo four touchdown passes in three quarters this one to Jason Witten part of a 35 to nothing lead over Indy the Cowboys when they win the NFC East and officially eliminate the Eagles Tom and David all right Kurt thank you very much cleaning the blood it looks safe off of the field was that still him and still him he got up started to walk off and had to go back down on one knee well maybe they saw something that they need to do that blood you're talking about yeah cuz he's got that tall covering up his mouth I think it's either his nose or his mouth is bleeding yeah that was it's a vicious head certainly we we hope that EJ games is going to be alright we're just thankful yep I've got four that young player with a promising career ahead of them not sure every kid got up earlier born and raised in Independence Missouri they're giving up one touchdown on the scene down of ten under a minute to go in the third quarter to the sevenpoint lead Lord Walder Beckham and that's all she wrote for a touchdown 80yard touchdown for the remarkable Odell back on the Junior second touchdown today his 11th on the year already the Giants rookie record holder four touchdowns and receiving yards him on the inside here they're gonna Rueben Randle hen he's just gonna take a double move he's gonna fake like he's hitting it outside runs the fly right through the middle of that team down the sea just explosiveness his ability to get open starts top clean breaks not to mention the time that he's had an old L Beckham jr. are clearly on the same thing six catches a hundred ten yards for Beckham that is the eighth consecutive game he has had 90 receiving yards or more that is one game shy of an NFL record set by Michael Irvin in 1995 his Odell Beckham jr. right on the inside like we said you see the coverage trying to come over and help you see the one jump to jump inside to take Rueben Randle only one bad side Rodney my mistake TJ McDonald is a neighbor to come over for the bat support he's drawn to the opposite side of the field and I don't know how you take your eyes off the number 13 he's the one that you should be watching holy line Manny told us ed look good you know when you do all the blitzing the Greg Robinson does in this defense to try and hit the quarterback that is their goal to hit the quarterback before he can find an open receiver but if you don't get to the quarterback there are big plays to be made there most certainly are because of when you bring that and you bring the different amount of pressures and you bring the blitz if you don't get home you're putting corners and defensive backs one on one and when you do that against an explosive player like Odell Beckham jr. you don't get home on that blitz he's going to take advantage of it so that people have a chance to time it in the final game of the regular season next week you'll need 90 or more receiving yards he's always having a good time with his mates they say that he could have been on the national soccer team when he was a kid he didn't want to go overseas but just a young enthusiastic player who loves the game of football and obviously he loves to perform and entertain and that's for sure still a long way to go in this 139 seconds in a third quarter Briar's coming off a template 90yard touchdown drive Idol shoved out of bounds in a first down up to the 34 let's go downstairs Laura open I'm going to update you on to injuries unfortunately it's a busy day today EJ King we saw him leave on the cart in the locker he's being evaluated for a head injury or concussion as her rogers Cromartie we saw him leave Turner's have been working on him since he went out it is a burger Tom all right boy thank you very much the double reverse and look out Austin with blockers in front of him what a play by Paul to fight off the wouldbe blocker and at least lost and dead that is an excellent play by Jason pierrepaul now wait a minute now we sure if we have a penalty flag the the officials are gathering back at the 30yard line I still don't see a penalty flag down there it is far sideline illegal motion offense fiveyard penalty still first down and the end of the quarter alright so that's the end of the third quarter Giants 34 Rams 20 box NFL SUNDAY continues after a break from your local Fox station 34:20 as we begin the fourth point alongside vote a deal Laura behind firefox clean which is you enjoyed the early merry christmas happy holiday season all of his own in a contact down the field between Zack Bowman and Kenny Britt but those heavily ply sack Bowman definitely I think got away with one this one Shawn Hill had definitely put that one out there more for Kenny Britt because if he would have that would have been a touchdown that is surprising that he got away with that little touch pull it down to that point my second dad police up to the 44 yards short of the first down after the pebble he'll 18 out of 24 touched down an interception $198 Eli Manning has had a brilliant day twenty of twenty three over 300 yards three touchdowns no interceptions no turn by 20 Ram sold for three or thirty dad wrapped up by Carrie wind about the interception earlier in the game started with canard ripping off of the edge he actually had two guys going to block one for Sean Hill to step up carry win with the relentless pressure was able to come up with another big set for this Giants defense in the forced Rams to pot now Beckham Junior waits on the punt for the shiny pecker angling towards the sideline a fair catch by Beckham inside the box put a good day again for the rookie Kerry win welcome back to st. Louis we talked about both these quarterbacks a moment ago his offensive line you can't begin to describe the this group is done here today on the amount of penalties there love tackle BD is had today what three holding penalties but the bottom line is we have not even called Robert Quinn's name so BD might have three tackles but Quinn does not have a second no he does not you just think about the rest of the group there and Donald doesn't have any sex or many pressures Chris long neither you've got to give a lot of credit to this Giants offensive line we said earlier in the game the challenge they were the key players for this game they have definitely risen to the challenge going up third down and five James Laurinaitis starting his 95th consecutive game at middle linebacker for these Rams he is closing in on Merlin Olsen's alltime record for tackles and franchise history what an outstanding player second round in 2000 giant six out of ten on 30 day that come again and he's close to midfield he Pete Tremaine Johnson down the sidelines at Johnson the man replacing the injured EJ games once again shermaine Johnson is going to take that inside leverage he's going to try to press him tries to get off of him lets it go doesn't get a single hand on the rear out I know that you're trying to use the sideline as it found you but you've got to make sure that you're tight and hog on to that hip of that route so that you can either get a hand on those four sma'da bodies touchdown his body and now a couple of players out of the midfield line getting tangled up and again Alec Ogletree is right in the middle of all of it standing over and straddling John Jerry while the tria the late hit well out of bounds in the second quarter which prompted two mainly with ejected Preston Parker probably should have been thought out twice and there's a big net leading with a tannaz Rams team is really bordering on dirty football here today and there might be a lot of people who don't like that don't want to hear it but there have been some incredibly by their late hints or unnecessary hits that have occurred in this game now they're talking about it perhaps you're not going to see you this way all that attention was directed right at Odell Beckham jr. we heard lor Oakman saying that these defensive backs were not happy with the way he spun the ball goes out to my Virgo you can tell they were debating and thinking about it one official believing that McLeod was leading with his helmet and he's down there talking to Beckham I agree with it it doesn't look like it was about suspect we're still in it was all was untouchable fair enough the officials in Seoul little bit differently as it comes do you get it right you know look I'm not gonna back down for what I just said a moment ago and it's not getting on a soapbox but there have not been any late hits by one team in this game there have been a number late hits by the other team in this game up against this defense we go up against a Brett Williams defenses and often swine dies out apology because they're gonna try to get they're going to try to get you out of you again incident by far the more penalized team today 34 to 20 with 1028 to PUD yep 34 220 is will punt of the way the question is if they draw ball size which would be an automatic first down much was made leading up to this game about all the fake Bugsy fans unfortunate number 98 fiveyard penalty you know about all the fake punch Jeff Fischer has tried as a head coach almost thirty of them in his career three of them this year and Paul Schwartz a writer back in New York actually went digging around after his initially said the Tom Coughlin's had never tried it he's tried it twice but this is just as good as a fake punt this give him the heart count we call that and saying no brainer watch the ball he saw him switch quickly thinking that they were going to go for the first down offensive leave they run out the punt unit they gave a little quick one and you see the little quick point by Mark Breslin and they went off on it first hand 10:28 deploy in my voice Williams if they're gonna get a holy call on JD wall only number 65 on 5th 10 yards LD still first down if she caught William BT well sometimes they mess up those numbers he'll think 55 still 65 and well could have been on 55 I thought it was on JD Walton trying to reach Michael brokers there at the point of attack he's seen him almost get his hip arm around and almost hug him at the hip to not give up that penetration so that's why I thought JD Wallace come on Paul that is the hands effective got a night's block from Ogletree you're right town great block by Ogletree and brendan fells out there Daniel fells out there to set that up and to spring them for an extra extra gain medicine the thing about it Odell Beckham jr. or a player like Devon Austin on the other side just get him into space let them use their athletic ability and their explosiveness to go he makes a catch too short of a first down but after the giant penalty it is a third down coming up I know earlier in the game I called out Andre Williams first block and given up the set the TJ McDonald but since that point Andre Williams has done a fantastic job picking up glitches and making sure that he is the aggressive going to stop them at the corner cannot continue the Russian get any type of pressure second that's it again and nearly deceptive bugs indoors ejected Nords jenkins over the last three years has six defensive touchdowns which is the most in the NFL he's a player that will gamble he will take shots he will fall off and that is one that he usually comes up with so be a long field goal try but much like Sir line on one side Josh Brown has more than enough leg for the 52 yard this is plenty good enough both of these guys can really support 30 career vehicle of 50 plus cars for Josh Brown that is six most alltime giant saintly to look at part of our dynamic duo there in the booth legendary Bob's dinner our producer today Greg stopa Tony our director 37 to 20 in favor of the New York Giants because that so much talk this week after really not a lot of talk at all about for years now has been enacted mercy about the possibility of going to Los Angeles again we'll get back to that in a minute a reminder Big East basketball a marathon coming your way on New Year's Day begins at 11:30 a.m. Eastern goes all the way to midnight only on Fox Sports 1 straining live on Fox Sports go Stan Kroenke on the right the owner and chairman of the st. Louis Rams lotta talk as recently as two weeks ago but the Rams might be leaning static wonky odds of the lion band recently purchased over by the nowdefunct Hollywood in Los Angeles and no perhaps he would be interested in moving this franchise back to Los Angeles of course but where they came over 20 years ago but then the San Diego Chargers this week announced that they would be playing in San Diego next year and of course they've long been willing to make the trip north to Los Angeles the Raiders are still always a possibility and while no announcement has officially made here in st. Louis if the Rams are definitely coming back their lease is up they may be forced to just go along together wall on a yearbyyear basis some felt this could have been the last home game ever for the Rams in st. Louis it's actually fun I was actually talking to Peggy sitting right next to us in the booth and she was saying the same thing shoes this wasn't the last time that she would be sitting in your season two or 1960 the Cardinals alive they had a couple of the NFC East titles but not a lot of success they took off for Arizona under the Bidwell ownership route 95 almost 20 years ago had the great success under dick per Mille but you know the history of football professionally in st. Louis whether it's a Cardinals for the Rams outside of the 99 year in a year here at a year there around there has not been a lot of success which you know generally would lead somebody to believe that fans don't cover the games and you know they're not supporting the team nothing could be further from the truth is there's a penalty flag down 37 to 20 out there then yard penalty remain there down this year the Rams have their highest home attendance average since 2008 they have filled the stadium to 89% capacity and it is a sterile Stadium and what you have to remember is now there is only one franchise in the NFL that has lost more games over the last ten seasons than the st. Louis Rams yet their fans have done a I think a flight supported job I think you agree David er of getting behind a franchise which is doing nothing but losing not only the last decade but really a lot of losing over 48 years of football at st. Louis they boy been to the playoffs eight times in 48 years none man would sit here talking about all this you just it just for me it would just be so weird or not just wrong to not have a team here in st. Louis in this great great state and you know we've talked to fans around here we talked to a lot of people and they couldn't see not having his team you know coming to watch them on Sundays regardless of the record this is something that becomes part of these families and tradition and you know let the state of Putney sit next to us she said she would do with himself and carbines and have the experiences that they've had with not only each other but they have had with their kids as well well perhaps Peggy and so many others will have a chance to watch Rams football next year but you can rest assured I mean once the season gets close next August since September a lot of this same conversations gonna strike okay this is the most penalized single fit ballgame for two teams combined this year along the sidewalk well out of balance clock stops to 709 to play in the game and the rains will punt last night brandy stated right they teamed it over the last three plus seasons has been among the best in the NFL when they picked off class I have that stadium is empty the waves they've already been eliminated as and there weren't a lot of empty seats in this building this gave a game you know there weren't and that was actually surprising overs sitting there watching again we couldn't believe in a game like that on this type of we can close the holiday set up would be a jampacked seems like as this season it's not we're talking about rookie records Giants team records the Odell Beckham jr. is time his two games before this one he had 23 catches for 273 yards and four touchdowns what about today eight reception at least touchdown is local and then the amyloid touchdown just a moment ago that's one of the most under the fence about him is not only just his talent physically but mentally how sharp and how smart that he is and how well that he's been able to pick up this offense they line them up all over the field and his first came as a giant after coming back from the it should lined up at five different positions on the football field so when you have a type of player like this who's not only just dynamic and as it's explosive is athletically his gains all between his ears and that's the one thing that Ben McAdoo and Eli Manning Falls for us is that he is a student of the game and his ability to watch film and understand defenses and coverages has only gotten better and better and better with many conductance teammates and Beckham himself tried to hang on to that one onehanded they was punted away how about a little bit more ah no bill document especially moving forward Laura and making sure he stays on the path then you know some other guys tend to drift off that path in the big city it's nice about talking to him and talking about him because it's where David's had a hearty studies football he's studying what to do off the field just as hard we've heard stories how he's talked to LeBron James he's talked to Jerry Rice Michael Jordan Odell's the one that's reached out to them so I asked him when you called these guys can you meet with them what are you asking and he said my biggest question is what does it take and I said what's the when you've gotten to all of them and he said every one of them Jordan Jerry Rice has said and LeBron handle your business on the field off the field comes with it don't focus on that learn what you're doing on the field first and that is what the Giants see the most in front well you certainly hope that he does it the right way I mean David you played with a lot of guys a meeting in New York well you could be the the talk of the town the toast of the town and then you're the town goat and he doesn't take a lot of time in between go from hero to zero overnight and it's all about the way that you handle yourself and prepare yourself each and every Sunday and they couldn't be more right if you want to do things off a football field your profession you guys in between those lines on the football field everything else takes care of itself but if you don't take care of business out on the football field all the extra stuff does not matter penalty flag again holding 479 offense 10yard penalty ninth penalty of the game on the Rams you know we talked about the offensive line of the Giants in a job they've done today you know you can give a lot of credit to the offensive line as well for the Rams today in the Giants in their last three games had 22 sacks I only have one of them now two of them today that's a wig Barney Greg robbers and has been lined up all day long on Jason pierrepaul that'll be flag again and now another flag comes in there are 2,000 defense holding number 95 personal foul penalty to find personal foul roughing the passer number 99 15yard penalty automatic first down that is a first roughing the passer penalty against a New York giant this season you see Colin Jenkins continue with that rush that ball is clearly out of Sean Hill's hands and gets a penalty for the late hit under five minutes to go here in st. Louis Rams came in winners of two animal tribes for 446 I from winning miracle of what there's a seven rip a gain of nine nine hits on the quarterback couple of sacks we mentioned earlier and Hill has taken a couple of bruising hits in this game Jamil the play guy down in a giant territory boy it sets up so many big games David deal I mean forget next weekend you've got two huge games in basically the next thirty hours coming up later tonight you have what in essence is a title fight we're the NFC West Cazares a touchdown left all alone Chris Gibbons complete breakdown there for the Giants and now a chance to draw with intent the garage is Cromartie here is going oneonone initially but he thinks that stevie brown inside is going to come over and help because he passes them to absolutely no i'm and that's an easy touchdown for Chris Gibbons the point after now by Sir line David deal I want to lean on you a little bit here over the next well let's start with the next 24 30 hours Arizona all the way down to its fourth quarter back they have had an incredible year the job of loose areas is done they are at home later tonight with a chance to win their division against the defending Super Bowl champions he ought to event on quite a roll your thoughts on that in Arizona win that game I think they are capable of winning that game because I'm a very big fan of Coach Boyles the defensive coordinator for the Arizona Cardinals his ability to just completely disrupt and stop offenses he glitches on run plays he'll go blitz zero on first down it does not matter he will do whatever he can to ruin the timing of any other team coming into there having said that the way that Seattle has been playing been determined they've stressed on how important they've been leaning on one another to compete against one another in practice which they felt the dead did not do well enough earlier in the season and they're going out these Sundays and are playing sound convincing football right I think the Seattle Seahawks win tonight I don't well they don't want to get to you about the decision that John Fox has to make about Peyton Manning looking ahead at tomorrow night Denver in a big time game in Cincinnati obviously the Rams thinking about an onside kick here they have Odell Beckham jr. in the second line if you will standing behind five Giants on this near side of the bottom of your screen and that's where the onside kick go for the Giants will get the football like their good feel the New England Patriots have already wrapped up homefield advantage throughout the AFC playoff Indianapolis got boat race today down in Dallas which basically means that the Denver Broncos who play in Cincinnati tomorrow night the party clinched a playoff spot we've already clinched their division there we have to win one of their final two to make sure they are the other are the number two seed in the AFC do you simp eight Manning tomorrow night in Cincinnati and take your chances of whatever happens there give him another week to fully recover and then started in the season finale against Oakland with a chance to go ahead and nail down the number two seed or do you play in the barn that's a great question and you know who I would love to get the answer from is Peyton Manning because I'll tell you what being allowed Eli Manning and being around this family they're competitive yeah they wanna play in every single game I mean just look at the amount of consecutive starts at Eli has 166 yep Peyton's over 200 unfortunately arch only had 54 because of this time in New Orleans but I just think the way that Peyton Manning is the type of football player that he is he doesn't take Sundays off season if he has opportunity and makes his choice his plan this is John Fox is gone whether or not he is not there is going to be an extremely interesting decision for John Fox looking at that game tomorrow as you know you're playing football in the city of January really Denver Broncos when you talk about rare having a running back wash for over 100 and a pair of receivers with over a hundred last time the Giants had one of those got to go all the way back to October to 25th 2010 in big beans very impressive and I think the one that stands out the most for me it's Rueben Randle just think about if you didn't have the problems that he's had the last couple weeks with coach Coffey from being in the doghouse I know what type of player that live in Randall is I know what he's capable of but you cannot be late to meetings you can't do any of that stuff because it's not fair not only to you to yourself but to the rescue team so publicly do you think guys are looking at you thinking that they can trust you on the football field at key moments a few times I don't think time I plugged by the Giants all right basically here's the long and short of it all the spots in the NFC playoffs except for determining that final position is NFC South champion are determined the Seahawks are in with a Dallas win and they are in the playoff it's a matter now of the Lions against the Packers as champions of the NFC North they play next week Seattle and Arizona will play tonight and we can go to next week to determine a champion there and all money on the table Carolina Atlanta winnertakeall loser goes home you can laugh and stuff at the NFC South but one of those teams about the Seattle Seahawks of 2010 got in at 79 and cents at home and they completely changed the feeling and the mentality of that franchise and from that point forward they've completely turn that thing around and it becomes a championship football team the Gator here by Leuven Randall puts a Giants down of a 15yard line gain of 31 I'll tell you the Giants are not taking their foot off the throttle they are still slinging it around here with a tenpoint lead and closing in on three minutes to go over 500 yards of offense for the Giants against this Greg Williams defense who came in ranked 11th overall the Rams have not had a topten line defense going back to 2001 one of the unbelievable statistics that I think about it is this is ten straight seasons of over 3,000 yards for Eli Manning which is number four in NFL history behind few degrees who has 11 hit man who has 13 and the good old Brett Favre cuts it back to the inside skin up and dropped at the 12 by Robert Quinn and the Rams are gonna spend a timeout and the twominute warning coming up in 12 seconds from now it was interesting yesterday coffee to Jason pierrepaul he says you know it looks like we're rebuilding looking ahead to next year I found that a somewhat curious word choice and that word has been used in the written press a great deal lately about this Giants team you know when you think about having Beckham Eli Manning Williams maybe Jennings back a healthy Victor Cruz an improved Larry Jenelle perhaps you want to alter your offensive line a little bit I don't know if that's a makeup of a rebuilding team or not I don't think that it is I think that this season is has definitely brought this team and this group closer together the way that they've been eatin the handle adversity fight together but the strides that they've football team especially on the off it is sixteen weeks into a brandnew offense in the first NFL season would have been McAdoo as their offensive coordinator each and every week we've just seen the gradual improvement Brannen the record is not the record that they want this is in what they were hoping for this season they felt that they were a playoff gabbar team unfortunately they didn't come up with it but you've got a lot to look for in the future you talked earlier about Eli Manning he's gone up in completion percentage he's gone over and passing yard percentage and this is the most important thing I think the fact that he's owned is 113 interceptions compared the 27 last season is everything what field of law by Derrick Bates and it will hair and picked it up so two minutes to go TenPoint gave us maybe not over quite yet look at me that way logging the center merci Samantha lettuce isn't wouldn't you say mr. Dean Daren Bates just completely importance act yes hang on snapper but even more impressive is how quickly the second junkie snap over the handles looks like there guys still down there wrestling for the football and the Giants have recovered a signal has already been given if that's caring win that's a sack a fumble recovery and interception in just his third NFL game and it is Kerry Wayne who comes up with the nice pass rush on the outside is able to rip through fight just continue to effort just effort by his part and he's had an unbelievable game today well backtoback games I mean you know this is a guy that done you know only weighs 264 pounds and and that's not very big for defensive lineman he's out of Richmond which is a a powerhouse division champ program but nobody drafted this guy and because of all the injuries they've had up and down that defensive line he's getting a chance over this final month of the season man when you get that shot he's taken advantage of opportunities are never lost someone will take the one that you miss and he's taken full advantage of the opportunity given to him he has played sound football he's really stepped up and then this third career game as a player he's been completely just nonstop to me I mean just just think about how much effort that he's played with today and his ability to just make big pledging the indigent try that more game to be produced well week 16 continues later tonight on NBC then tomorrow we talked about the game in Cincinnati our game today produced by Bob standard directed by Craig scope and Tony my technical producer is 5 follows our refrain producer mark tightly associate director Yvonne Wagoner vodcast associate mr.

  "transcript": "welcome back to st. Louis moments away from kickoff let's check in downstairs the Laura open this week the physicality of a Greg Williams defense and how important mental discipline is gonna be today eli manning preparing is working receiver for this all week telling Odell Beckham jr. they're gonna try to get in your head don't let them back I'm telling me that stuff doesn't bother me I know I can't get penalties today but I also know sometimes you gotta get your point across Tom well all eyes will certainly be on this incredible rookie Odell Beckham jr. who lists the first four games of this season with a hamstring injury going all the way back to the preseason all he's done is hauled in 71 passes from his buddy Eli Manning and closing in on 1000 Jones just imagine Thomas he played the first four games of this what his numbers in production would have been this you did Rams won the toss chose team to phlearn to get the football in the second half so coming out to begin describe the opener of the game quarterback Eli Manning has never lost to the Rams of st. Louis today makes his 166 consecutive regular season started quarterback into Giants the longest active streak in the lake by any player in any position and the third longest by a quarterback beyond the history of the National Football League no Rashad Jennings today so the rookie Andre Williams will carry the bulbs of the workload today and that's a gain of three on first down and certainly we'll be watching against his bog to defense apply the Giants offensive line everybody understands how important Odell Beckham jr. announcer and Williams are going to be today but the front five with the Giants offensive the great khali communicating and being on the same page because this defensive corner every blitz imaginable down away quickly that's a good start for Manning and the giant catch made by the tie then Larry Danelle and that is a first down up to the 34 yard line Rams have gone 12 consecutive quarters without allowing a touchdown and James Laurinaitis is the key to everything he is the one who runs the show it's going to be important that he communicates to the back end after he gets a priest at diagnosis of what he thinks ilan men on this offense is going to do thank God that hands alarms way Williams about a very hard time running the football after Williams had the monster game today remember down to Tennessee where he carried 24 times for a hundred and thirtyone yards including a 50 yard touchdown but he did next to nothing after Jennings had to lead the game last week to get to Redskins we injuring the ankle you know those two Jennings and Williams have been almost the thunder and lightning in your toilet depends it's going to be important then gets in jokes after contact and that is going up to get it in traffic Randall down at the 18yard line last week was a second time in the last three games he was benched in the first quarter and now a big play in the first quarter today starting off there do a nice job of setting up the playaction they get the Rams defense to step up really be able to stretch that ball and hit Rueben Randle down the field who's playing this week in the first quarter and then the past weeks he's been set out Tom Coughlin hasn't wavered from being late for two years and other fans Eli Manning told us yesterday and I beat it with him that he really likes going nohuddle although after starting the game no huddle their dad in a red zone and now will are being a former offensive lineman who played with Eli Manning out on the football field played at the line of scrimmage you going nohuddle is what allows him to just think and instead of reactive Elias footwide taking it on the back field is Beckham jr. and I didn't fool anybody it went nowhere fast I can honestly say that's the first time I've ever seen a feel I'm Manning out there in that position that's for sure probably the first time he's ever been out there and I don't think wants to go back anytime soon I don't think we were either I don't think we'll see him out there I don't think the Rams defense were scared about his speed and his threat downfield eleventh season as head coach of the Giants where he's continued the talk shows will be be back for eight look at the onehanded grab my Beckham jr. he is denying first down yardage what a catch this is it might not be a first down it might not be a touchdown but one catch this is by Beckham they've got Rueben Randle back them out there and they look like they were gonna run a little rubber out get him out to the sidelines but what a catch my boots help back on junior he just continues to show why he is an elite receiver in the NFL it's one thing to go up and get it in the end zone we've seen some of those some during the pregame warmup that one right there in traffic 29 yard field goal try by Josh Brown the onetime read that it is good so on the opening drive the Giants had the drive stove inside the 15 but they come away with three thanks in large part to the grabbed by Rueben Randle today's game is sponsored by Southwest Airlines booked you over there now at southwest.com 3nothing and giant Eli Manning perfect on the opening drive three of 368 yards and so now we'll get a look at the st. Louis Rams on offense Benny Cunningham to the yards out of his own end zone spun down the ball is loose still loose and it looks like the Giants haven't it looked like that bird hey the rook you had the football at the bottom of the pile but we wait for them to pull everybody off up and their st. Giants football big momentum play changing play right there on special teams to get a turnover get the ball into the red zone right away to start the second possession that is exactly what the Giants needed to do here on the road start fast and create those turnovers early remind where leads dark level they just picked up two weeks ago forced the fumble of Cunningham and indeed it was a rookie Beret who recovered it normally it's the lands that are the fast starters in games this year among the very best in that category in the NFL but now it's the Giants who applied to head to a three nothing lead football at one fastball right by the Manning you're gonna see dark will come in and get a nice hit on Cunningham this is exactly what Tom Coughlin said he said he needed the special teams to step up and play fast in this game and create these turnovers because they feel that is the only way that they're going to be able to stay ahead of the chains here in st. Louis against these defense 86 10yard line that'll be a gain of course don't wanna bring a third down this your Giants offensive line has been playing much better here in these last couple of games consistent guys up front they haven't had to change the lineup and I know speaking to coach flirty the offensive line coach it's clearly made a difference in the production on this awkward and it sparked about the 17 so it was third at six to the jungle stomach Giants do well to pick it up made by Preston Parker and he will lean inside the tent there is a penalty flag two of them holding number 65 that's will be T locked up with Robert Quinn certainly worth watching that matchup here today there most certainly will lead because Robert Quinn on that one showed this explosiveness went for the rip roof right around William BT where he beated was clearly grasping around his feet got beat right at the point easy penalty to throw were checked into the backfield practice law down at 16 the money to Ruhlman Randall and depends on his spot they needed to give to the 11 yard line for a first down and it's right bear on it Rueben Randle is gonna run the curl is able to get it to the sticks and come back right against Tremaine Johnson who is a very good cornerback for this team this is a nice start for the Giants offense mixing in the runs getting the playoffs you go but the most important thing that there punch it in right now because this defense of the city's Ranch as the best in the redzone 31 possessions for offenses down there but only 14 touchdowns they say I was getting all four twenties Becca and a very short game over the concept after he was out of bounds now that a lot to do with our conversation with many of these Giants yesterday that st. Louis's defense plays right on the edge I know for myself personally when I was in New York giant playing up against Greg Williams defenses he was in New Orleans in Washington as an offensive lineman he always said go eat with running backs and wide receivers on the pile because they're gonna get try to hit as many times to get as many stuff as it can go down Beckham jr. in the back getting in zone a touchdown penalty flag is thrown for that command extent it would be his tenth touchdown of this season remember he missed the first four games after the touchdown taunting number 13 New York is good it would be a force on the kickoff naturally Tom Coughlin saying hey come on down you know he's proven himself out on a football field he just scored a touchdown that's the last thing any there's a little looks like a miscommunication between Tremayne Johnson and TJ McDonald on the back end that's an easy toss and catch right there for Eli Manning and Odell Beckham jr. to get a very important touchdown here early the great this red zone at 12 twelve disorders without giving up the touch he is his time has beckham Jeremy Shockey zwooky record for reception to the Year by a giant and a record tyer and touchdown prevention is st. Louis Rams defense under Greg Williams had not allowed a touchdown spanning 12 consecutive quarters that is a fourth longest streak in the NFL going back to the 2000 year but after the turnover by Cunningham on the kickoff return they'll give it another try and he's up to the 37 yard line so we finally get a look at the lamps offense until we are nearly midway through this opening quarter the flag comes in a lot of talking a lot of pushing a lot of shoving even to kick her Brown getting involved that's the last place you want to be as a kicker jumping on the pile or in the middle of the scrum like that kick the ball make sure you get to the sidelines personal foul unnecessary roughness number three of the king they're gonna get him for jumping on the pile take a guy right to face battle generally get your blood we'll cruise in along the mighty Mississippi the Gateway to the West st. Louis Missouri 10 nothing Giants over the whole team throws it behind Stedman say we've got a nice catch by the second year wide out of West Virginia this is where they get Josh Brown with the old mule kick here giving them the kick to the face to clear penalty and coach Coughlin obviously is disappointed with him doing that believe me when you have those penalties coach Coughlin is not scared to confront you about them all right first play from scrimmage for this Rams offense is a gain of five and on uh cadaver looking trade basic news come on strong is this season is moving forward he has his second most rushing yards behind the Bengals Jeremy hill among all wookies in the National Football League Sean Hill now 34 years old out of Parsons Kansas came into a league as an undrafted rookie free agent of Minnesota stops along the way with the 49ers in Detroit signed with the Rams his soft season came in as a backup to Sam Bradford he was hurt as you may remember in the preseason he'll started the first game injured his quad and just got his job back five weeks ago three and finds a starter this year say bye lost so it's inside the 30 twentynine there are games that have been going on already today with incredible playoff implications the Panthers won they're now in first in the south New Orleans eliminated in the NFC South it'll come down to the Panthers against the Falcons next weekend for the division title Green Bay is clinched a playoff spot twice already placed a playoff spot they will play next weekend for divisional title a firstround Bob still lays it off the Harkey it is chopped down at the 28yard one big one later tonight of course out in the NFC West Seattle in Arizona but right now we look at the Rams on offense Tavon Austin is a home run hitter he has the ability whether it's on reverse is whether he lines up in the eye he's at the slot he has been able to open up this offense from Schottenheimer and the rest of this boot and he is a threat because you've got to pay attention to where he is on the field wrapped up at set by Jason pierrepaul my oh my as he come on strong here of late seven sack in the last threeplus game they're gonna run a basic tackle and twist jenkins is able to split it through and get the penetration JTP comes around that's his seventh sack in the last three and he has two forced fumbles as well he's really been putting on a pass rushing clinic as of late because we never know this may be the last time to see him in the New York Giants uniform yup he is a free agent along with Antrel Rolle at the end of the year so we 851 field mode dry for survive yes 2008 one of the strongest legs in a leave they take advantage of the penalty by Brown to cap it off on a pill goal David brought up earlier Tom Coughlin's preaches all the time about penalties silly penalties you take in the taunting penalty on the touchdown by Odell Beckham jr. there's 15 before you kick it off then when you do kick it off 15yard penalty on the tip / Brown 30 yards 80 that field goal drive for the land Weston partner brings it up to the 25yard line and the back on offense come Eli and the Giants here's a Pepsi flag wait a minute out empty flag down on a play we did not see it along the sideline Jeff Fisher wondering what this is all about the Pirelli our referee today outside number 53 of the ectopy the fiveyard penalty be added to the end of the run first down time out so they'll start to drive at the 30 the youngster penned maca new offensive coordinator the Giants up against the wall Ragan Williams was not carried on odds with he's up to the 35 first enemies Jeremy Shockey most of the season receptions in a season and then after the talking this head coach reminds him that's not the world town at all we're looking for let's catch and he will be in the Giants record holding for a looki in a single season we need ice catch right David wait Daniel fells and that's the first down up to the 47 yard line nice job by Daniel fells recognizing that they brought the Blitz he gets to his hop he's able to catch that 150 yards after catch moves the chains here for this offense this is to start that Eli Manning and Ben McAdoo said that they needed during this football game and had the nice families between the run in the past and when they do bring the Blitz we've got to make sure that we release six rushing attack we're going to Joe he wants a fight 400 yards in the touchdown and not much there CJ McDonald comes up to the strong safety spot well ring in the New Year on Fox Sports 1 will bring a marathon a big E's basketball all ten teams backtoback including a showdown between number 23 Cutler and seventh ranked Villanova the marathon begins New Year's Eve 11:30 a.m. Eastern team goes all the way to midnight only on foxsports1 if quiet starts to this way of defensive front until now they bring the safety TJ McDonald in ABS the first sack of Manning today andre williams has him on this protection but TJ mcdonnell does a nice job of getting the inside signal andre williams you've got to use your hands you have got a punch in them you've got to stop them you cannot go in with too expect to come up with the key block on that type of blitz backed up third and four you need to get to the ramps 43 for a first let's cover it again dottie Danelle and he is shot down there is a penalty flag down lighted midfield games able to break down two daily that's going to be taken back I think Preston Parker was blocking before pass interference number 83 fourth down so for the first time today the Rams defense force is a fun you know we talked about the 12 quarters they had gone before allowing a touchdown there at mine that touchdown was only the second allowed in the first quarter all year long by this Rams defense the only other touchdown as a team they surrendered was on a punt return and that was created off of the turnover on the kickoff return for the Rams you put the ball in that position but anything fence is going to have a tough time switching back to and adapting I stood inside the tent and looked out for Austin down the sideline penalty flag and he brings em let's see when they spotted to the 48 yard line to somebody his size he shows toughness he shows confidence he fights right through three missed blocks on this one but his ability to just continue to see one hole and hit it that is the thing that you have to be as a returner you've got to be fearless and you have got to be decisive you've once you see that hole you've got to hit it fast because it closes in a splitsecond markers like able to run him out of bounds after a 41 yard return now first down for the Rams the opponent's shoving is where they spotted big hole for Mason and he's tripped up in the 37 yard line Cory hearty leading the way for Trey Mason really nice job of running the counter you're gonna see Harkey go in motion but he does a great job of coming back setting up that block on mcclain Trey Mason just taken the box in him right off of it and moving for Trey Mason has been unbelievable in the last six games five of them he's at over a hundred yards and he has really been that explosive and recharge that they've needed on this he began the years of backup Zac Stacy of the big years it was he last year in the air it's intercepted by carry wins kangan cinnamon made by Austin tipped into the air in the rookie out of Richmond is getting a lot of playing time his johnnyonthespot his first career int anytime you throw these wide receiver screens you've got to make sure that you throw it low and you do not throw it high for this reason right here anytime it is thrown high and you get that tip you are definitely susceptible to any type of interception that's just a tip throw and it's crazy that if a defensive lineman carry win is the one that got involved in it when usually it's the defensive backs of the practice that week in and week out winners coming off the excellent game he had a teamhigh 17 hits Washington good things to say about you the entire year the last three weeks first town carry by Williams and that will be a gain of close to six yards light at midfield Preston Parker coming in on that one making a good block and that is the one thing about Preston Parker he is not scared to get his hands dirty do the blocking you know they motioned him in and he'll hit on the edges against defensive ends you know you got to give this man a lot of credit for doing this as a free agent he was a guy that was out of football and was doing a lot of odd jobs we have an injured player it looks like EJ Gaines down on a Dean looky out of Missouri he grew up he's down the load in Independence Missouri EJ gains building looked out on the lamp sidelines he is the only looking quarterback to start every game for his team in the NFL this year romaine Johnson will replace him to early turnovers for st. Louis EJ Gaines has been on 97% of the defensive snaps and his ability to step inside at the mecca for this team second down there we see bodies fly even the lion act the first sound of the whistle that was Chris long who came flying in there it's gone back for now his third straight weeks he was injured in the season opener he is a longest tenured lamb and of course the Sun tomorrow but savvy law that'll be the final play of the opening point ten three Giants Fox NFL Sunday we'll continue in a moment to begin a second quarter it is a 30 for the juggler lady 23 so now down the sideline beautifully thrown ball and excellent know they're saying he did not hang on to the football through the process once he came down did not maintain control very nice play design they tried doing the picked and rough everybody took their attention to Odell Beckham jr. which it was allowed Larry down with the getdown in the field looks like a catch to me boy it sure does especially after he had big touched and this is a challenge flag thrown by Tom Kaufman it looked like he had already been touched down with possession of the football and a big pat on the back Coughlin to Danelle New York is challenging the previous play that the receiver made a catch by now so the judiciary will have a look Pete Morelli how about it after reviewing the play the receiver did maintain control of the ball and was down by contact the ball he plays for the place we're saying down by contact after he had controlled the ball and it was only after contact was made balls ripped out of there by over 23 yard gain on the reception by Danelle the former college quarterback at Granite State go you are stuck sir they attach like he just made and now couldn't handle that one Mike Pereira back in Los Angeles always a part of our telecast here on Fox you're not surprised by that decision are you Michael no a few people were on Twitter because they say it's the process of the catch but the process ended when he was sliding on the ground with complete control and then the defender in the second act pulled the ball away down by contact today they come up today we always like Chucky to the mic program fella fishing well there's a record setter right there by Odell Beckham jr. Gibson stands there is a bowling flag so second up so take away the record for the tie beam William BT gets his hands outside again the framework and just throws down Robert Quinn so let's back to two holding penalties now against William Beebe you see those hands outside just grabs him outside and pulls him down it's one thing if you put your hands on his back and push them but the minute they see that jerk that pull we're gonna hit me with it every time Chinese children only steel suck a damn Trustin markets by LaMarcus enjoyed and Parker talked about some of the playoff scenarios in the NFC the Steelers were their win today have clinched a playoff spot they will play the Bengals next kid potentially the NFC North in a firstround bye on the line potentially defending the Bengals have to play Denver tomorrow night Denver would happen New England today when it's wind takes care of home field advantage in the AFC playoff Rosa Bullock again to partner but he's short appears to be sort of the first down let's chuck it downstairs an injury update with Laura Oh DJ games you guys talked about it there hasn't been many of those one of the things the coaches love best about this work he is his durability but right now he's in the locker room they're undergoing tests for his shoulder his return is questionable thank you very much this will be a 37yard field goal tribe for Josh Brown he is just just won the entire year for the Giants diets lead is 10 after the take away total domination as far as the numbers are concerned but it is just a 10point game Giants in front 13 to 3 well 29 to play until halftime put so forth taking me folkpop one today notice learned good the strip of black along the shoulder area of his jacket which of course will be worn by police departments men and women all over the United States after the tragic story horror if extort about to New York policemen killed in their car yesterday ambushed in just a cowardly act and our thoughts and prayers are certainly with there are many many friends and family and so many others terrible school Kenny let's check in back in Los Angeles game break time hello Joel black Tom hello and we go to Dallas where it's been a quick morning so far for Dez Bryant that's a touchdown from Tony Romo more like the afternoon 19 yards Colts failed a fake punt inside their own territory that's why I said it all so quickly 40 nothing Tom sack Stacy gets a two and he's met by Jonathon Mankins Hankins is having a really good year second round draft choice out of Ohio State has gotten better and better as this season has gone on and they're very excited about Hankins moving forward he had big shoes to fill with lint ball Joseph when he left after last now if you look at the Giants draft picks ago from past its started with Barry Cole field second round or Linville Joseph's second rounder and now Jonathan hankins stepping in his seven sacks Stacy and he's up to close to the 45 bring up third down and we love the work of the men and women in uniform serving around the world watching today's game in 175 countries and aboard ships at sea on AFN it forces Network thank you for all you do god bless you all the way from your families and friends standing strong and proud for the greatest country in the world the United States of America by taunting my god in his contact with no flag Brett was looking for a flag contact was sacked Bowman in the secondary it like Jamil MacLean flank through a tender knee was able to get me to Sean Hill forcing the errant throw jpp was getting pressure around the edge forced Sean Hill to step up in that pocket took a big hit right there by McClain and that's the defense and those are the technical blitzing schemes that this Giants defense and pure fuel have dialed up these past couple weeks now one quick that Johnny huh boys suck Bobo alas happy holidays in early merry Christmas to all 16 of the NFL season after taking that shot a moment ago that Sean Hill the landside 130 three jugs drive starts with twenty cannot drain Williams for maybe two talking about pairing fuel and this defense stepping up there's the big hit right there by Camille McLain get it right in the rib cage jpp pounded on as well between an afterparty timeout check again donut bye boys if not a bad run up to the 27 where brings up third down a three now 511 230 pounds out of Costas common his lower body leg strength his ability to just continue to push piles and keep those legs driving get those yards after contact it then it's not on a break with here they've seen size in years to come when triggered trusted microphones down across the 40 up to the 42 yard line Parker does a nice job of spinning inside getting those yards after catch continuing to move the chains like I said he is the guy that I've been very impressed with and every single coach that we've talked he said he is just a fighter in a competitive place had you learned your lesson he was out of football couple of decent years with Tampa Bay these giants brought a bit as a free agent this year forty receptions start for his first cannon run to the deck but not before a gain of seven baby eight by Ogletree that's funny some of the guys should bring in over the course of the year and the Giants have placed 22 players on seasonending injury reserve so they brought in a lot of guys as they say off the street then they'll certainly happen I've talked to Ronnie Boggs the head trainer where I've been york times has been there for swarmin law standing up dark was short of a first day very good start today free wife Antibes offensive lines done a good job they really have it really at the point of attack in the run game have done a good job the solidified before going up to the second level linebackers and they really have done a nice job of protecting from you our Manning give him the amount of time that he needs deliver the ball Giants very good on third and one this year 15 out of 20 16 times naked 17 and in cash it again tied knots key in front of Williams to convert on third a on very nice play designed by Ben McAdoo the offensive coordinator puts in motion Adrian Robinson to the other side we see the st. Louis Rams defense kind of slide over and they hit it to the backside so very nice design on that to get the first down much was made of McAdoo they had the terrible preseason you may remember terrible preseason on offense they lost their first two games in regonition team score Game five what but most people most critical the Giants like the Giants in his first year the mcadoo have made progress there's a very funny new series coming the Box in January called back strong stars Rainn Wilson is a brilliant but except to accomplish all the toughest cries series premieres Thursday January 22nd on fire I don't they're certainly the growing pains work this off girls brain is just about marketing but Eli Manning's numbers are much better than a year ago perfect weather moves in a randall inside 230 and that'll move the change puts down giant going oneonone against Tremaine Johnson this runs a flag gets the better of them Tremont's and his aim is enabled to get his head around the hook came to find the football that's an easy throw for Iman man Eli's off to that according to the thirty nine hundred eighty five yards and a touchdown a selector pregnant for Odell Beckham jr. Freitas on the back there or else our yessiree TJ McDonnell he was the one that come you may remember was flagged for taunting on the touchdown in the first quarter after play was over punting and the 25 defense after this to go on my personality and TJ McDonald ran out of Bounce and out of its way did that little extra talk and that little extra intimidation at his face you just can't have that in the game that you're already down not to mention what do you want over to talk trash about I just got a first down in a nice couch you watch it every week and it does make you wonder what could he have possibly been thinking about but only he can answer that 15 yards we'll leave it down to the 12 yard line and a timeout going to be called by the Giants and they're still talking down here that coming McDonald buckins been lighten it up as we know even doing this the first four games and he is something to watch more people out here watching his pregame warmup and taking pictures you know putting stuff up on Instagram to show and show that video footage in know when we've had the Giants this year and we've gone around you know you think about the time here in st. Louis you know people would come to watch Mark McGwire hit beat in and hit dinners and it's no different right now for Odell Beckham jr. they just want to see the amazing one hand two catches before the game four yards shy of a thousand on the year got his 10th touchdown of the year today again he missed his first four games his season without hands so now the Giants alltime for receptions the CB yards and touchdown question templayer dry they give it to Garko and he will find the endzone touchdown first time in the career of four leagues dark wood rookie out of too late then they signed a little more than a month ago how about that were extrude two arm tackles the last one to get his hands on there which is surprising he was able to get to Erin Donald just keep those legs driving he was able to find the seam and just run right through it first one was Michael Hayes second one was Erin Donald he's able to continue to run through and cut that back get a nice touchdown Darko an undrafted rookie signed originally by Miami they put him on the practice squad now this is his fifth date with the Giants since being activated congratulations to him and the Giants are rollin here at st. Louis so far dark will the rookie is first career touchdown 12yard one took a hit stayed on his feet and all the sudden his ranch defense which had pitched backtoback shutouts and wins over Oakland and Washington they gave up four field goals last week in the walls to Arizona and the Giants have come in here and put 20 on them was still five minutes to go in the first by Tim Barnes they what David you and I were just talking about next weekend in the NSC it looks like there will be a couple of games with huge either playoff or home field F implications you know Green Bay and Detroit still have to figure out who's gonna win the NFC North it's going to come down to Carolina and Atlanta to who's going to win the NFC South and there are more than half a dozen teams still alive for a playoff spot in the AFC and that is why you absolutely love the NFL in December because we're really not going to know what's going to happen within these next two weeks the most important thing that any team can do is win your football games you cannot be worried about well if this situation occurs what we need this team to lose you can't think about the way take advantage and handle this into yourself and get in the playoffs that way take one team today really two teams it stand out that make you wonder how did it comment to this would be the Saints who lose a officially being eliminate I said a scrambling around on second down raise it up down the sidewalk can you believe that looked like he was trying to throw it away in Kenny Britt comes racing out of nowhere Merson officials are still talking about whether the catch will stand and now they say it is a reception under pressure you soon keeps his eyes downfield who needs the it's a strong partner 27yard partly the champion she just say to yourself how did it happen today Saints lose again at home and they really got kicked around in that game by Atlanta were it not for a kickoff return of 99 yards they were dominated today in New Orleans and the other one the Baltimore Ravens they go on the road and just get sloppy the Sun by the Houston Texans KC Keene of the quarterback today that was a team that we thought all they run this year the Baltimore Ravens not really thought that there could both the cows and make a splash but in that division and and the way that this season has gone made really actually struggled down the stretch and haven't gotten the wins that that they needed them should have won and you couldn't be more right about the New Orleans Saints they used to be dominant at home drew Brees strong for almost 300 yards each and every one of those games but there has been zero consistency in a defenceman border and really breeze has not had a nice time here especially a big bonus this season back in the fourth quarter two days close it up naina Sania flag intercepted Rogers Cromartie still on his feet tackled in 231 when a flag all the way down contact miss mavens rogers Cromartie okay bye Ashton half Center parents undertow matted down big play light here for the land very big play Dominic Rogers Cromartie has been playing lights out these last couple of weeks that when you see them just make the clear contact downfield on Austin gets the penalty and it takes away that interception which could have been another crucial momentum changing play for this it's a ransom fighting chance to get back then that's a 26yard penalty on these issues encroachment defense fiveyard penalty you know you close down really nice job with the cadence and snap count given to her accountant but Shawn Jo to defend comes to job loss sides where's Janet five Mason sniffing yet Zoe flag down no signal give it on a touchdown we wait on the penalty as finally it is sickle a touchdown for Mason they got a nice blocked out there by the wide receiver Kenny of the 26 feet that touchdown is good the penalty of being forced for the kickoff right there against at the ground we see Kenny Britt just physically dominating him and getting that extra push and that block for Trey Mason to get that touchdown natural roll trying to come over to make the tackle clearly grabs the facemask and gets the penalty I never will love penalize the Giants on the kickoff so that makes it a 10point game tonight Odell Beckham jr. ride enjoy some of the great names for New York rookie to the Year boy who is ever better than that guy the great Tom terrific and a giant slaughters better than that guy Patrick Ewing hard to believe that is almost 30 years ago and of course just retired this year after such a glorious career with the Yankees Derek Jeter how about that company Sieber Taylor you wait cheater not bad you know when you think about it a lot of Giants fans and a lot of people that have watched the Muir Giants for a long time have compared Odell Beckham jr. zz impact as a rookie on the offense just like Lawrence Taylor when he was a defensive end slash outside linebacker hybrid who completely changed the game of football with the way he played to get that comparison to that guy talk about very impressive when you look at all those guys and what three of the four eventually won a title in the Big Apple we know about Taylor yep Jeter multiple ranks there and of course Tom terrific going all the way back to the Varick events in 1969 the only one who did not win a championship there after so many great season Patrick Ewing so after the penalty man's gonna kick off for the 15th this is where you see that short kickoff where they would force a guy to try and won it out ideally what we've seen lately is we'll kick that ball right at the oneyard line forcing them to return it didn't happen there have you heard about the new show empire coming in January Terrence Howard as a hip hop mogul and his just out of prison exwife hi drop amazing music the show for you Empire play nears Wednesday January 7th on five we talked about that a moment ago couple of touchdowns surrendered by this Rams defense after not giving over the last 12 points coming into the game to a team to go the Giants have two timeouts remaining Beckham got a block got a couple up and this may be a flag and then a kid 5 Beckham say and his games got a chance to get ugly it might get ugly right now it is getting ugly right now you can see this coming from a long time ago we've had a kicker kicked somebody in the face we've had a couple of late hits out of bounds that one a very late hit out of bounds by Alec Ogletree and Odell Beckham jr. didn't like you know where he was going to get off to the blind now go Alex Ogletree actually pushed him and pushed in the helmet and then the facemask and that's where we saw the retaliation out of Odell Beckham jr. but we've got to get back to football here it's a much fight and all this stuff that's going on yeah it's gonna bring some intensity to this football game but let's do it inside the lines let's do it out on the football field the let's play a competitive game I gotta tell you David deals you know you brought it up earlier as clearly that that's just a late hit a late shot and then a push a kick the cannula opened was able our Saipan Yahoo was able to get out of the way of that one who shoes right there get out of the way Laura find safety somewhere down there you know you brought it up earlier and you're a guy to played the live allpro offensive line but you know what even further makes you wonder you're talking about a couple of teams that are going nowhere so why are you jaw what have you done to jaw and then and that's that's the most disappointing thing I believe me tempers get going and emotions get flying but this is doing nothing to benefit either one of your football teams right now not to mention with all this stuff that happens on the sidelines with all the people involved this is when people really get hurt in those big scrubs and piles and David puts the other guys in a tough spot that aren't initially involved in whatever's going on because you do have to feel like I would imagine don't you gotta defend your teammates if something's going on believe me as an offensive lineman for playing in the NFL for 11 years you are a bodyguard you're there to protect your guys you're there to make sure that nobody gets cheapshotted and when it comes time like that yeah you're written there defending and you're pulling guys apart because you want to protect your guys well we're still waiting for Pete Morelli and company the Rams are the most penalized team in the NFL and they have that reputation not a single referee right now if you're looking except for the one that was just picked up and now the other one that's picked up every single flag is out on the field right now we started very early the talking perhaps a little fuel to the fire when Beckham spins the ball in the face of McDonald the taunting penalty after the touchdown in the end zone and it is escalated from there Tom Coughlin's said it yesterday you knew that this could be a game that gets chippy like this but he said you have to control yourself under the pressure and you've got it make sure that you've got to walk away from those things and do it when the ball is snapped that's when you can get it done and that's where you see really this year the difference between these two teams among many is it Jeff Fischer's teams the most penalized team in a league Tom Coughlin's team among the least penalized teams in the league Mike Pereira you know you've been down on the field for a long time before you got moved up to the head of NFL officials when you're down there on the field right now what is going on in that meeting with nearly every official involved in it well the one thing they're trying to decide here is who are they going to eject I mean I think that you're gonna have offsetting personal fouls I'm sure certainly Ogletree starts the whole thing with the late shove down and then the second shove but you get a puncher to that's throwing yep absence where there's multiple fouls on the play and some ejections ejected from the game will be number 83 for the New York Giants and then the 95 for me and number 95 for st. Louis and 98 and New York Giants there was a foul against an official on this play we will go 15 yards against a st. Louis and then bring the flag back and make it first in 25 at 52 personal foul on defense all right so we have had two montre for Preston Parker ours Preston Parker are the Giants and then we have William Hayes backup defensive end for the Rams up Mike please finish your thought there but while they try to figure out where the ball is gonna be 83 was the one that we thought would be ejected the other thing is now is when you do that in his crew and say this has to stop and I have seen games shut down where referees certainly what I would do in the situation at feet is doing right now I'm sure he's telling Tom Coughlin and he'll tell Jeff Fischer the same thing we got this game under control and if somebody even breathes on an opponent we're going to call fouls until we get it under control and that's about the only way you can get a game like this back under control and get it in him what he saw as Mike Pereira mentioned Preston Parker got wrapped up in the whole sort of pile getting pushed and shoved and then he decided to throw a right hook at somebody de montreuil Moore who wasn't even on the field gets involved over on the sidelines he's been thrown out and as we mentioned William Hayes also ejected this is uglier than why tonight listen I will say this it's probably not the last of it either because the league will go over all of this film and they are really really strict when it comes to fighting so even players that weren't called for fouls or disqualified might end up with those fine letters next week the league does not like this scene period and they will aggressive I assure you all right Mike Pereira thank you very much we are trying to find out if deep Morelli's microphone went out when announcing a third giant being ejected in this game I'm sure Tom Coughlin's as Mike Pereira just mentioned is wanting to know okay once we sorted all that out where's the ball going to be as to modulate war this led back into the waffle question is did jonathan Hankins get thrown out of this game we told you about Parker and we told you about boy and those were the only two that we've seen walk off to the field together lock room with William Hayes so first ad board all the way back to the 13 yard line they get second out of it twominute warning at 157 so we are at the twominute warning boycrazy here in st. Louis and the 11 for the Giants get out is driven to the ground by oval trends and the Giants will find another two minutes to play until halftime when we check you downstairs right now part of the action the morale okay all right got my dad to know I am okay but in all actuality not surprising that all these scrums event Odell Beckham jr. in the middle of it the ranch defense has been talking about him all week while the media and the fans of New York loves the attention Odell has gotten defenses don't especially veteran defense s that's what they've been talking about this week about not only a success but the celebrations that come after with it yet so not a surprise at all that there's been a lot of scrub to go down the middle not a surprise at all when a young player comes along and they make some of the plays some of the highlights we've seen an idiot throw in some of the celebrations which a lot of guys still don't like some of the young fans might like if some of the veteran players don't like it at all and it is official Jonathan hankins was not ejected Parker more for the Giants A's for the way to the 24yard blah man still on his feet first yeah Derek things like a53 of the rains too late hit by xacti Asiata bounce right there and this'll tack on another 15 yards to a pretty good return when these coaches and these officials do indeed need to get this game back on track because this is not good and you run the risk of very very serious injury to players on both teams when you're hitting guys three and four and five and seven yards out of bounds Dale Shaw the back judge may pull aside by people we have two fouls after the play illegal block in the back number 31 the receiving team late hit out of bounds personal foul number 51 by one of the Giants I ruled those files will offset the ball be placed where the ball went out of bounds between we've had a lot to get to in this last five minutes of this game that's for sure while 54yard punt 17yard return and the wall of the park Giants have been penalized for a hundred and twenty four yards and real that is a seasonhigh name nice reception a like any Twitter and a fine lamps have two timeouts left in a minute 222 play good enough for a first down by cutting cane in the Giants territory to the 47yard one locket it used to one one minute to go Just In Time heavy pressure my colleague Jenkins Jenkins actually goes on Ebola he actually splits the center in the car right now stop wells and tabs and Joseph right through the middle of the office I mean that you can't have that miscommunication and just let Colin Jenkins run through Jenkins been around a long time originally a college free agent seven years of starter find a healthy again and this is something quite more hands in Chillicothe good protection catch at the 30yard line by Stedman Bailey 45 seconds and he'll try to get the line scrimmage down of all the time about 44 tips were made so while we have the mumps let's check in the Curt Menefee to see what's coming up on the visa halftime report coming up on the visa halftime we've got your highlights from a busy day so far as the Chargers movement in the sixth seed in the AFC with Ravens loss and over in the NFC the Panthers take over the South lead lead until when it take all game next week against the Falcons highlights it have well you and I have seen a lot David deal of that NFC South and look who's gonna kid who when everybody the division is well under five hundred it ain't been pretty but somebody's going to win it and it's right now down to the Falcons in the pan it's just amazing that the team who loses and doesn't take over the division is going to have a topten draft pick so either you're going up are you gonna get drafted well I don't think I've ever seen that you're right like wow first down save on Austin avoids a tackle tiptoes along the sideline steps out of bounds into 15 another first down clocks 37 seconds left this runs a basic crossing route right through the middle of let's read Austin antral will cannot keep up with that one as he's crossing gets the first doubt but the biggest thing he did is get out about to stop the clock Lancey dominated unconcerned about five minutes ago for the touchdown to get this to a 20point game in half let's coming Nach first to the game by their leading receiver the Titan Jared club five your game clock at 25 seconds and they still have a timeout left in the lanes will take a lot of time here now they'll be forced to call the time rip inside the five will make it first and goal and that is their final timeout nine seconds left this drive in this two minute drive they've done a very nice job with the crossing locks in tryptophan Tavon Austin with the first now Kevin Britt but you're correct Tom they did not do a good job of managing the clock and managing the time during this one when coming up on the visa halftime he saw there a moment ago Kurt Halle Michael Jimmy and company the Saints and the Dolphins eliminated from the playoffs today Packers and Steelers clinched playoff spots here you look at blind shot primer the Rams offensive coordinator so let's see what he decided to do with nine seconds left i snap that took a lot of time and it's that we barely open zone to their high snap and affected the timing of the routes with the quarterback they weren't on the same page you tried delivering that one late and just to not give them a good throat you know without that high snap and he'll have eaten too low right what David you figured maybe get two shots at it at the end zone at that play forces you now to kick a field goal and just think about how much time they've wasted in this twominute drive that they could have had another attempt to take a shot at the end zone and hopefully come up with the touchdown instead of right now seven 20 yard and it is good the lands will get the ball to start the second half well you'll certainly want to stick around for the second half of this one neither one of these teams are going to the playoffs but some might be going to the disciplinary head of the NF OH 22:13 just about set to begin the second half lamps will get the football nice on our performance it excites Eli Manning we talked a lot with him yesterday David deal about keeping him upright his offensive line has done an excellent job and he's gotten more ball out of his hand quickly they pin it on target yeah they've been able to run the quick route speed of this I stopped into the wide receivers just things going at the vet not rely solely on that's mentioned please now the Giants have not she sits on the season and when you're on the road in the second continue to follow the undisciplined play in the selfish place they're gonna catch up to you you're going to lose football game exactly what'll be interesting to see very early on in this second half if perhaps",

  "transcript": "the car and autotrader.com the SPF and shop.com powered by Dick's Sporting Goods real stories are coming out of there on a weekend 99 and fill our government spider can hear at LP Field is brought to you by DIRECTV the penalty brings the Steelers back inside us what he saw begins the second half hey I'm down off the good first half runs just shy of the 30yard line he's down at the 29 Titans did a nice job mixing it up in the first half expect that to continue here's just a threeman rush Roethlisberger has time to survey the defense surprised he did not see 3 archers streaking down the right sideline then they come with an allout 7 man rush Michael Griffin makes an impact after you don't know what it is until the ball snapped against this very horse defense with 77 yards total it's the first down just about at the 35 yard line just back on that punch earlier that was called back with the penalty was legit push in the back a little bit late in terms of getting past the run but there was also a facemask on Brown the return man that was not called steelers committed a couple fouls there one that got called puts them back but they've got the first down now at their own 35 penalty's been a story for the fillers third most penalized team per game in the NFL we won in Denver Roethlisberger incomplete trying to hit Marcus Wheaton around midfield again be near a local met a few Cod I'll recovered this bleeding ray Wilson had three passes broken up in the first half in the red zone he's all over Marcus Wheaton on this outside breaking Rock he is sitting on these Steeler receivers I'll be surprised if Todd Haley it is to see that try going after Wilson with a double move of some kind wilson head struggled to prepare and watch the t he has not had a good season here in his second year but coming up with a good game let's go here tonight 35 Roethlisberger throws to Antonio's round he'll pick up yet another first down their seventh connection to the lot of receivers run hook patterns but an Antonio Brown runs them from a close split and he gets his width and depth as he accelerates to the outside and it's hard on a cornerback when a receiver surges from a grouse split and Pittsburgh does a lot of that within Tonio Brown who has incredible stopandstart quickness picks round pick to merge the top receivers in the lead his on a quick one for rocket burger and just across midfield and he enjoyed it keep blitzing these inside linebackers pittsburgh has a running play called and Roethlisberger just aborted to handoff it's a double blitz by he's inside linebacker Roethlisberger knows he's got a dead run he barely got that off run games solutions you call a running play and if it's an overloaded situation the solution is pick it up in throat Antonio Brown to the left office burger and milk in trouble and he's pressed down supporting one yard terrific pursuit include Joy's Woodyard and Williamson all a heart said we're going to bless them and we're going to cheese rifle burgers booze we're gonna make them uncomfortable we're going to blitz everybody and they brought the inside linebackers 54 Williamson at 59 butchered all night if you don't go someplace with the ball flips on your back Guddi play collies by this Tennessee Titan Cochise Tampines players effect enough array Horton as we've said her today Dick LeBeau vote wrapped him but he was in Cincinnati more quick more precious just six alive Williamson again the rookie out of Kentucky thought Haley indeed to get to the maximum protecting for some quick Rose or Ben Roethlisberger won't finish this game it comes forming up the Flint both linebackers were going to run across dog in Williamson comes scotfree the jump later rookie out Kentucky making his presence felt backtoback sac when you mix it away Buster's backed up their catch at the 22yard locker been a tough night for Roethlisberger the interception in the red zone at the end of the half but the pressure they have not solved yet five sacks by the Tennessee Titans the to win Titans leading got boy well this franchise moved from Houston to Tennessee Steve McNair was the success to the quarterback position delayed back there 11 years over 21 got them to that Super Bowl they lost to the Rams but since then in the search for the next leader his young as have been a high picking struggle carry College did have some success with them obviously on down to Jake Locker another firstround pick invested to try to solve the quarterback position but all those faces may be very few longterm antics have a thick graphic Mettenberger in their fires and printed tape off with a tight end with the first a lacrosse before yard line his third reception of the year the path protection dealers come with a blitz they pick it up and out of the playaction pass rifles Berger excuse me it looks like Roethlisberger is Mettenberger showing poise in the pocket and finding chase Hoffman a backup tight end is filling in for Delanie Walker well done 18 Boston safety I really like waiting rough across the 45 yard line mark him down after a gain of about four yards John we mentioned Jake Locker the number eight overall pick in 2011 that started a few games this season for at all but once again he's on the bench I just can't stay healthy Mike and you're not available and you miss practice time in game time it's hard to say that you want to be a part of that as a head coach and they want to see what that met Bergesen do all the locker still has a lot of talent I think in a future in this league but got to stay healthy get sick your husband goes down no rivets at about by my special justice he was trying to get the tones down and we're being complete would be third and six covergirl you can see the arm talent of Mettenberger the ability that throw the ball to the sideline area on a rope good call by the official Hunter has to do a better job tracking the sideline wait what your father just in time now in the organize the first down backtoback pitches for confidence many pitches of his bribe as we've had all season this off there was a great receiver at Missouri ice picked up by leon washington on the left side and hoffman number 86 on a slant burst release comes out of this break nice and flat Boswell thrown again by Mettenberger I'm impressed with the way the Titans have picked up the blitzes but you have to be impressed with this young quarterbacks ability to work in the pocket bishop thank you and a holy penalty is going to be called on can't Warmack of the Titans their right guard first round pick last year holding offense number 70 10yard penalty first out John had mentioned Jake Locker earlier and Locker was part of the starting group Fisher Charlie Whitehurst also started some games as locker got injured and then they turned to Mettenberger for his third start locker is healthy again he is the backup that right thumb injury the second injury he suffered this season has healed the white herd streak the inactive third quarter back the three different quarterbacks is started for the team now they're seeing what they have in the sixth round event after the Titans first penalty of the night at first and 20 yet further rich wants a hunter great pants and road Justin huh sir finally steps out of bounds of the 20yard line but it's 35 on the game yep to the Steelers secondary starting to show there is no like Taylor Cortez Allen has been benched by being ineffective playaction pass they just throw a simple dig route the hunter and Lincoln gave false out Pittsburgh has given up way too many explosive past plays this seasoning that's the second time the veteran William gay get speech timeout taken by Tennessee they've had a couple of times this week here where their communications that come up as a point of conversation with the young quarterback a few times here tonight they've been late getting to the live and think of those defense tries to figure out what stem the tide here Titans have 273 yards of offense here on only 26 plays that they've run here tonight they're averaging 10 yards for blood this dealer defense is missed and missing erotic starters Steve McClendon and those tackle Polamalu the safety Ike Taylor's a shutdown corner shades here Jarvis Jones to number one draft choices but Tennessee has this Steeler defense on the ropes they've just given up too many big plays they play clocks running down again they broke the huddle where they were getting ready to break the home Hill we had 10 in Jackie paddle the fullback was good he's really not on the same page still first attempt of the night Dean met Berger came into game to get the ball I'm very close to the first down inside the 10 yard off Jackie battle has lined up in that position all year and the Titans usually motion them into the backfield and used them as a fullback that time they snapped the ball on a quick count he runs a pattern into the flat and Jason world wasn't ready for it Ken Whisenhunt is doing a nice job with his game plan breaking some tendencies and he's all five eligible one for the first gap and for the touchdown Mettenberger Patrick cactus and he did a very good experience type play of knocking the ball down there as he was coming back Keizo second time a deflection tonight none of the long time you read a short set by the quarterback you know it's a quick pass you're not going to get there raise your hands try to pass the ball down you're seeing a lot more of that in pro football massive substitutions on both sides of the ball heavy personnel pirates singly 68 crossly the defensive lineman 97 all come in any set big bodies to block John Green to pound put the gold gonna see did they ever found oh that name Carl clue playing fullback you bring in a defensive tackle you use the ex New York jet who fumbled last week on the goal line on a little power play off the right thigh when Marla you got a kick out blocking Lewallen number 20 would rather take on a pullback kakie through your line that respect I'm like you might not like the sink yeah 1,900 yards 20 touchdowns last year as a Washington husky he's come here and led the Titans in rushing as a rookie hasn't fumbled the football he can catch it it'll be a good bro let's see if the Titans and lean on this offensive line in his situation last time they spread them out they got cooled by a sealer Blake yes from the poorest of the pressures pick up by stinky and mint burger and throwing his Guidry tremendous which pickup the young running bag game as quarterback sometime but nobody was open if Harrison got dumped came off his left side were another rookie Taylor luan working against James Harrison Harrison has really picked up his pass rush in the last month of this season nice picked up by Bishop Sankey birdie go and want to get in the game the third down back next to met further losses to the back of the end zone Hoffman went up Coffman couldn't find a place in Cincinnati was let go the Falcon hit wanted in Atlanta and Hoffman has two over three fake catches the put the tightens up News fours have confidence in your tight end it will often get it that bad Hoffman he's at this kid was an outstanding receiver of Missouri and that's a heck of a throw by Mettenberger Nolan is personnel in a matchup that he had James Cochran won the Mackay award the top 10 in the country named after the great John Mackay did that that career of beggary the jawsaw throughout his struggles his injuries couldn't find a place to play Cincinnati in Atlanta it's his sixth year in the league he has six career receptions coming into tonight he had three on that drive career suspect and really Tennessee with Tennessee leading the Steelers by 11 still a ways to go but what a night it could be for Zach Mettenberger kids for your first NFL victory on monday night football against Ben Roethlisberger and the twotime champion Steelers Bevin being a twotime kid force on a night where it's the coldest game you've had here in Nashville the place has so many Steeler fan Terrible Towels were waving you throw a big stick to the opening drive but it's an opportunity that Tennessee has really stayed the course after falling behind 10 nothing else for the fewer 44 to 3 since Wheaton brought down shy of the 30yard line Steve it's good often can pick it up it is Ben Roethlisberger underseas thus far by the Titans defense play off the last five year cycles there are opportunities on the Nazca stage are fewer trying to make the most video that will the stealing Prasad I'll bet to put a few goals tonight Roethlisberger collapsing pockets backed out fires it held aside logic complete trying to make a big play down people it's this one glitch after another and the secondary of the Titans has held up and I don't even recognize the secondary the Titans they use every man in the secondary room every week goatee sense of ball bleeding ray Wilson Stafford they've all made plays tonight and the Steelers have got a five Ben Roethlisberger some protection quick Ray Horton showed this to Joe Flacco and the Ravens last game from excitement Dell running left put the big top turn got out near the 35 yard line Mike Collins team is the very good at Heinz Field this year four and one they have put up the points belongs to the Jets last we've had a lot of folks scratching their head you but you have to Steelers solve and here they come on the road the only touchdown they scored against you gentlemen late in that game and no offensive touchdowns to get here tonight on the road well you can see why they've been eight Nate the last two seasons they just been inconsistent in three brown line up the slot and look at that way escaping artery to the first down and Roethlisberger will just shy of the 40yard line the great effort by Roethlisberger they come with another cross dog which both inside linebackers lift together Rocko's burgers just speak Derek Morgan for the first down and pointed Pittsburgh need that one great effort spoken a lot of the relationship with Roethlisberger over the years can loosen up with his offensive coordinator Brady Hortons the defense accordion for the Titans was there when Ben got going and he called the Penta good athlete he can make plays even things alive that usually don't see out of a six foot five man we've seen that over the pick city to another and downtown a sidewalk and throttle down to 34 yard line Gudrun of 27 propel second time I've seen Ben Roethlisberger check watching raises are me ticks from one plate to another and you're going to see the Castro at right guard get a hook block right here on riccati that tol it to an off his bail to the outside lady on bail over a hundred yards he's closing in on a thousand that's a great job by Roethlisberger audibly we'll run play we're in the 100 yard game season for Cal who add to it hit by Kristen after a gain of 11 and the first step Griffin and fell at real speed you want to be a pro football player listen to this Michael Griffin he's been known for Bing tell me whether right staffers come down and see me spots help me so gently you can see with rappelled vertical mic he knows it's one glitch after another that got he ran the ball again away from the overloads with some time running the ball away from these exotic windage is the best thing you can do baltimore hurt tennessee were similar runs last week Miller Miller to the 5yard line third quarter comes to an end this bird has found the right protection they're picking up these blitzen's and they're on the move 24:13 Tennessee after three on Monday Night Football fivedegree night in Nashville Steelers a solid favorite in this game my colleague Steve awful awesome Jets after getting hot bringing up backtoback by Roethlisberger six touchdown pass game never been done by a quarterback in league history but it looked like they were in position for the Steelers to continue with 10 twizzler who once was the offensive coordinator for Pittsburgh when Roethlisberger broken the team his sick from Ricky Zach Mettenberger come up with the big play Titans lead by 11 Steelers get closer to a one score game on this Drive fourthquarter begin first of all let me on fellow reaches to the goal line schooling for the touchdown the head Wiseman on the nearside had moved in shy of the goal line the lime dressing the part I came in and said he was in for the school beautiful play he Miller tied in number 83 did a nice job on the backside and I think Bell is in there the player felt Liz then raffles burgers scramble on third down to keep this drive alive does help Pittsburgh back in this game nobody will go out to take a perhaps a hit for time at that angle you see an ting stretch when a body part came down and the point of the ball break the plan the hand down gave him the most possible distance to reach out break the plane waiting for confirmation of the score this is looked at 3a on the field and a touch pad entire corner reserve that hey comes down with the left hand comes down as he's extending the ball so this will need further inspection if they touch down are right on the edge go long first year referee Brad Allen consultation with D Blandino the lead vice president of officiating he's back in New York at the art mcnally game day central where they monitor all the games that a look at this ruled a touchdown RB here the Royal Phyllis confirm press out just before that hit comes down the ball gets to the part of the flames of hell scores the rushing touchdown first offensive touchdown for Pittsburgh tonight second for Bell on the season as some coaches at this point late 3rd or early fourth quarter like we are now and start to play that key point chart like clavicles has more scores to come so you'll take the extra point when squeeze them bang at a four point game 44 just one we're here at LP Field in Nashville and right outside of the seals of course our Monday night bus and sitting on the bus stay in warmth as long as you can watching the games Ray Lewis get your whole favor the linebacker break then this is a game that feels like the old AFC North days with Baltimore played Pittsburgh and games you had with the Titans as well great defensive pressure really forcing the tempo for both sides tonight you know what you don't see there's no more in this rivalry right because they don't play each other as much but back in the old AFC North this is what these rivalries look like you just never know which way the games is going to go always close games one of the things that impressed me the most is how tend to see how hardhitting Tennessee's defense is right now and how much they're blitzing Pittsburgh right now you know you would think they would do the opposite and sitting zone but that's what a lot of those screens the Antonio Brown comes open its things so the way they're challenging them tonight is really this really interesting to see come on ray you're up four points you're playing Ben Roethlisberger in the Steelers we're in the fourth

an eye on that matchup if you get the oneonone back we'll take about a field goal range pressures of del releases and Bell gets the first down to 22 when you blitz you have to cover your man and he runs a route that time I don't know if it's George Wilson number 21 or who should feel out of this list perhaps went and rode number 53 but benasi just Lula covering that is the back you don't want to have a blown cover to get what are they the Titan 22 pills I love the way he was for yard game there it's almost like he comes to this here watching a horse beer and extracted book now that the hopes come down popo heat gets to hit the ball surveys the defense just almost freezes and then and that exposed blah blah blah I wasn't even like that boom so here Bobo he's a great back versatile he could do at all and he can pick up the Blitz and he never come like it is sick don't forget Dell sold it out run through Griffith get very close to the first down go drop those burgers doing he's hauling two plays in the huddle the alerts one play with another that time he raises his hands and he activates the second play and a lot of these activated activation plays have been run watching raised his fist he turns it into a counter they pulled the Castro the right bar he's feller the tight handoff they felt Polizzi keen Griffith I fell 25 for 155 backroom Johnson in motion Roethlisberger playact here so touchdown Tonio crown if the steering believe he just beat the best do defenders who had a double the 40 and Griffin have Antonio Brown doubled and brown ferns cuoco playaction pass in Antonio Brown on an inside relief with a beautiful hesitation move on Michael Griffin put a route for both is really pretty Pittsburgh offense rolls it is their killer beez orchestrated by feds but the mother King running of Dell the exclamation point was brown my stuff's down catch of the year Pittsburgh backtoback touchdown they lead by three driving over to the stadium about four hours before kickoff and you would find your way through downtown here to the stadium right along the Cumberland River you pass through a stretch and restaurants and bars and I look at you as I've never seen this many fans of the road and you see all those Terrible Towels the black and gold here and check out the guy with sombrero all having a good time here is Steeler fans and travel well of a be nine hour or so journey their team was scored backtoback touchdowns to take a threepoint lead the substantivity kickoff return he had a terrific night thank you turning the corner and rut down finally by BW Webb crossing the 35 yard line Thank You Livie on bells let's ditch performances phil has ruffled further after the struggle to the first half better second half and often now pendants jump tennessee on this in your teen spot left at quarterback running back all working but they respond in a game where they have led for majority of a second to third quarter and out for him by 3 that Mettenberger got tom you have anybody open get the guns again mental right working the sideline had the first down and step back we're going to still get the first down just past the 46 handle right on a shallow cross they were looking for Justin Hunter teeth nobody was open I shop I met Berger binding Kendall Wright productive slot receivers batburgers growing forty forty eight to nineteen touchdown harrison adhesion to take guns Lorex Timmons right the middle of it as well Brett Keisel choose up blocks he keeps his inside linebackers clean and some of these running backs they try to cut the ball back they forget how hard Keisel can hit what a Pittsburgh Steeler what a bargain he has been former seventh round draft choice clearly a leader on this beautiful ball giggle right hold on incomplete I'll be third shooting like same quick screen a ran in the first half with great success hard to beat a Pittsburgh Steeler defense coached by Dick LeBeau twice on the same play good pursuit and even right caught that clean he was going nowhere James Harrison we shot in his vision perhaps got a finger on it Malone 877 that complete Holland wits with Ken Whisenhunt good friend when they were on the same path 30knot Mettenberger throws its not.but to get us in a run Derek Hagen so he'll be three yards shy of the first down example yarder job excuse me again but Mike the net burgers got to make this bro somehow some way Pittsburgh comes with a blitz an accurate throw in front of the receivers numbers would give Hagen a chance to run for the first down but backtoback third down blitzes at fourth Tennessee's offense off the field that punch last time by curve son tries to hit Pittsburgh at p3 the 20 the 38 towards Earth it's not accepted it lets you and me at home the college hoops marathon underway a great doubleheader in Indianapolis tomorrow Tom Izzo's Spartans against Coach K's super Devils and a top five matchup Candace and number one Kentucky the whole court of how juicy as the end that marathon gets with season goes the games all night tonight all day tomorrow headlined by those two in the Circle City for the great programs in the history of the three stealing five points on seven minutes left the arm fell here five doggone awesome beautiful touchdown play Dantonio Brown he beats a double McCourty at the bottom of the screen Michael Griffin at the top you can't do it any better Kelvin beats them at left tackle does an excellent job given Roethlisberger the time and you can't square defender up and come out of your break any better than Antonia Brown just did it there's a lot of big receivers that are having big years but well that kid is it fills anyone I've seen 88 catches on the year for breath pressure coming Roethlisberger just got rid of it and fell now kind of an incomplete pass he never had it Kamerion Wimbley as a big free hit on Roethlisberger was floating it out then hurt loading it up allout blitz again Wimbley untouched off the edge 95 at the bottom your screen he never blocked the most dangerous to the inside Pittsburgh one short pass protection he'll never really secures that so that's why it's an incomplete pass and not a fumble and all the scrum and stuff happen there are some big hits in this game Griffin hits Bell and Wembley hits Roethlisberger let's see if n is okay in Pittsburgh takes a timeout here to give Roethlisberger a chance to make sure he is okay go back over thee now three years and Todd Haley is the offensive coordinator the reason why is so Ben doesn't take those kind of incident ray Horton is certainly Philly Dick LeBeau all that he taught him over the years by the blitzes the pressures have been scaling tonight he's calling two plays in hollow Mike he's falling one play for a Titan defense it's not Clifton and if he sees the blip you'll see it raises do handsy kill the blade to another one that's designed to beat the blip so he's going to call few plays here and then get up to the line of scrimmage quickly and crying diagnose what it's going to be bleeding great we'll turn the corner or 10 if you have a back injury and this has been challenged I believe by Ken Whisenhunt Kenneth E is challenging the ruling of the field of incomplete pass if l have it or not that's his question they'll take a look at it the first aspect of the catch is firm grip control and I don't think that ever happened and Tennessee question that does they challenge Brad Alan has taken a look at it a firm grip and control the ball then get the two feet down with time to perform an act common to the game able to do something with it all those criterias being a catch after reviewing the play the ruling of an incomplete pass is confirmed the pass is incomplete Tennessee is charged with a timeout and those are the first time how you might need the threepoint game in 6:07 to go that's about the fifth big hit that Michael Griffin as laid down tonight third down and poor patents as six offensive back down low linebacker in the working Williamson instead of looking who might come Adam here they come got rid of it quick we can caught it first came across 30 to the 31 Marcus Wheaton only to bring it all out blitz the cornerbacks know the ball is coming out quick they should have inside technique that time weakness heat support easily for the first down did you see Ramone Foster's a left guard he's going to be tapping the center pal see when raffles burgers ready for the ball so how he can survey the flippin height the shadows give me a couple more minutes to run off the clock now careerhigh eight carries any accelerate again and delivery below on George Wilton on that quickie seventh carry of the night you run a counter play you need a guard that can pull and kick out the epic Astro 66 does it beautifully fill 171 yards tonight six Willie Parker less I'm Aquila has been that many running yours and fell to any Talent 181 and the Titan can't stop if de Castro is wearing out the outside linebackers of the Titans right guard is going to pull and trap hammer and Wembley you'll see will counted 46 up inside against Michael Griffin this is oldschool Pittsburgh Steeler football goes on their offensive line right now John Mike Munchak is going to be so sweet for him was the tightened head coach the last three seasons if not the divine that struggled in the season struggled in the first half five black Caracas burger and they've sent us out here in the third and the fourth and delicate hit hit now eight yards and tighten to love the timeout on that challenge inside the forbids to running out of job there ball runner Mike PAL Fiat Center foster at left guard right guard to Castro Sammy Hill number 94 get doubled off the strand it closed in time I would run the ball again behind pal C in the Castro right just made major substitutions up front 67 to Pittsburgh tonight I'm jealous cause our flu comes over make the play with it thinking gotten up for the first half the 39 yard line as we get close to three minutes left with two timeouts for Tennessee agent one that's one way that you keep these defensive tackles from being doubleteam let's everybody Sammy Hill 94 99 jerel Casey got a takedown beat now because they know what's coming everybody in the stadium knows what comes lady ourselves 250th cut of the year he still has his fumble Moffit if he got him they took that one to the 30 it closes in on a 200 yard rushing night as we get close to the twominute warning Michael Griffin 33 misses a tackle here and it just shows you incredible elusiveness from Le'Veon Bell he's got power fidget he's a great receiver he's elusive he lost a lot of weight Mike and he's going a long way and it just hit the 200 yard walk at the twominute warning Stewart leading by three chilly and close here in Nashville hida folk speed medium for Stuart Scott one more time here and coming up a lot of SportsCenter the GMC postgame report Ray Lewis Trent Dilfer Steve young to help you break down his very tight affair will have the top place and week 11 around the National Football League in the fellas will react what rg3 had to say yesterday and his tweets today that's all coming up on school Center immediately following the game upstairs the Mike and John Mike that foots better not being closed up there by not a chance tell me about it again we're talking to it a freezer for four hours oh my in a very entertaining night to say the least 200 yards or labium Bell eating one of those dark after contact have a multi second and of course you write back the valley got the first down paedon state uses that one remaining timeout at 154 to go using great king be right back first down no timeouts inside a few minutes the Steelers are scolded on this night when Libyan Bell did something that drift Franco Harris Barry Foster and Jerome Bennett at Steelers did not do run for 300 yards there's three other men into Willie Parker Frenchy few quid on every gone to the other Steelers to run for 200 yards in a game it's behind the live C yard loss Griffin with the stop these are the time that when you're a play caller or you're an offensive lineman you know it's going to be a running play ball you know the defense knows and everybody in the stadium knows and you still continue to run the ball right down their throat and I am shocked we have not seen LeGarrette Blount at all tonight it has been all they've got Bell this for a snap he was working the math and the clock management and this is where that should have been when they were inside two minutes and had it first down Griffin tried to get over there to the other side quickly Kenseth takes me one more time and that will do it the huge whiff excuse to get to seven is board is right behind Cincinnati by percentage points in the AFC North when you look on that Pittsburgh sideline you see Ike Taylor down there there's upstanding corner Troy Polamalu Ryan shazier Jarvis Jones two firstround draft choices Steve McClendon they have five outstanding defensive players coming back after the by next week with this offense look out lots of Steel is over and one more you see the key games left Baltimore we see next week at the India's remaining schedule Pittsburgh and toughest but as we've seen in the NFL so hard to figure out what will happen next Cincinnati and Pittsburgh

Washington goes left into 36 yard line I mentioned right asking for you to pick John Hickey strength is his armor good strong line how question and Pittsburgh respects his arm talent but he's got to play mentally faster and he's got to play physically quicker in the pocket especially against the defense like the Pittsburgh Steelers get for mental and physical quickness in the pocket that's where he needs to make his greatest improvement right for Jay through multiple back Dexter McCluster over chief is their high snap hold down by Beck Berger right working through space with a flat gaminess

they're going to get it there at agent number 80 was held on the play so the Steelers will start deep in their own territory turn the return holding or a bigger game after this with the bow for foul he showed you can't Whisenhunt me and he replaced his back in the stadium tonight Mike Munchak Hall of Fame gar 32 years with this organization the types of coursework but Houston Oilers before that 22 and 26 is the head coach in three years Tennessee he had another year on his deals hoping to stay but Madison wanted a big bunch of staff changes that much was not comfortable with the higher wisdom above jacket now hooked on is the Steelers office of like oh the Hall of Famer is rounding this through to keep safe the middle of every first pass by Roethlisberger support payments right that was a pretty sensible after shorted are cavas Bryant came in here averaging over 22 yards of kit he's picking up this Pittsburgh Steeler playbook they're asking him to do more and more Mike Tomlin tried to say hold on here he's not ready for the Pro Bowl yet they're expecting more from him as the season unfold and the Titans continue to flick Ben Roethlisberger here they are up in his face again as Spain comes down to protect Roethlisberger's with the size motive breakdown of the 32yard line he's a Steeler favorite playaction pass and Heath Miller break down the scene you run Le'Veon Bell every play in the opening possession and you fake it the baladi forget he teller has over 500 catches as a fifth burst dealer 4:32 Livia Tellez rocked out like a sea captain of his defense described by wonderful science coaches with a really good athlete defense that for the quality attended a snack last year he is a one gap penetrator has really flourished in a 43 defense but now with the new defensive system in place he tried to blade in a 34 scheme what he has proven is it doesn't matter what defense he plays in at kicking what port acted for the first nine Steeler plays today they've had more pressure except in a moment for up a burger it will lose the hit from sideline it is caught my place see your child first out what a throw I don't know how raffles burger pulls this off he makes more completions after being compact in the pocket just watch this he's going to drop back to pass the Blitz is on it pushes up in the pocket and he throws a bullet the only place that ball could have been gross that ball was always in a throwing position he can unload it accurately silly to to the first day well over the top for the first town by Antonio Brown John you mentioned when he gets hit he still is so good but surely the numbers this year always put in these categories completion percentage after being hit by a player 80% doubled almost with aliquots passing yards per pack double six touchdowns no picks usually got get hit they the thrown ticks and the passer rating 158 to give you a scale the passer a that's almost the maximum passer rating if the passer ratings on the FM dial in between 90 and 100 eight it's really good if it's higher goes off the chart and then is so we build here if you were again 34 yard line never completes this 122 yard wellhe feller comes out of his stance white doesn't half of his route he's so friendly to the quarterback watch this route he's going to push straight up the field fender to the outside he creates separation and Roethlisberger read it perfectly you nod to the outside Mike you keep yourself away from the free safety and you avoid that hit filler nose out of play tight in Arius a word days it's the picture reader first round for the race WFL lowers the shoulders who gets the first down here with 22 yard line here comes some big defensive lineman for the Tennessee Titans 90 to 99 Sammy Hill 94 they need some reinforcements this is an undersized Tennessee Titans defensive line they've been plan of war three for a long time here and they're trying to get to a threefour defense and they have struggled stopping the run in Pittsburgh nosey Ray Horton the defensive coordinator here protege opposed played for him both with him as he pleased when lasted for the printed form a gel weights to the right side he stops on the edge Avery Williamson along there with Wesley Woodyard you pointed out the side he with effective lino that's why so often a transition from a 4:3 to the 3/4 takes a couple of years personal walk currently does and you have to credit gray horse the defensive coordinator and the job that he's done it the way he stopped the run is by blitzing Tennessee is blitzing more than they've lifted recent years and that's one way that you gang up on the run but when you do that you isolate your corners in oneonone coverage good luck again show the quick there's the looking moon knocking on the door Roethlisberger take the shot it open his crying wouldn't pull that truck out in bleeding rain whooping arrives at the last second then was late with the ball didn't get much on him but that's a double boom they're trying to sell a bubble screen Bryant made it look like he was blocking he has wide open real estate hinges did get it hang on the throw you a welcome to beat badly hey a nice recovery Thursday look back to the ball in hand just got between the arms of the receiver third and now here comes the pressure Roethlisberger higher Brown puts the beat down inbound first people prefer to fish that's a great roll timing we saw Mettenberger miss and outside breaking route on the first play of the game that time Ben Roethlisberger free steps no hitch false wrong with perfect timing and location and it sets up a first a goal just outside the five those two are like clockwork nobody doing it better right now at quarterback and receiver that Roethlisberger and antoniou Brown goes after that 14 1 complete since the big day of the opening quarter started back to the road kissed at the yard Avery Williamson Steeler running an unbelievable thought heylia of all kind of plays on that sheet at County ran his own breed the player sandy college quarterback run there are a lot of different types of runs that's why Roethlisberger has a wrist pant that goes all the way up to four are very a lot of formations of different kinds of plays to get these skill players involved 15 bottom quarter of the week and Rick go Morris meet Miller is about discrete running back bells in the slot Titan for taken up take this week we're going to confuse tear down then we'll try to get on the same page those items were confused Leedy ray Wilson came over late the cover Le'Veon Bell there's a lot of different alignment that both of these defenses presented and they come off the same tree Mike's ruffler to prepare for this game by going up against his own defense because that's where Ray Horton the defensive coordinator of the Titans come from plays per kilogram office burger out quick for cryin maximum coverage we be ray Wilson go Black Hawk Down immediate ray Wilson has had 10 penalties this year he's had six P I pass interference calls and he has a good no call there he me ray Wilson with backtoback red zone plays and zips up sweep them again 49 now 53 this team missed from last week that one through field goals here for the Steelers of their drives the picks it verifies it someone that the Steelers consecutive eight eight seasons they had missed the playoffs the last two years trying to change that around this year but in part because of the divisions they're matched up against the weak divisions AFC South and North the AFC North has had success everybody's over 500 repeat 64 trailing the Bengals we got the win in New Orleans yesterday six three well that time might prove to be beneficial as we go down the stretch in terms of having that half game edge on the other breed of division 5th kickoff on this opening quarter get on the ground to get to the way from folks in it or you can return this side of the 40yard line for the site second time Luke is returned one push to jump and going on players excitement Steelers they separate without a flag being row third fried fermented in a moment oldies but goodies Brett Keisel back there 36 years old James Harrison 36 years old the Steeler defense continues to play without two other veterans Ike Taylor the forearm injury where Polamalu visiting another game with the knee injury defense in the league that is for players 33 or over we look at the guys respected by the working thinking he's nine on that road job and you don't have a quarterback that you move around you blitz them right up the middle on the first play of the game Laurens timid game Harrison flips together they caused an interception then on the next series they blitz two linebackers on a cross dog it was a fiveman protection Mettenberger beat the bliss then it's another cross dog and bits of stanky number 20 Nicholas Bates in there with center Brian went rip the Steelers in a big play expect more pussies tonight Sean green is the running back they're bringing an extra offense enlivening three powers it into fewer territory for the first down at the 48 yard line for the former New York Jets five grads nobody punted exciting first quarter in Tennessee Steelers lead 15 to 70 on Monday Night Football ESPN celebrating 45 years of Monday Night Football to be fired in Arizona Ken Whisenhunt was the offensive for day with the charges when he had Philip Rivers to work with last year John talked about rivers and met murders similarities perhaps Cole Rivers has incredible quickness in the pocket awkward releases clock in his head he might not be the fastest quarterback when rivers is quick and that's what Mettenberger has to get better at you can see the difference he got to get quicker in the pocket quick in his relief they tried to shorten his base a little bit they're trying to get him acclimated to the NFL speed and the only way to do that is to go out and play and expect that Burger to get better and better the more he does play but he's going against the Steelers and they're going to continue to challenge him the flickers second quarter begins leading 137 from the 5048 of pittsburgh Mettenberger fire right head it is run in if it is attached for extra McCluster 17yard air nice shot by Michael or at right tackle and you have to do a great job as a quarterback in this league keeping your eyes downfield pushing forward in the pocket with two hands on the ball and that's how I met Berger throws a strike but McCluster a man that they are trying to find a role for the ex Kansas City chief first four years of Kansas City really game allows energy special team and from scrimmage Sean green and again with the extra offensive lineman and he runs to the right that only games a yard that Lawrence Tibbett able to bring him down we talked about the Steelers ones playing tonight one of the reasons they've been struggling a bit on the run dough Steve McClendon on the nose but working out of Tennessee Daniel McCullers making first NFL start John spent and hits Williams for sharing inside linebacker spot time with Timmons to continue that to Brian chanes here and again no I killer dope Omalu gay with the tick tick back there in the secondary there is Polamalu we played almost every snap for a year and a half until that 93 came up the last couple of games accidental right kind of watch as Greek key right inside the Senate gets to play line he's down at the six another foot down the Kendall right as great ball handling they've been running the stretch place Thank You sport earlier on the play they sell it and watch Taylor hewan act like he's got off the back side and he feeds the screen out on the perimeter beautifully executed and Kendall Wright convert jacket attack which walks all the way down field as well with Justin Hunter I like the athleticism a paler Alana left tackle the former Michigan Wolverine Mikey trying to take the lead but Buster is down the back that burner flip got rid of it the cluster cook reel it in well we did talk if I speeding up the process and after a big play you better assume the blitz is coming that time if Mettenberger is a little quicker with the ball he might seem a bluster coming out of his back field on this hot round that should be a touchdown and that's where Tucker his mobility is not there and he's a young quarterback he's doing expression he could be on that spot a lot they know where he is he's got a great arm as that's what he needs to drive look and be quick with the succeed in the league of the stick around for back buster now here's a twoyard live really trying to get a cluster involved a lot against people opposed blitzing defense try to get that speed out no oneonone matchup here tonight I want to see this offensive mind live up to their building they have a lot of resources in this line Luanne's a high number one Warmack at right guard a high number one draft choice they brought in the victory the left guard from buffalo michael or the X Baltimore Ravens I'd like to see him run the ball behind them and it's taking a Boston's pudding after we trying to get to the line of scrimmage Mike Mitchell and Will Allen come to get them and it will be fourth down I think the quarterback needs to see the all outlets the Titans are outnumbered there's not much they can do to block Mike Mitchell you saw I just tripped right over met burgers foot burgers right foot Sankey's clip each other the running back goes down don't know to what he got in there anyway because that bliss like you said here come suck up the field goal extra point size field goal for the former teeth picker Ryan suck up 20 ours threepoint game visit hunt trying to find something that will get this Titans franchise going once again trying to start building trade either with deck meant we're here to play the end of this drop oh the Steelers outnumber up here and they're releasing Taylor Dhawan on some kind of quick stream but Mettenberger needs to take a timeout they need a different play at the 2 yard line some of these spread and runs are beautiful things when the defense plays own but when they allout blitz you those are dead plays Whisenhunt can't be happy with that one there are those the growing pains of the quarterback in 3rd start doesn't know down there like a Brady or a banning or a rivers check something that obviously it's going to work against this work yeah that's part of it again sometimes you can't get Duke you asking to do too much that hurts at the 2 yard line Ryan suckup with the kickoff on his school night ou get cool Marcus Wheaton across the 20 drop down side of the 25yard line Oh last week it was a blender there's no chopped meteor you're not going to make actual burgers but we got a battle over the burgers here tonight this is the burger bowl but look at Roethlisberger he's got playmaking skills he's got body type he's got a lot experience on his burger precision supporting cast and Mettenberger he's just he's got armed talent on his birdie he needs to get some more fixings on there he's in the process of doing that as a young quarterback but clearly Ben Roethlisberger is 17 and OH against rookie quarterbacks for a reason Brent Musburger could be here tonight he could be appropriate first to be here for the battle of the burgers Mettenberger Robert Ferguson quarterback to both of 6 to 5 both were number 7 first down set rockin toss is broken up good job by Michael Curtis safety and that was waiting in the air and came over to get at Tony O'Brien that is a great range play by Michael Griffin the longest injured Tennessee Titan he's playing a free safety he's going to come out of the middle and drive his deep drops he sees it all the way his eyes are right out that rocket burger he's read to route perfectly and timed it just right the Steeler fans got there a hair earlier they have to complain about that bump you saw by the replay just a hair before the ball got there Griffin got away with it trying to get the front down by the other same team George Wilson was an undrafted wide receiver with Detroit maybe they've his specialty performer Buffalo now the starting safety before the print our collards Tennessee injury comes right off your left side on a strong safety when he chases this play down on the backside serve down in the webbing watch the movement from this Tennessee defense they try to disguise their coverage and they're blitzing throughout the down no running back for the peelers breast 40 giving Roethlisberger a ton of time and he finally front down flavor finally on the open downfield but finding them enough time and Quinten grows with the sack well the night has got lucky three Archer at the bottom of the screen number 13 is going to be wide open coming on this little wheel route at the bottom of the screen been never fall threeman rush and Tennessee dodged a bullet usually Big Ben season first sack for the former Jacksonville Jaguar ropes knife of his career first punt of the evening either team of the Aussie Brad wait flustered and a runup to get it 47 on the return it's William the linebacker with the Sun he's 38 good field position for the title keep em stop Pittsburgh or something ESPN's but a night football is brought to you by Lexus introducing the first ever 306

down by Keisel good job by Brett keys will get a hand up in Naga gotta keep an eye on his matchup on the left side hey Lulu on the rookie out of Michigan against the veteran James Harrison that time Harrison used the pole rush and the Juan showed some anchor if that will be a matchup throughout the night especially on the second and long and third round situation the one against the shorter James Harrison you can have to spend a theme and I to the cluster the back race just best pumped up to date to play hogs been splitting time with bits Williams that inside line back to read the screen perfectly and makes it impact tackle watch left guard and ela be three number 67 got to get there quicker perhaps battle got too wide to fast but you see the anchor of Taylor the want got to be careful with those hands James Harrison was pointing out to the umpires located back behind the quarterback on that side back to the bid hands to the face 3rd 15 Leon Washington over get in there with McCluster perfect pass over the middle gonna be three shy of the first task as Justin Hunter able to catch it Markham's just inside the 45 the guy gets to the 42 for the first down quick looking slant by the slot receiver and let Berger shows not only a straw harm but a quick release at the nice job by Mitchell number 23 the one where the stakes were and making the tackle for the first down Antonio Brown Act to receive 124 yards return around this year pressure making an unreturnable pick round makes the fair cap Anatole 30yard luck though he settled in it the teams exchanged punches halfway through the second quarter Steelers leave 5 3 the face of the franchise back on the field when we come back empirical John Burton Lisa Salters on a cold November night in Nashville coldest temperatures of start of a game and practice have been here in Nashville poor form stealer drop the service continues to depression hates hillier hit by Michael Marisa scores game it's an allout list again backed up on the 10yard line gray horn brings everybody and out of nowhere comes Michael Griffin to make a beautiful open field tackle at some point wincing Roethlisberger and the speedy catch and run guys in Pittsburgh finger it is dangerous but they've had success doing it they brought it against Joe Flacco number of times last year fifteen burger on the run Antonio's got a crowd take it out of bounds for the first step beautiful over out on the backside of the bootleg cool the linebackers with the fake Antonio Brown mirrors the quarterback perfectly bubble place last week against the jet uncharacteristically and you expect the Antonio Brown to make the correction we believe in a reception working back in on retake is receiving yards mark here tonight 36 yards jump back on top I'll just put out three Archer if you head attack gets attached to the lofty yards total danger we turned it to a turnover if Stanford was closing in on the rookie Archer out of Kent State 3 archer was hiding behind Ben Roethlisberger in the pistol up surprise Stafford even saw he's about 5 foot 4 he's high by Roethlisberger as a pistol he runs a wide flare to the right he doesn't handle it cleanly yes Cornhusker from Nebraska rocks 3 Archer little Carter the convoy is a private 85 stuck second and 15 with the threeman rush lawful Carter wait with the short down field and pearl to complete the brown pulled out a 30yard line they'll give six shy of the first down Titans defense of us feel like forever trying to hang with those Steeler receivers or the Russian three they use a crazy stunt but they end up rushing three Tennessee Titans they have eight men in coverage and they all have their eyes on Ben Roethlisberger in these five Steeler receivers great job plastering through their man in coverage mid sets up third down five down for ground twenty six in a row and it fell Beth with five acceptance born again now the bring the printer again and please stop here on the side by the head linesman for a false start false reoffense under 77584 doubt marquis guild with the right tackle john every time we go to a Steelers game if we watch the other team practice you here grows plaster plaster bastard and it was feeling forever for those guys trying to hang his Roethlisberger just again blockers away from going to get on out of Menace things done a great job mixing it up they've rushed free drop date they brushed seven and played all out with coverage looks like pressure again third and 11 or pressuring Roethlisberger throws the kiss grounds sideline the pleasure to watch two players on the same page and on time and on target over it oh I thought McCarty had him in covers underneath with help from stafford over the top they're playing mantoman underneath they have them double and it doesn't matter Brown can run any route you can think of from any formation he can beat any defender and he just proved you he can beat any coverage that's why he leads pro football with over 80 X's seven Darius job was not much there lay beyond bail to get it out just shy of it feels we tip under 4minute to this profession told his outside run against these inside blitz this is that the Titans are calling have had some success I am stunned that the amount of blitzing that I have seen from the Titans defense in the last month of this season sooner or later you have to think we're going to take a shot deep I guess one I want cover Oh Titan territory pulled out of 43 by Wesley Woodyard at a first down for lady I'm bill Oh forgive me the center is a firstround draft choice the Castros the first round draft choice Gilbert number 77 the second round draft choice slam the fall right off that right side and expect results well done cell has been limited 56 yards rushing again he has 66 to the first half tonight about two or three for Miss Tennessee Titan defense is being led by a rookie Mike number 54 Avery wolf Williamson you don't find a rookie linebacker often that calls the signals for a defense he's a big round draft choice from Kentucky he's got a lot on his plate set the pump communicate with coverage has been given his fellow defender some alert McGarrett welcome to the game we get close to 50 minute warning to playoff jumping come back we're going to the ball but now it's trucked out right reporte you're like Derrick Morgan over first round pick out of Georgia Tech great bed down on the yard it's a cute Institute awarded and one could be fine here at he was fearful that I football sandwiches what gala support London I win it was often limited to six points they have he picked six by William King on the Titans first drive the reason there are three benefited 55 left still hot sir today Antonio's Brown recording pulls him down his alive could it be a first down inside the 32 we saw Roethlisberger raised his two hands he killed one play with another he sees the Blitz coming Roethlisberger changes the protection to a quick throw slant pattern to the right side in Antonio's Brown keep supporting you get in the sense that they're starting to feel the ways they can beat this pressure from Tennessee start maxing the perfection throwing it quick and work Antonio Brown he's oneonone isolation twenty eleven percent 105 to go grovel burger is one tough customer standing in the pocket bodies flying around them and then six foot five inch length event rifle burger can see over the three throws of other actors the heat Miller timeout taken by the Steelers here is 105 to go Pittsburgh had the Tennessee's one there's merit coming up with the Toyota Hamsun love the stories we'll be covering and import with the insider notes with a lot of movement throughout the day and especially over the last couple of hours on the atria Peterson story works been all over that to the lab at everything else package quarks you'll hear to Nick on SportsCenter coming up mom's joy and a half done it was 55 hours left a minute 53.6 / delete of the 24 furder to the end zone work it up try to get it before Davis right and we listened and had one of the better for having keypad you walk they love throwing these double post patterns into read though they clear out the safety thirtynine with an upper receiver and Bryan's got to catch his football hit him right in the chest and maybe Fleener a got a piece of that Mike I just ate play that's the third path leading rare has broken up the pass in the red zone I will give it and they'll go back to the Rowan she'll be there in waiting because the Steelers have time out to use like Tom Lee will take 152 seconds left third down coming up we'll be right back ten games average of six points per game Steelers get in the last two minutes of the first or second half tops of the league we'll see how they do here getting to get to the ten to keep the drive alive Antonio Brown looking at will come to that one present is intercepted and recording with him take it and take the cup back characteristic bad decision by then Rocco's three lifts off his left eye baby I'm Bella picking it up there's no time there's nowhere to go with the football you got it throw it away kick the field goal great let's pick up off the left side Griffin against Bell I didn't see anybody open and there's nothing wrong with throwing the ball away and coming away with point turnovers have doomed the Steelers in some games that they should have won this year everybody talks about them losing last week Jets they lost the pampered through games they probably should have won but turnovers hit a mint in those games and those are the kind of plays it caused you to lose right breaks courts the middle there Roethlisberger makes the throw that intercepted he was at one time out in the 44 seconds and Titans are a little unorganized there they have to burn a timeout interesting last night saw Brady make a weight first half the state going in for what looked to be a score very uncommon similar story here low Brady was under more to rest last night than Roethlisberger was here so that interception ends a 70 yard drive with no point Tennessee gets the bone start the second half curious to see them do anything but take a knee let the Steelers burn a timeout get the halftime from the 20 men burgers or anything I'll take a shutdown field and the Washington the former scalar it's going to score a touchdown double move William Gale intercepted a pass on the first play the game just aspera get Whisenhunt LZ quarterback let's go get him with a double move as protection lol oh dude William gay beautiful remember John Madden the Superbowl Brady let him down besides the young quarterback is taken in take your chances no attack and go that's exactly what was hunted when everything pointed to just get out of here within three tickle likely get out of here was a lead and NASA looking out the fire it up the stick ground rookie Mickey Bergeron are you get into a bug formation to show something for a couple weeks and then if they'll make Washington put a little hook and go against number 22 William get engage saw this route combination on Kate I'm sure he thought Washington was going to run a hook batter and Tennessee from the double move in a smoke Pittsburgh he points out to Mike linebacker he tells the center to go right handle Timmons engage he pushes he shows some better employee standing in there under fire and he throws a perfect path for six faint Washington and almost a thousand yards last year receiving for the Titan has disappeared a little bit but that kid could play there's not to my finger former teammate it was so excited to play in this TV show the folks in Pittsburgh what a great job they did in building up his career and Roethlisberger sits there and watching Mettenberger come up with B BIG's big play of ADRC Tennessee of fourpoint lead with 32 seconds left until halftime Marcus week to take me from the tube we try to get to be a he'll be some shy the 20 Lisa Salters we you know Washington was focused on this night for that reason right there absolutely Mike I was talking to him this weekend he was telling me how grateful he will always be dealers for taking a chance on him back in 2005 he was an undrafted free agent coming out of a very tiny University in Ohio he said when I do something right I'm proving the Steelers were right even if I get a chance to make a couple of plays tonight hopefully the Rudi's inside though smile and think that's my boy I don't know if they're silent on that one you know I probably not the way it went down no but the point well taken successive Washington tilt out of his career he was at one time out left there alternative crash take one back this incomplete first feelers have attended nothing lead you have to credit Mettenberger with a drive to make it a 107 game the young man is hung in here and this pipe defense has called a lot of different fronts Blitzen and coverages I am full Fitchburg on occasion in this first half the pocket and Phillips going throws on the sack Sean Philips able to get in there and will make the play that will bring the first half to an end stunning first half here in Nashville the end of the first half much like we saw the San Francisco State Lewis game the total bit further half done now here's first Roman prize that first half Jack bet Berger his first half of the half was take it the other way by Williams Gaber pick six inside Ben Roethlisberger the Steelers didn't convert them through their big spots here we are shot from the 1713 Tennessee against the Steelers as we get set for the third quarter with joggers and Lisa Salters Mike Tirico our sales extraordinary moments look some of the moments when the Steelers were getting close but couldn't pay it off till they had martavis bryant on a double move open then didn't get anything on to throw up Leedy ray Wilson broke it up at the last second then he tried a back shoulder fade the lay me off elders leader ray Wilson again and it's a high point made to Mark Davis Bryant again guess who's covering that one and then Roethlisberger made a bad decision off his back foot red zone interception by Jason before T and shortly after that Mettenberger threw a bomb the flippin Titans on top Steelers are in trouble Mike they continue to struggle on the road doesn't matter who they play and the right zone struggles as we said bottom quarter of the league and over to thus far tonight in terms of converting them into touchdowns and Tennessee gets the ball to start the third quarter to win Titan team we mentioned week one they went to Arrowhead and beat the team's 26 to 10 their only other wind was against Jackson Joe the jaguars drove down the field late beautiful attempt to win the game Steele is here on Monday night get off the bishop Thank You Roman yard deep he'll bring it out and just to get over the 20 yard line here's Lisa Salters yes like I asked Ken Whisenhunt what he thought about his young quarterback he said I like the way he responded from a tough start he said there was nothing worse than to come out on Monday Night Football and have your first play be a pick six but he responded well he made some good plays and it's good to see that about that play to Nate Washington I asked him what did you see from the Steelers that made you believe that it would work he said it was affirmation read and based on what they've done before they thought they were going to jump the curl and they did and the play worked my problem said obviously the situation has to be better but it is just one play we gotta move forward like alright Lisa the bookend plays about half really tell the tale Tennessee up for they have the ball and Sankey quick patience as the rookie out of Washington gets here in 27 yard line look at mitten burgers first half well Lisa just said it's a terrible way to start the game throwing an interception it's run back for a touchdown poor location for route 4 results and he throws a deep cross down 10 nothing they come back and answer to make it 107 and right before the half he stands in there under fire and throws a beautiful 80 yards Bob that Nate Washington and here we are thank you second and fourth carry we should be good after contact it's within the yard and has the first down just shy of the 30yard line John when we look at Mettenberger and his success here obviously he played at LSU so he played the big games in big situations as big as you can to prepare for the NFL but what I thought was interesting was last year Cam Cameron was the offensive coordinator at LSU and Mettenberger was essentially done with his academic requirements had one class so in the morning he would get done with that class and spend most of the days of facility give him a chance to understand how to prepare as a quarterback he's doing now here in the NFL with the tightest burden to McCluster releases at in the backfield and then completed he was about to get hit by Brett Keisel and cam Thomas just got rid of it to avoid the sack miss Brett Keisel 36 years old is finding his stride here again a Mettenberger might be hurt Mike Easler plan right defensive tackle on a stunt each swanky the center badly in can Thomas punish Mettenberger deck looked like he hurt his groin he could I on that on a guideline turned to punch it away for Tennessee tonio ground outside the 20 picking up blockers round at the 40 almost pulled down the flag comes down the back end at midfield or question hunk was hanging off with dear life bear he chief Brown was a step away from going a long way but that penalty flag thrown back there this is 34 that wall was being set up for Brown to hit during the return illegal block in the back 10 yards on the foul forced out come out that'll be autumn Arthur boats will erase a 30yard return by brass ESPN's Monday Night Football brought to you by autotrader.com land

  "transcript": "be with a couple of firsthalf touchdown passes one to Gronkowski today's let's sharp Kevin I think we've been just jumping the ball and the other idea that they've done a nice job of spreading out this out this defense and then getting five receivers out in the router Brady dial and getting the ball out quick made it very difficult for Rex to keep down up those blitzes Auto penalties so far on the Buffalo Bills they've had two turnovers and four cents allowed two of eight on third down adjustments they need to make to get back in this game in the second half well I think a couple of things you look at with Buffalo is got to do that first and foremost they've got to be able to continue to run the football they can't abandon the game plan and I think defensively they have to be able to disrupt Brady's rhythm I think for the Patriots offense when we talked about continuing the uptempo approach and jumping the ball and taking the fight to the Bills defense and then finally I think defensively for the Patriots continue to pressure the quarterback and keep everything in front of it don't allow any explosive plays to Harvin or to Watkins in the second half you may recall that the Patriots won the flip of the coin they deferred so they'll get it well bail attacker has put together 14 consecutive winning seasons as the head coach not knowing women sent via Lois that it's one necessarily a situation where the Patriots continue to get topflight talent they just seem to stick solid players that fit what Belichick wants to do whether it's the dion lewis's of the world or whoever players that come in and and fill a role and certainly Dion Lewis has done that the first week and a half to wine the mando jeans winning on opening weekend on kickoff weekend they leave it there through 30 minutes of football rich these are some of the numbers here in orchard one well Buffalo's got plenty to get cleaned up Kevin we talked about the turnovers the penalties they've been sloppy there and offensively I mean it just they can't abandon the running game they've got to be able to continue to run the football they're not built to throw in here 2025 times in the second half late first an injury Sebastian Vollmer hurt his finger he is out cannon as we've mentioned a couple times is in at the right tackle it's Brady with a first intent here comes Williams piling quick throw Lewis incomplete if the coverage in the linebacking corps by brettelmer trial Williams got off Brady really quickly there and you think about Buffalo defense so we can we talk about what they've got to do you got a disrupt Brady you got to get him off the spot maybe he's in a rhythm right now Buffalo hasn't done anything to deter that there is a venema nickel most of the afternoons shutting down engine Dion Lewis Flanders strong grabbed from behind that mill of the 22 hit by Mikkel Ruby and it's a game of two the rookie center David Andrews taking the place that can cost brian stork this is a tough block you can see him right in the middle of your screen he's got to make this this cut block to try and get on the other side at the jump block on Kyle Williams and he just o'clock for any player particularly against a kobold defensive tackle like Kyle Williams spork is on that shortterm ion sucking down 20 Cal Williams a terrific player with a circuit in 20 we've got a draft on the playfun shoulder and he bangs off buddies like a pingpong ball and takes the ball on a kitchen run to the 29:19 yard ticket by julian edelman gently he'll use that term you have to have your head on a swivel and keep it high on Stephon Gilmore there's Nate shoulder it's filled in the water while two people on that front line for the bills wired two of them Andrews right there which when you are on the road and signals is that which are basically using right now to communicate in this kinda noise we have some code words some hand signals it's so hard and this is kind of the world that they live in they're used to it I don't just you got a young Center in there Kevin he's having a very difficult time and in front of them he's got to deal with Marcel Darius and Kyle Williams 16 penalties eight each way it's third down and six down at the park at the right side then cut from husky as he takes a test midfield takes it to the forty nine a buffalo 27 yard catch and run first down Patriots well this is just a mismatch on the linebacker Nigel Bratton I mean yeah I don't know what Rex Ryan's thinking how can you how can you expect a linebacker to cover that guy down the scene first contender grading the loop one down the salt line it is incomplete going for Kronk once again the coverage by the lucky daughter you said nationally this week you don't think there's anybody that can is Darby is catching his breath you don't think rich loose anybody that can guard run Kowski well he's tough I mean it's it's a it's a guy that's so big Kevin I mean he's he's a bigger wide receiver and I think where he is the best it's working in the middle of field it's also the quickest way to the end zones right down the middle of field it's also directly in the business of the quarterback but his size he covers so much ground in the short period and he's catching rate he's his ability to make that back shoulder catch or that that down the field catch and I think for Buffalo the challenges where is he he's never the same spot twice he's an inline player he's on the right side he's on the left side he's in the slot he's outside they move them around so much it makes it very difficult to get the matchup that you want on them he liked Ronald Darby you can see is getting up under his own power but the triangle with a big six six body like grunt Kowski we're gonna feel it let's see here they're right that right side which the Patriots use more to tight ends fits than any team in the NFL we haven't seen it as much today but against Pittsburgh they were using for tight ends inside the red zone it's a great point Kevin and what happens is you have to make a decision as a defense so they bring in the bigger tight ends and then you think to yourself well save running formation I'm going to bring an extra linebackers that's what Pittsburgh did with it what a Brady do they threw the football and so you know you really have to kind of pick your poison Mario Butler will replace Darby last week because of Wade clinch is in to replace him right now shutting down in town lady and is got the former Buffalo Bills Scott Chandler locked out by Graham among a couple it is a gain of nine Chandler at a touchdown reception week one against Pittsburgh and you also have the luxury 7 of having a quarterback that you ditch in the right play at the right time I mean if he sees the situation where you go with the smaller people that he's gonna run it if he sees where you bring an extra linebackers and you have the matchup then he's gonna throw it until I get with 16 years of experience in the same system it's 31 five TVs sits on the line Brady Dobson first down one time by Gilmore takes it to the 29 yard line up up alone ten yard pickup and that's all on Brady he motions in Gronk to block he knows the pressures coming and they just dump it to the flat to Dobson I'm always think about how much volume not much that the quarterbacks got a process when he looks over that defense and only does anybody whose clock is as fast as Brady's when it comes to playing the game former Buffalo Bill Chandler he spent some time here of course five seasons makes the grab he goes for eight but he sent his protections Brady is he's by the canvas the defense there's a lot on his plate as soon as every quarterback yeah but Kevin you invincibly his ability to process information so quickly and efficiency at the line of scrimmage Nilsen seconds he makes his way slips his way and he's down to the age 13 yard pickup Dion Lewis first and goal to go New England why he's so loosen he has that jump cut spin move that helps him slip tackles and he can make a cut without losing speed he's got that quick stop and start moves it just make it so difficult on a defender that's first and goal flag is thrown man we got an offensive penalty well sorry number 67 penalty so first let's think what Brady has done on this Drive in 19yard caching on May Edelman 27 yard catch and run Gronkowski 9 yard pass to Chandler 10 yard pass to Dobson 13 yard run by Lewis a lot of people getting their hands on it they do a good job spreading out and I think it talked about it gotta find a way that the slow Brady down so and it's not easy Darby's still out six in the secondary its first and goal Louis big hole playing with the Blanc at the guard and he corkscrews his way to the flea Luis with a gain of 10 on the heels of the 13 yard run moments ago you challenge with the back leg Louis Kevin is that sometimes you lose it behind that big offensive line he's only five foot eight hundred ninety five pounds it's hard to find them Michael Williams tight end will be the fullback forth ones here the two tight ends bottom of his screen there's a third going wide Chandler for them in their second goal of the free Brady through the hands of Chandler and the coverage I'm a play by an employer well that's what you want you've got Aaron Williams who's six foot tall then you've got Chandler is six foot seven lady now has a third and three and on his drive on third and six here on koshkin third one he abducts him all over the place forever same phonation we just saw same shift once is in the backfield chandler bob would trust and the coverage continues and again it is here in Williams out of Texas same exact formation same shift same play except previous play Chandler runs to slant now he comes right back with the fade route and Aaron Williams doesn't have any of it he's able to get that right hand in there rip it out they will go for three 21 yard field goal try by Stephen Gostkowski late in the first half he had a 46 yarder it's the opening drive of the second half it's 27 32 New England about five minutes gone in the third quarter never miss a moment a football action with the CBS Sports after every play every story and every highlight right as they happen download the CBS sports app now call the Buffalo defense held the Patriots to three instead of six and it's huge now you get yourself a to score game and it does when you're struggling a little bit on out fence big play a big return in the kicking game can get you right back in and they've got a guy back there and Percy Harvin that can score any time he touches the ball problem is he has to get a chance on these kickoffs castouts um Kitson out of the back of the end zone every time they all seem to and moving the ball to the 35 too easy for these guys retool Buffalo team Kyle Orton was a quarterback last year for most of the seasons but Jackson is gone CJ spiller gone is the kick off by disgust returnable Harvin of the replacements from the two acceleration and the tackles and he's brought down by Watson Dakota Watson signed this week brings him down 20yard return here comes Tyrod Taylor's famous wings being prepared Tyrod Taylor is thought a touchdown pass he's thrown to pitch and he begins to the New England field goal at his own 22 with the 1st and 10 to fake the McCoy then on the sideline flag is thrown Malcolm Butler was down there defending Sammy Watkins I pick out a Clemson a year ago Watkins is even able make the catch on the boundary he's got a hit on well Malcolm Butler's in coverage it's watch Watkins there I don't really see much he just wait I think part of what happens is the corner falls down and slides down and such as happens so quickly that they think that thought that Watkins really pushed him I think that's a no call as in see the frustrations on Rex Ryan you know grocery a rookie is on the defensive line first in twenty five in the Patriots secondary the block by word this Center lies a bit of time there's another flag it was caught by McCoy he's at the 1970 our dick up just to keep checking the ball down getting the passing game to LeSean McCoy in the backs and a difficult time throwing the ball down the field this is on Buffalo and scott edwards a number three our side judge who's not the deal nothing like that well that's big that's either on Rex or someone on his staff last week there were chant we want Tom Brady now they're chanting something else second and 22 the poor kid hole on the move and from behind written down by Jimmy Collins some breathing space for Taylor in the offense up to the 27 19 yard burst by and LeSean McCoy will just keep an eye on the right side of this offensive line is this gonna collapse the left side of that defensive line of the Patriots Neela sean mccoy he's already up on the second level the job caved in and let's add that defensive line taylor surveys I'm sure there's a birthday with Tom Brady third down and four blocked by playing time for Taylor and he's got the first down Charles crawl in front of Tevin the 47 yard pickup to the 35 in approach down but I think when you're struggling a little bit in the passing game your best friend could be the tight end and they went out and got Charles credit paid him a king's ransom his Rick's told us and he's a guy that it gives them the ability now to attack in the middle of the field but you've got the speed on the outside with Harvin and Watkins and now you've got a tight end it can do the same thing in the middle you say he can walk to first in ten McCoy see Linda brings them down but the game of the yard another flag this looks like it's against Buffalo he had a couple holding penalties lastly against the Colts let's go to coach and James in New York a confidence builder to the quarterback yeah Ron now seven yards off Gareth Graham he was 7 to 7 for 56 yards on the drive as a Houston Texans tie up the Carolina Panthers 10 to 10 and I'm sure which Gannon knows how important that is back to Kevin Harlan you know that James he does lead out of Houston last week watching Kansas City beat the Texans first and 20 going deep he's looking for Harvin and the coverage from McCourty and from Terrell brown it is second and 20 well this is what Percy Harvin does he's got great straight line speed and see Terrell brown they're in pretty good position he knows he's got help over the top from his safety Devin McCourty it's some pretty good offensive coordinators while he was backing up Flacco and Baltimore did he really did he had a lot of them Kevin first first Cam Cameron and of course Jim Caldwell Gary Kubiak last year a number of different coordinators he actually three in the last four years it's not easy when it constantly asking new system set up the screen McCoy on second down in 20 years Hightower with a nice move right beard dousing the oncoming gruesome the wheels is whitey to the 35 and picks up ten and he's down a hundred percent we began the broadcast today tell you that he suffered a hamstring and preseason game number one didn't play the rest of the summer and he's still getting his legs under a mini which they really is I think it looks pretty good to me kids look pretty good at Friday at practice they surprise you so much talk about whether or not he would play but he also has a great feel for the passing game it's one of the things he does really well is very patient especially in the screen game at the 39 right here Tyrod Taylor underneath the Robert works with his first catch of the second half most out of bounds right there by Devin McCourty it is a gain of three where there's been a lot of talking after the place these are two teams that don't really care for one another there's Edelman there's a breeze with the punter Colton Schmidt listen Sanborn is a long stem the settlement up into that plate western New York sky looks hands I'm a four six and covered well as job by Duke Williams two yard return 48 yard punt here comes Brady and the Patriots mid third quarter let's laugh Street that defense dictated again against the Colts not today Kevin really this is the opposite I mean the Patriots are really controlled the line of scrimmage and and they are dictating right now how this game is played offensively to the buffalo punt from the 17 John Brady first and Jana for an optimize the middle linebacker Grady gentlemen may have heard the footsteps of Jerry Hughes incomplete well that's on Tom Brady we got to see out in front of throws you can't run Julian Edelman into a headon collision that sounds tough I mean to just sitting the receivers one thing well he's got to feel that the backside defensive end drop and Julian Edelman he's he's our good buddy but you don't want them into those headon cases they can't take that shot to the head second down ten he destroys it at the feet like you told us he won't last night at the feet of Louis pressure was there by Williams and others flag is drawn he said I just thought right to the feet of my receivers when their pressure is too strong twelve buffalo penalties they had eleven last week against the Colts Ronald Darby he's gonna grab Julian Edelman right there and we had an interesting conversation with Aaron Williams and safety he said you know he said a talented young player but he doesn't want to ask for help and he say he was trying to tell him it's okay to ask for help you know he asked for help against Edelman or a Brady but you need him we'll give it to you that you have to ask another way thought my back at the right tackle came in this series it injured his finger earlier on question ten Amendola and program lectures up with them it's a game of three and he was up to the 25 and they talked about the challenge that gone up against the Rex Ryan coach defense and the importance of identification and communication because he gives you so many different looks and so many exotic looks and pressures and he's just simply can't to care for mall during the course of the week to practice Bella Jets the best thing they do is mix it up second and seven down field he's got Thompson with the dive he jumps back up takes it to the 49 bells it on the play by Mario Butler it's a 24 yard strike a patriot first down and it starts up front with clean protection and nice pocket for Tom Brady to step up into and he just throws a bullet right down the middle of the field to Aaron Dobson you're the first and ten here to VR Dobson now four catches to your ticket and it gets into the floor territory to the 49 dee Ann Lewis and I'm really not surprised given we haven't seen a lot of their big running back once the Garrett lon this is not that kind of game there's any shutting down and eight former the block at the right tackle and that's caught by Gronkowski written out of bounds that koi gram takes it deeper into Buffalo territory 15yard catchin run to the 34 he just runs routes like a wide receiver look up get up on the safety nice clean break outside friendly working right down the line and making an easy throw for Brady I catches 82 yards ladies got over 300 through the air he's got a first in ten Dion Lewis is thrilled after a 1yard mean double dare mario williams off that line here's the Buffalo Bills have spent 250 million dollars on that defense of one longterm contract big signing bonuses well it's a strength in their units that the offensive line three members were selected to the Pro Bowl the last the last season for the second straight year for good reason and he's a really good group as you spice it didn't get a lot of money tied up in that in that defensive line Harrington is in there now he's part of that as he comes back to Buffalo sucking down a nine I'm Kowski backyard offers four o'clock at his pot by Dobson he was working on the kill Roby picks up 12 on second down and nine another New England first out when you see the different hand signals from Brady's he does a lot he takes care of the protection he signaled the receivers the adjustments he's nice have a big receiver Dobson six foot three got it to make those catches in the middle of field then pointing out the mic the linebackers all quarterbacks do it dictates the walking up front first and ten waiting dropped by Thompson walk me through that rich when a quarter why does he always pick that guy instead of saying where the safety is for in so what's a good that's a good point Kent so he's got five I'll fence alignment so you make a Mike declaration you're essentially you're saying we're gonna block the four big guys along the line and we're gonna block this particular player to build a field now it tells the running back to my right or my left who he's blocking it also tells the receiver on the other side of the slot who he's responsible they bring somebody off the edge so resets the protection when you make that call second ten good explanation Edelman and he dives to the pylon Conant touchdown 22 yard touchdown pass Brady to Edelman well you see all the action away and Julian Edelman he comes out he's just under control and then all of a sudden he turns on another gear and God has had a tough day Kevin Aaron Williams he had a couple penalties in the first half and he's not able to catch up and make the play on Edelman and then look at Aaron Williams Brady threw four touchdown passes opening night against the Steeler D and he's taken a top ten defense today and thrown three touchdown passes with a beautiful scoring drive of 83 yards Dobson caught passes of 24 and 12 Gronkowski for 15 and Edelman to the pylon that's a good shot there it's a great shot hidef they never faced a third down on that drive which started back at the 17 and as they take a look at Aaron Williams we will step aside 324 in the third I'm Brady just threw a touchdown pass of 22 yards to Edelman who dough for the pylon and in the midst of that ploy Aaron Williams the defensive back who is down on his back and a ambulance has just been taken out of the field and it's not a good sign but the precautionary tenor of the NFL now has never been stronger let's watch it again that was the play it was hard to tell it is Edelman's legs kind of whipped up in autumn beneath the belt but I'm not sure a little Fassett right armor yeah I don't know kind of came down on it funny and well they had filled the RV parking lot here so early in the week and if we're selling tickets for some of the highest prices they had seen four regular season game the place was full day at the Guinness Book of World Record person here to measure the sound is to try to break the arrowhead stadium Kansas City alltime mark and the play of the Patriots has been surgical and couple turnovers by buffalo Brady has been terrific with his three touchdowns in 340 yards and now the injury to a starter Aaron Williams taking a little bit of the air out of the building it really is and you know it's interesting Kevin we talked to Aaron Williams on Friday and I said what's the best way to approach Brady and said the key doesn't be perfect the slightest mistake and he'll make you pay for it and I think we've seen that a lot today from from the Patriots second there they've been close but not close enough and he just needs a small window and you look at Brady's drop back to past forty three times today he's only been sacked once this is supposedly the best defensive line in football but been a frustrating day for the big guys up front because Brady's been getting the ball out so quickly they are assisting Aaron Williams who was covering Edelman on that touchdown catch and dive for six we talked to Richard said we talked to Aaron on Friday at the Bills facility and you say you know when they hired Rex Ryan the first thing he did was get on the phone and call a lot of players that had played for Rex he said they were gushing with praise and said you're never gonna play for a better coach and Aaron told us he said what I saw in training camp what I've seen through one game he's been everything and more as advertised yeah look this is this is gonna be a good football team I think Rex will get things turned around here and it's all like they're starting over on defense either they had the fourth ranked defense last June they led the league in sacks and you know if you know anything about Rex Ryan he's made a living out of making life difficult on quarterbacks hasn't been the case today but the room wasn't built in a day it's gonna take a while I think they've got a young quarterback Kevin if they're excited about the big challenge for them I think offensively you know they've had 15 different starting quarterbacks since Jim Kelly I think in order to get this thing turned around they need a longterm answer at quarterback and if they're hoping it's Tyrod Taylor well think about this Taylor starts today the 11th different quarterback to start for the bills against Brady as they put Aaron Williams on the stretcher Rob Johnson Alex Van Pelt Drew Bledsoe VP Austin Kelly Holcomb Trent Edwards Ryan Fitzpatrick EJ Manuel Kyle Orton Thaddeus Lewis castle the other day and although technically he was the starter in that first game against in fact Castle warming up right now on the sidelines what that means is anybody's guess well I think he's warming up Seiler yep and that castle is a good guy to have Kevin for for Tyrod Taylor in fact uh Rex wrong let Ryan in great role wholesale commensal has been in there the former Patriot quarterback has been invaluable they cut him and then resigned him before the first game so the decision wasn't easy I mean I think all three quarterbacks Tyrod Taylor Matt Cassel and EJ Manuel played well in the preseason and I think they just felt like Tyrod Taylor was the best of all three and they felt maybe had the most upside at this point in his career but you know I think castles a veteran guys an unselfish player that can really help the young quarterback and EJ Manuel you know it's kind of been a a disappointing start to his career here in Buffalo he's the 1st round pick back in 3 years ago and then we saw him play quite a bit his first two years but just kind of an upanddown inconsistent performer for the bills and really open it up this offseason by you're bringing in casts on making the decision to sign Tyrod Taylor and free agency in there is a great deal of care in that picture just spoke event that they are taking with Aaron Williams defensive back and go probably go immediately to a hospital though every Stadium in the National Football League equipped with a trauma area for xrays and advanced medical help but as they've strapped him in they may take him immediately to a nearby hospital and we really serve word whatever you receive the message we will give it off to you and tell you what has happened lied on the plate Rex Ryan it's a shame to lose a starter like that Lux is gonna call his team together gather them talk to him on the sidelines as they well you know character their emotion they may not win this game I mean obviously they're down 33 13 with 324 in the third quarter but how they gonna finish the game I think that's important what kind of message are they gonna send to the fans here in Buffalo and ruling the Patriots and rest the team teams that watch this film on Monday are we gonna come out we're gonna finish strong here in the fourth quarter are we gonna be a physical football team we're gonna clean up some of the mistakes we made earlier in the game and I offensively what can we do here now this is a this is a great teaching moment I think for this football team it's always important to finish strong in the fourth quarter and carry some of that momentum some of that confidence into next week as you saw a short prayer by those on the sidelines for the Buffalo Bills is a fallen teammate Aaron Williams has been put in the ambulance which is now just beginning to pull away so we will update his situation as quickly as we can this fanbase this holded the most seasoned tickets they have sold in over two decades that's the kind of excitement that Rex Ryan's generating here and the anticipation for this game heading in was just off the charts you know there's not an empty seat here and nope they've been out there tailgating it seems like all week this is a faithful crowd here in western New York they love their football team and I think they're excited about what Rex Ryan brings to the mix he brings energy he brings excitement he brings passion certainly brings confidence to a team that I think needs some of it Kevin this is a team that it's kind of lost its way once proud organization hasn't made the playoffs in 15 seasons this is the extra point following the 22 yard touchdown pass Brady to Edelman Edelman has caught two touchdown passes today and Scouse key puts it through and 324 to play in the third 34134 reigning Super Bowl champions on top on CBS while the Patriots coming off their fourth World Championship in the last 14 years let's go back to the first one Super Bowl 36 Patriots and Rams met in Super Bowl 36 in the dome in New Orleans Brady thrown 445 on a touchdown David Patten with the score tied at 17 Adam Vinatieri the oldest player now in the NFL he picked the 48yard field goal as time expired it was the first of a four for the New England Patriots and of course Super Bowl 50 will be in Santa Clara the south of San Francisco and that's the challenge for Bella Trek and Brady and the New England organization tough to repeat the N head went for a long time rich last time the team repeated was New England you know I always say it's hard to handle success but I don't know that is it a team in football that's that's that's better than in terms of handling success I think coach Belichick is a great job helping his team to refocus and eliminate and distractions here as good as any organization in football terms of eliminating the distractions welsh Kowski kicks it over Harvin's head weekend starts with Kirk Cousins and the Redskins battling rival Eli Manning and the Giants it's all here on Thursday Night Football on CBS and NFL Network is interesting talking to coach Belichick about if you're gonna say what happened the Giants Cowboys game on Sunday night he steps a great teaching opportunity great teaching moment went back and watched X that sequence with the quarterbacks and the offensive coaches make sure everybody's on the same page tell knocked away and just about grant Alan branch who started for the bills in 2013 97 he's watched the ball away recovered by Buffalo it is a sack it's a loss of five Shearer jumped on the loose ball and the bill branch is working inside on the rookie right guard John Miller knocked that ball out of the hand of Tyrod Taylor I've been down 15 repetition another loose bolts vacuumed in by the sean mccoy and he'll rumble up the head before he's brought down by and Logan Ryan takes it to the 21 yard longer the bills it's amazing they don't even block Jamie Collins I mean this is what the third time now he's run right through the a gap between the center and garden don't even block them and call it cool third down and nine six in the Patriots secondary then the plot now they break through James breaks through and brings him down with another New England sack Chandler Joanie's brings him down dousing in at the 10 and the funny unit comes on we'll have a lot of sex today by New England seven of them will having a difficult time up front given ins Chandler Jones is just he's done a nice job changing things up on the left tackle corny glamour at times he's beat him around the edge at times he's dumped underneath and that time he just bullrushes him right back into the feet of tie rod Taylor here's another fun for a secondyear Colton Schmidt years with the Wynn Amendola on the run 45 yard line ruined the ROM making his way and leaping near the Buffalo's hoodie with a 16 yard return on a 45yard punt and a flagon boobie Dixon was slow to get up on the special teams for the Bill Brady today well I got a kick out of what Rex had to say about Brady last night mostly active quarterback no leg makes wide receivers look really good he's hard to rattle he's got a terrific command of the offense and they felt like they'd have to mix it up and he can't give him a steady diet I'll pick you apart but just seems like whatever Buffalo is tried defensively the Brady's had an answer for it 27 of 42 three touchdowns he's picking up right where he left off in week 1 against the Steelers mawkish kin and not going to play the left tackle it in solders plays Walmer as I mentioned before even with the injured finger back in their first content they'll just have to sit on the menu they do Lewis offers a block they go outside Edelman was covered by Darby what that mean when he was tapping them on the back hey what are you thinking about tonight we beat these guys do you think no I mean since you know it's just another way to remind the center I mean just tap it in and tell them hey everyone sitting in be changed to play the unciekin down in ten Gronkowski Dustin Brown rides him down near the 30 warning Gronkowski continues to put a dent in every defense she plays 23 yard catchin run pushed out about South simple but you really have to tackle well against a guy like Gronk and no one had more yards after contact last season and then Rob Gronkowski his run after the kill catch abilities tremendous and it's not an easy guy to bring down when you look at his size and his length his ability to put that free arm out and give you a stiff arm 13:5 who's eating yours today for Gronkowski first inten Brady time to go deep those short underneath an ability get it with the coverage on the plane by Derby we just got the preliminary word on Aaron Williams neck injury obviously won't return and we are waiting for the news on him he's gonna turn no player has had more touchdown receptions since 2010 than Rob Gronkowski 57 we used to perform front passing kick in this building as he was growing up as a 13 year old he is involving punt pass and kick here and Wilson look at the middle of field it's wide open second down 10 incomplete again great he doesn't see anything and Brandon was applying terrific pressure up the middle for the Buffalo defense he throws to the feet of his receivers as he did then third and 10 and talked about in an aggressive approach defensive earlier what a display the bill the field it's wide open and here's Gronk right here I don't know if Brady just ran out of time but the play clock of course he's got a free rusher in his face toque Williams has taken the place of Aaron Williams go downtown underneath through the hands of Luis in complete coverage on the plan to find Gilmour and the fieldgoal unit takes the field for the New England Patriots late in the third gives head field off today of 46 and 22 yards 23 our catch on fire Gronkowski gives in this good field position a 50 yard try by Gus Kowski as Kowski and that is good from 50 yards away leaders 37:13 with the Patriots in 28 seconds to play in the third quarter but snap good hold and good kick from gust ASCII is one of the better ones in the business Canada not just in terms of what he does with his keep with his extra points and bill goals but his ability to kick the ball deep there's another guy that been a terrific day Rob Gronkowski six catches 105 yards really got a start of this big one in the first quarter for 36 yards a touchdown and it tried everything they put linebackers on them they put safeties they put corners they tried to bracket in playing in an insideout highlow we use call 57 touchdown passes from Tom Brady yeah I mean that's a lot and you know I think that there's so much talk this week in western New York about how to handle 87 right I know there's any one way but I think you make a huge mistake when he's outside the numbers and you leave them oneonone coverage Scouse can get in the workout and that's out of the end zone once again to the 20 yard line for the Buffalo Bills in their quarterback Tyrod Taylor only one more day until the biggest premiere in the universe you won't want to miss the first new episode of the season the Big Bang Theory on its new night tomorrow at 8:00 7:00 central right here on CBS Carlos Williams is the running back an open competition in training camp for the quarterback job castle EJ Manuel and miss our tailor who won it here's the rush you've got a hand on him Carlos Williams comes up with his bangs his way into cheong taken down by Butler picks up 11 and on first down for the billows where Taylor hasn't had a lot of time Kevin to throw the football and even when he does get it out he's been getting hit not the biggest guy takes courage to sit back there in the pocket gets it off before the end of the third Carlos Williams who played safety then switched to run abandoned Florida State it's up for on first down and knock down a play let's go to the fourth in Buffalo we begin the fourth quarter Tom Brady has thrown three touchdown passes almost written 50 yards second down four with the run Carlos Williams takes it for seven into the teeth of that defense they get the first down up to the 45 yard line of the bills and given the Patriots defense it's really played well I look at my stat monitor I don't even know if it's right this hit Taylor's dropped back 22 times he's already been sacked seven a really good job of course a big part of that and Jamie Collins coming off the edge first and ten here a million they got him high tower and then coming through Malcolm Brown the first round pick out of Texas eight sack right there and also see Linga was involved in the play and look at that the crowd in the line of scrimmage and get the pressure it up inside a good pass russ has push up inside and speed off the edge Hightower you see him break loose and they're just going after Tyrod Taylor with a second down and 17 right now for Taiwan taylor percy harvin in space and on the move and that's the 45 to the 42 of the New England Patriots 20 yard catch and run first down Buffalo well last week they built an early lead here in Buffalo now we're gonna find out about Tyrod Taylor Kevin can he bring his team from behind especially when they need him to throw it more than the 19 attempts he had last week Christian 10 Taylor high uncatchable the cross there for clay also saw Watkins in the background they were in the area second down and 10 Tyrod Taylor you mentioned this at the beginning of the broadcast he was a backup to Joe Flacco for four years so that meant that he could sit and watch and learn yeah he's really was considered a developmental project come out of Virginia Tech a six round pick they said he lacked that the desired measurable Jim like at that position he's not the tallest guy but he's very athletic and well born we saw last week he can make plays under duress McCoy big events with a game of five and McCoy the work his way to the 38 with some pushing after the play that bears hip little conversation with Hogan that twenty nine Dropbox has been sacked eight times they've not played well up front the rookie John Miller has had his struggles forty glam he talked about that Kevin the left tackle position he's had his struggles it's a medical third down in five would the center with the block but here they come once again and Taylor tries to leap through their coverage finds a hot shower got him close to a first down with a 33 yard line up New England the other thing the Patriots have done a nice job is really keeping the lid on Tyrod Taylor with the scramble yeah and then he had the big one in the first the first drive a 23 yard scramble other than that Matt patrician his guys have done a great job getting up field setting the edge and doing a good job with a corn all coordinated pass rush around Taylor fourth and one will step aside Buffalo and New England Patriots take the time out right there leading 3713 they're gonna go for it 1216 to play in the fourth trailing 3713 we've just gotten more word on Aaron Williams he has been taken to a local hospital then we'll continue to feed you information as we get it fourth and one and I'm here Carlos Williams corkscrews his ways off first down the brought down by mega bitch picks up two on fourth and one movin to the 32 of the New England Patriots on a first down for the bills remote tackle there by Jamie Collins got all in the field today Kevin two and a half sacks Chandler Jones with three sacks the treants have 21 new players mix and their Super Bowl team of a year ago turning over that roster first attempt to a lot of congestion cilinders half turn against that he'll talk for a touchdown Robert Ward's covered by McCrory 32 yard strike well this is what concern jiff Tyrod Taylor getting outside the pocket extending plays with his legs and then thrown the ball back across the field and look at the Hopkins Butler he was right there to make the play just kind of overruns it Robert Woods is able to slip in behind and make the grab trying for two so Taylor today 19 to 20 557 through the air two touchdowns two picks one was late in the first half one interception wise they tried for two with 1142 to play in the fourth tailor shop in complete coverage on the play by Malcolm button so it stays 3719 32yard toss Taylor Robin woods I pick out a USC three years ago and the bills continue to try to chip away at that going good lead Tyrod Taylor is just a 32yard touchdown pass to Robert woods 37:19 as our score and the kickoff from Jordan game everybody up front therefore the patriots are a good portion of them see what buffalo does here kick away Devin McCourty will let this go out of the engine it's the 20 yard line it will be first in Jen rich when you were in these situations sizable lead on the road division rival knowing they just scored but it's in the mind of a quarterback here with what has happened today and what may have for the rest of the world oh I think you're Tom Brady you don't want to take your foot off the gas Gavin you're playing well I think at some point you know you'll begin to run the football a little bit more effectively but look they're gonna have a tough time running the football against this bills front seven and that's a big reason why we haven't seen LeGarrette one it's not that kind of game gotta spread these guys out and make the playing space and that's what patron the Patriots a Brady down so the back into the one tackle that's incomplete thrown advantage right now ski there is a lot of congestion around him it was interesting to watch Brittany operate against Pittsburgh in than watching today everything that has happened to him and circled around him in the offseason his ability to focus on refocus on the upcoming season where I think it's there as an organization their ability to handle distractions I think they do that as well as anyone Kevin I talked about it who's that nicely in the pocket and finds his receiver near the 34 it's caught by Dobson he's at a big day 14 yard pick the better to push down we talked about if you want to lose have a distraction and not deal with it or handle it because it'll linger if you have to deal with them quickly and effectively and you get the sense and that's what they did with this whole deflategate thing that was written it was written about it was within days of AFC championship game I think the Patriots put it behind him isten 15 Brady's getting tall in the pocket he's got Dion Lewis across the middle he's drilled right there by Rambo 16 yard catch up to midfield another first down boy he's a tough guy because there was a big big hit and by the safety Pocari Rambo sometimes you don't need to see hit you can just hear it grounders one who wrote him down that was one of them we felt it up here goes to jack the other side now is got Chandler performer bill to the 45 brought down by darbian it's up five yards in what a luxury to have big tight ends I mean you've got ground crew six foot six they go out and get Scott Chandler he's six foot seven and just throw it in there area they've got a really good chance of coming down with it seven on five pretty three touchdown passes today 399 in his career wafting one here like every woman and he's got him near the 25 Gilmore was in the vicinity that Edelman was wide open it's a tension a good one for 22 yards with a flag thrown on the play call pick on the Patriots against the back dachshund with Dobson's outside you'll see him work inside and then we're gonna call that every time you can you can't stop them extend your hands Dion Lewis is back in please wife put the tight ends on the near side second down and 15 seven in the secondary Buffalo Grady Edelman and brought down by McElroy B with a gain of five to the forty eight to New York and James Brown Camden having his way coats a second touchdown pass today this one to Corey Brown he's 36 yards I pretty much seals the victory for the Carolina Panthers you ran for a touchdown as well as they leave 24 to 10 and eight minutes to go back to Kevin Hollander Rich Gannon we should enrich to go to om to so I'm never a good thing when you replace your starting quarterback in week one Kevin could be a long season for the Texans now at the former Patriot quarterback started third and nine Brady's thought his receiver again this time the running back it's Luis hit by Rambo shy of the 40yard line very close to a first down and this is what's given Rex Ryan's defense pits over the years small packs that can play on the line of scrimmage in the slot out wide this hope this game is all about matchups and beyond Lewis Rob Gronkowski Julian Edelman these are tough matchups for the Buffalo Bills Shaq Mason is coming as the fullback the derrick one is about ahem forth and warning by the way Mason came in and declared himself ineligible to the fullback position yep timeout taken 816 fourth quarter all Patriots Tom Brady is those were 14 13 yards and three touchdowns he's on the move late in the fourth wait in this game at the 41 a buffalo Belichick has decided to put his offense out there on fourth and one Mason will be a fullback not quite sure where to go one is the tailback that they is oh you've got him Brady's going deep he's looking for another and just over shoots him with the coverage on the play by Gilmore and I'm down Brandi holding his head he knew it already yeah look at that well they got they got just what they wanted they packed him in and now they sent drop down the middle of a field and joy Hetal that he had either one he just overthrows Edelman to throw the Tom Brady didn't love to head back look at Johnny Adam got in ia was so important for him in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl xlix who caught the four passes for 54 yards in a touchdown England beat Seattle Liston 10 on downs of coaches McCoy leaving stings Irving puck down finally on the play by Jenny Collins nice run of 13 the man during McCoy takes it down to the 47 yard line in New England it looks pretty good for a guy with a bad hammy hey does Kevin it looks pretty good Taylor first intent the sidelines he'll work here is got harvest retton's on the Terrell brown with the gain of five and he's down flag is down to the 41 yard line of the Patriots they're been 11 penalties on the Patriots today now 13 on the Buffalo Bills right tackle Shawn Tyrell head Ruth Henderson so bring it first in 20 sloppy all right Kevin 13 penalties immune system not going to beat a team like the Patriots doing that no further word on Anand Williams we just told you the update on the defensive back heard earlier in the game neck injury here comes McCoy on first in 20 charges right up the middle to the 49 of Buffalo Dan Williams was taken to a local hospital it appeared to be very serious obviously anytime an ambulance comes out on the field and puts you on the stretcher and make you in mobile that is enough we're concerned but very precautionary to the way these medics handle that second 14 and it's what confined to the defensive much in Jonas he's down to the 41 in New England with the gain of 10 we will update him when we get more information on Aaron Williams the injury defensive back started for the Buffalo Bills the Patriots play know a lot more conservative with their shell on the back end just put a little bit more off coverage trying to keep everything in front of them play the nickel here five and a secondary third down in four for Buffalo Tyrod Taylor undred and 67 through the air two touchdowns and two picks those Rufus Johnson there goes Tyrod Taylor spikes for the first time he's got a late hit they say on Collins after the run of five for the first that's not easy to pull off Kevin you're trying to make a play into last second the quarterback slides the rules are the rules and that's tough spot to be in a few jeanne Collins the officials are talking about it get a good look yet if they're doesn't hit him in the head means the right call you only think it's the right call I mean he's trying to make a play it's not like he goes in hi and tries that forearm to the head though these rules when I played you can hit him it's step one you can kick them out to the play no problem he broken up man wailing sir there's a swap Tonya first and ten Taylor look at the footwork foundation with negatives are they gone Arvind and put behind backed away by Fletcher's but not gonna bounce that tryin told us yesterday said the Patriots study tape of how to knock the ball away strip the ball away from opposing carriers there's a flag on the play too is that they studied more than maybe any other team in the league and they work on it they work on it every day in practice they work on Paul extraction the secret Tyrod Taylor throw the ball to Percy Harvin I'll keep an eye the back of your screen there and Bradley Fletcher he comes in and pokes it out Harvin may have been cutting that ball a little bit loosely and that Patricia makes this guy's study that tape sees who and who doesn't they've got a scouting report on every player in terms of how high they handle the ball and handle it loosely first and 10 McCoy he runs on a real estate now that finished in 10 he runs for four he takes it down to the Patriot six I've been impressed with will sean mccoy after the guy i think he's really gonna help them not just in terms of the running game with the passing game and even Tyrod Taylor he made it he's made some mistakes but it's 21 to 27 he's thrown a couple touchdowns and he is his elusiveness his ability to extend plays he's gonna be an exciting quarterback to watch this season in the AFC East McCoy 15 carries 89 yards 27 receiving yards today second down six timeout they've got two left we have I've and I have to go on the fourth they burned a couple timeouts in the first half last week some confusion you see Tyrod Taylor and look at his place sheet there and that left that left wrist well coming up the subway postgame show is being put together for you right now in New York 4gb Tony Romo and coach Cowen scores news and highlights that's all coming up on the subway postgame report you use the term build a bully that's what Lex wants to do it's going to take some time as you can see but I still think if this one carries out the way it is this is an optimistic fan base and an optimistic organization about where they're pointing yeah I mean I think it's certainly they're trending in the right direction they've got a really good defense that hasn't played as well today but Tom Brady D Evans made a lot of good defenses look looks silly you get a score here you go sir you can make this a ten point ten eighteen point game now second down and six interrogate a consent Partizan number he gets into the endzone Buffalo Bills touchdown on the quarterback draw seven yard touchdown run look at that this is what you want to do if you're talented quarterback is a great runner designed quarterback draw Taylor has thrown for two touchdowns he's had a touchdown run himself horse Williams the rookie running back is it a touchdown on in the first drive of the game where they went 80 yards licketysplit flying for two years market sweep read beautifully by McCourty so again they fail on getting to and it stays 37 with the mr. point conversion here I've attended at 37:25 during Lindley before the villas have got a sevenyard touchdown run by the quarterback Tyrod Taylor who continues to look with Greg Norman and some of the pictures taken from upstairs Jordan game will kick off he has never succeeded on an onside kick carpenter on the other end is to a four in his career the flag is thrown did not go the mandatory 10 yards with a lot of penalties today my goodness most ever and this rivalry between the bills and on a chore yeah between the two teams 13 for Buffalo and 11 for the Patriots 119 yards and penalties for the Patriots coach Belichick won't be pleased with that and nor will coach Ryan 118 yards and penalties and those are just the accepted penalties Canon Bank at the right tackle for New England on to the face legal blog before the ball went ten yards by the kicking team that also defied up number three kick off out of bounds that penalty will be accepted the ball will be belong to New England that time we came out and took a look at your keys or the second and let's see how they have developed her or not developed well I thought it was important for the Patriots out fence game to keep attacking and they kept pouring on the gas I offensively and defensively no explosive plays nice job containing Tyrod Taylor for the most part and I think you look at offensively they didn't abandon the running game but it wasn't as effective and of course the biggest I think the biggest disappointment today for Buffalo just the one sack to Brady that Brady dropped back 54 times here in Buffalo and he's only sacked once that's a problem Brady on first and ten Gronkowski hit by Manny Lawson knocked down by Brown 35 yard line of Buffalo it is a gain of eight as he closes in on touchdown pass number 403 today what an accomplishment I think you look at the sack differential given the Patriots eight sacks today and the Buffalo Bills with three Pro Bowlers along that defensive line just a single sack and then credit the offensive line for the Patriots that read that guy right there we're sorting through all the traffic and the communication and the identification and getting the ball out not taking sense lady with a second down and ten knocked away knocked away by Hughes and picked up by Gaius loose still and recovered by Crown Freston Brown vacuums in in a midfield second Patriot turnover today Ruffalo will get it and midfield with two timeouts well that's where the pressure come comes from you see Jerry Hughes these mats tough on him so Lee tries to cut them and he doesn't go to the ground Tom Brady never feels the defensive end come off the edge so Taylor in the offense out there looking into the Nick will be Tyrod Taylor last possession 7 yard touchdown run possession before that touchdown cast Awards moves up and as his receiver water heads down the swingline he goes to the New England Patriot 25 with a 25yard catch and Romney Wow check out sir Tyrod Taylor his ability to move around in the pocket feel the rush slide we set himself keep his eyes down the field keep the ball in a throwing position I mean this is what he does so well making plays on the move outside the pocket keeps his eyes downfield first and ten going deep he flipped it through walk kiddies touchdown boy Tyrod Taylor and the Buffalo Bills an offense really showing some fight here Kevin in the fourth quarter and a really nice released by Sammy Watkins he goes right right by Bradley Fletcher we talked about the struggles he had last year in Philadelphia until he gets them both down now the extra point bills are missed three today a kickin to two point tribes for one and it is good from Dan confident it's a fivepoint game with 416 to play three consecutive scores by the Buffalo Bills a touchdown pass to woods of 32 a touchdown run by the village quarterback Tyrod Taylor of seven and right there a 24 yard touchdown pass Taylor Sammy Watkins there now things are getting interesting as this crowd comes to life Kevin and bulk load this down by five with two timeouts to go now they can kick the ball down the field to play some defense get the ball back for the offense that's come to life here late in the fourth quarter then the bills with three missed extra points of kick in two point two two point rise you can add that up and see what would take you on that score the bills last three tribes ten play ATR drive seven play 59yard touchdown drive and two plays in a 50yard touchdown and a fumble by Brady gave him great position at the 50 and they cash in and now this crowd is alive is rich standing back in it clip in swing kickoff from Jordan game Louis's back we'll leave it in the end zone touch that one tea it's amazing how quickly things can change in this business game you and I are just talking 10 minutes ago about the little Patriots going to do with this big lead and said maybe bring in LeGarrette Blount start taking the air out of the football star trying that now is sudden we're the fist fight here 37:32 of course 16 to go as I mentioned Buffalo still has two timeouts well Jackson is at the right guard they have a rookie right Boyd they have a lucky Center and quiet so let's go and then go gronkowski adoption of the lineouts it's question Jennifer Fitzroy cluck Edelman not in front of Darby Roby is there as well falling down six yard pickup he's up to the 26 yard line of New England they just go right to work through the air and whether a bowl today is gonna throw up the early downs but a quick short intermediate rows have been very effective against Rex Ryan's defense it's shutting down in four Boldin is in off with a black gentleman as it is right in front of Graham it's a six yard pickup it is a first down to the 32 of know England might have been the same exact play Kevin we saw on first down almost on the court across the formation and the quick throw gentleman subway post game show coming up JB Tony Parker Wang coached our scores highlights and news all next on the subway postgame show from our CBS Studios in New York Buffalo out of timeouts Patriots now pup whoops got one disappear there for a second one one we're in the timeout category with 324 to go on before Buffalo's defense can they've got a club with a stop the farmers in the secondary is a first in time for Brady the plot by s\u00f6lden looking for Dion Lewis coverage on the play by linebacker Nigel pranam and the flag is down well they tried to double move Nigel Bradham with Dianna Lewis he goes up the field he he stops and then he tries to go by see you at the end here Nigel Bradham never turns around and plays the ball or even finds it 22 yard penalty puts him at the 46 of the bills timeout apiece 319 to play getting the whole middle to field it's wide open bring Edelman in the block they're going to take a shot these locks and they go deep and he is looking what a catch made by a man told with Robi out of what a crab looking into that bright Sun Danny Amendola comes up with a terrific exking of twenty nine yards to the 17 what what an incredible craite catch in concentration by Danny Amendola question is whether that actually hits the ground as he's coming down but great concentration looking stretch out to make that play push catch today lady first antenna there's outside to Thompson who is met by Gilmore who makes the grand after a gain of six they'll put him at the eleven of the bills and a timeout Buffalo their last to 28 to play in the fourth so they got Edelman for a six and a four yard pass completion they have the 22 yard penalty and Amendola came up with a terrific 29 yard diving reception and on backtoback plays you get gonna give Josh McDaniel a lot of credit Kevin and in terms of his design they bring in great emotions in Joe and Edelman on the throat to Amendola and he blocks and unless last play they did the same thing with Rob Gronkowski Brady short motions have been he put he blocks the oneinch they doing a great job how are they handling the Blitz and the pressure by bringing in receivers in tight ends to block so Buffalo is out of timeouts watching here yeah he's gonna come all the way across and he winds up blocking on the back of the formation that gives pretty just enough time to make the throw down the field we got ramble at the blood in anand ola with a sensational catch it's second down and four at the bills 12 once it is in and a Whoopi offensive lineman Mason is the pullback race in the quad not much of one employment was tied up with like Kyle Williams at the bottom of the pile and there is no gain and the clock continues to tick the ball is it about the 12 I'll just run this down to the twominute warning at one time New England led by 24 points in this second half three consecutive scores for the bills but now out of timeouts trailing by five on CBS twominute warning twominute warning third and five for the New England Patriots leading by five Buffalo is out of timeouts the Bills have scored 19 on an insert fourthquarter points but Buffalo has missed three extra points a kick and twopoint conversions the big question here is do you on the football try and pick up the first down if you don't get it you kicked a field goal you still run plenty of time off the clock and you get the ball back up eight with the allow Brady to throw at one time once in the backfield third down and five Brady once and climbs his way down Neal the seven and very close to a first down that's the right call you look there on about 40 seconds off the clock you come in and kick the field going it's an eightpoint game you give the ball back to the bills after the kickoff with less than a minute to go see here comes the field going it on fourth down and today guess Kowski is nailed them from 50 21 and 46 the chains will come out for more accurate measurement as short as you can see now would you go for this or would you pick the fruit no you got to kick the three in this situation amount that's not even a discussion I mean you're up by five Kevin I think you just kick the field goal and you go up by eight and they can run they can run the clock here to about 116 117 if they so choose if you don't get it go for it hearing they don't get it you give them a chance for to get the ball back and we're able to score a touchdown they win the game as opposed to I'm having to score a touchdown and also convert a twopoint feel to for twopoint conversion the hole comes from the putter Ryan Alan Joe Cardona our rookie from Navy the long snapper 25yard field goal by Stephen Gostkowski no timeouts before he puts through another's he has kicked for today that from 25 and the lead is eight stopping a run of 19 unanswered fourth quarter points by the bills let's see if Tyrod Taylor's got any more magic left Kevin we've really made some big time throws here in the fourth quarter need a big return that's need a big return and it hasn't really had an opportunity because the stouts he's done a great job kicking the ball so deep in the back of the end zone or out of the end zone but if you can get a short kick and get and get the ball in the hands of Percy Harvin and maybe get it out around the 40 yard line they're that much closer and you can take some shots to the end zone Brady threw 59 times today as you can see Gronkowski overall good tailors look at 23 of 29day through the air last week there's 14 of 19 watkins who did not catch a pass last week has six with a touchdown reception today for the bills another great kick you'll be out of the end zone once again Harvin was back there so from the 20 and no timeouts and 1:15 left that is in front of Taiwan generally they just can't take a sack I mean you know throw the ball away not gonna hurt you in this situation you've got to be able to use the boundary severs got to be able to get out down and get out of bounds quickly and the offensive line in the event of a big completion down the field Kim they really have to hustle get up there and give Tyrod Taylor a chance to spike the ball seven defensive backs for the Northland Patriots Taylor with a first and ten the wind up and it's off the hands of Watkins and on the ricochet it's get accepted by New England and crab by Logan Lyon and that will seal the New England win well another high throw by Tyrod Taylor not an impossible kitchen but when you throw it high these things happen we saw it earlier in the first half a high throw in the direction of Charles clay is tight end got tipped and result in an interception and logan ryan in the right place at the right time makes a nice catch away from his body to to seal the victory Brady is thrown seven touchdown passes on the season no picks three interceptions thrown by Ron Taylor as they go to a knee Buffalo out of timeouts and the clock will tick off well I did such a great job last week Kevin not getting sacked and not turning the football over certainly not the case today he was sacked eight times and the three interceptions you just against a brady led team you just can't give this guy extra opportunities and certainly a learning experience for the young quarterback three turnovers for the bills eight sacks allowed 14 penalties three missed extra points Belichick and Ryan will meet the New England Patriots will go to 2 and our Buffalo Bills will even at one in one it is short and sweet not a lot said they're no good game there are two teammates from the past Castle along with Brady Rob Gronkowski over a hundred yards receiving today and Tom Brady for 466 through the air and three touchdown passes coming up next the Subway postgame show for Rich Gannon Kevin Harlan so long from Orchard Park New York you've

  "transcript": "well we'll be there if you love football Sunday I want an orchard park to be a great place to be Anette with Tom Brady last night he and the Patriots very ready for today under 10 miles an hour on the wind 64 degrees rich a beautiful day for football Tom Brady seemed very calm of course every time we talked to him he seems calm and uncontested in terms of his thoughts it is navigating any kind of game coming up well this isn't his first rodeo Kevin he's been to a lot of games like this is what you live for these if divisional games on the road meaningful games of course the Bills have a new coach and staff a new philosophy a new quarterback there's been a lot of talk come out of Buffalo this week these are the games that Tom Brady and his teammates get up for this is going to be a great one here in Buffalo back to flipping the coin the Patriots won the toss they have deferred for the bills his son back perfect he has come to this team perfect he has come to this team is 14 in four years and he thinks he has found a home in this Buffalo offense they'll use him all over the place Stephen Gostkowski has the ball teed up and he's on 35 foot Buffalo Bills beat the Colts here last week 27 to 14 but the bills rich have launched 26 of the last 29 to the Patriots it's a real crowd nothing because the first thing that Rex Ryan addressed and it got thrown this team way back in February Kevin that they've got to change the coach on the environment and starts with taking care of business against LePage Ivan's gonna leave it in the end zone touchdown to the 20 this takes us to the quarterback Tyrod Taylor who technically did not start a quarterback last week he ended up going wide on the first play castle was under center yeah but I really felt he handled himself well last week and I think we're all curious to see if he can build on last week's performance against better competition the crushing today for this offense for the bills what kind of production will they get out of McCoy who as we said is 900 percent and wide receiver Sammy Watkins who did not catch a pass last week well the 1st and 10 this is McCoy they jump on him his Selena making the stop after a gain of four this is their line Richie incognito grated the highest in fact is Rex Ryan's oldest Friday he was terrific he really protects that pocket inside we talked about LeSean McCoy he said numerous 1000 yard seasons came here in a trade with the Philadelphia Eagles second down and six that's trash play 85 years in motion former Miami Dolphins to the air ten and he can rhyme and he's got the first down getting a block from clay and then astronauto bombs by Collins a run rich of 23 yards they take it to the 47 a buffalo and this is what you have to be yet to be so disciplined get it and running you'll see the pressure but you have to be so disciplined with your rush lanes because all he needs is a little window a little gap and he's off to the races you have to set the edge force him to sit in the pocket and function as a pocket passer but you can't give him lanes to scramble laughs Leah Taylor took it nine times it ends that call he then to rush for 41 yards here's another first team Jam DISA with someone's picked out there LeSean McCoy into the secondary brought down by Terrell brown 15 yard pickup and a good block by the fullback Jerome felt think eviction familiar name on that line Chandler Jones on the other side branches to play for Buffalo Collins male and Dante Hightower on the outside secondary is different now there's the Super Bowl hero Malcom Butler on his Revis Faunus Robert Vaughn is Harrington 15yard run right there by McCoy and Felton the used to block for Adrian Peterson of Minnesota is the full back here again for the 1st and 10 Tynan on the screen sending that connects got away hopped on five but mourns his way to the 26 on a gain of 11 yards through the air I get a really nice chap throwing the ball on first down last week against the Colts six of seven they run it so well on first down a lot of opportunities on a one on one looks outside the numbers on first down Watkins with nothing received last week in that they're effective wasn't targeted until late in the game against Indianapolis after a 65 reception season last year first and 10 for the 27th Sutton the block time for 1040 Glenn the block that the left tackle a little bit high for the rookie Carlos Williams on the coverage by Jimmy Collins of the Patriots when we talked about the new coaching staff here in Buffalo of course you've got a new offensive coordinator so you got to ask yourself who are they this is an offense that's clearly committed to running the football make no mistake about that they ran the ball on more than 65% of their offensive plays last week and that's what Rex wants to do he wants to run the football beat you up in the defense of the creator' was in field position and he's found in the kicking game its retail for the secondary shutting down in jail FinCEN sake of life as did brain McCoy runs for eats earlier he ran for 15 on this Drive he was so productive for both Andy Reid and Chip Kelly infilled off you and he can do it all he's got great vision and cutting a building he's so good at making the first defendant miss Logan Ryan is coming as an extra defensive back for the New England Patriots third down into opening drive quarterback get a run for 23 big play on this drive so far third entry hex McCoy back down by Dante Hightower these spices his way there 16 on a gator for with another Buffalo first now Missi McCoy come off and Carlos Williams come in his first carry last week was for a touchdown they will use all three running backs in this system second tight end has come in Mathew Mulligan running back is Carlos Williams the rookie Williams ready touchdown run last week Belted about the 13 yard line was it by hi John Hunter Dana he's a bit of a tone setter Kevin when you think about running backs I mean I know he's a guy that's used to lining up in the I formation and and really just running between the tackles very strong and good once he gets up on the second level but we've got a nice little changeup now with what they have on was sean mccoy into bringing the bigger bats in terms of boobie Dixon and Carlos Williams I invited the drive shut him down in to make it second down and eight Tanner Holden autobahns inside the five he was forced there by Logan Ryan he picks up ten can they get that punch set you're gonna see Logan I'm hoping he starts inside and then he works right back out to get all the the flow and the motion away from you and then they wind up bootlegging out the backdoor designed by Greg Holman they told us at Aegon they'd have a bigger part in today's game they the smart player Kevin very good in the slot I've been a secondary first in golf the to easy touchdown Carlos Williams a twoyard touchdown run this is where buffalo is really good Eric you would inside Richie incognito you see the push they get the kick out by the right guard John Miller too easy for Carlos Williams Williams with his second rushing touchdown as a throw on a 10play 80yard Drive if the extra point put in by Dan Clark and in on that drive a 23yard one by Taylor 15 yard and eight yard ones by McCoy then the Whoopie takes it in to yard touchdown run Carlos Williams that is a pretty significant way to begin the game for the bill that's how you want to go 10 plays 80 yards and fights job mixing it up moving the run and pass on first down and a good way to finish for Carlos Wales was Jordan game the only true kickoff specialist in the NFL if there's ever there to keep that man Jean Louis latest in the prints all over that Pittsburgh win a week and a half ago here comes the super boy Nicky Brady down shut himself GTI touchdown run by buffalo land age 20 and look at the record he has and the numbers is put up in his career against the Buffalo Bills with the touchdown is a forced engine for the win this is Brian customer and many lessons like some out of bounds minimal gain on the play thought about a yard this is the wine and a second consecutive start for the interruptive rookie out of Georgia David Andrews stork distill interview boot busts mckillop one was suspended last week back to the lineup today as it's done second down and nine Lewis is in the backfield five in the secondary editing there there are em quick there's a Williams at end of the yard of a play they welcome back Marcel sorry ass on that line first team all applaud terrific proud of another lieutenant echols rather this is the secondary we'll just when that check what goes down and eight Tom please how in the world can it communicate with this noise unbelievable let's you get in this position what do you do well Kevin you don't see that very often the posts go down in the game brain he's forced to burn a timeout and just it's so loud he's trying to make the calls up front remember now he's got a rookie in there at the center position and david andrews so you got to make sure that everybody is on the same page that's the one thing that offensive coordinator josh mcdaniels told us last night you know we can't let buffalo dictate how this game is played and it's going to be a physical challenge meant to stand up to but most importantly we have to be on the same page if if we make a mistake let's all 11 of us make the same mistake at least be on the same page communication and identification identify the who the Mike linebackers who the safeties are what the coaches are is going to be so important for Grady as we saw it to spare it's almost impossible to communicate this crowd boys within third in a tenement you can see the arms legocontent ey bottom of this thing again still no that's the max up they want they want Gilmore on brown the clips is on and pretty goes down the sideline which isn't complete Darby was watching it on them it's cleared out on New England's first possession the Patriots will punt I'm not surprised to see Brady go after the young corner Ronald Darby but he's a guy that can run in Rex Ryan told us on Friday Kevin he's going to be a good one they've got some really good corners here in Buffalo left footed punter Ryan Alan won't fun deep bad for the Buffalo Bills Marcus sit down get his back anytime a 43 King always got room to ram and on the punic bouncing out of bounds he takes it to the New England 45 yard line a 54yard punt a 30yard return we've got two flags down at the 38 on Torbert our firstyear referee isn't John during the return illegal block in the back one return team number 50 ten large senator Randy Johnson is guilty trying to set a sound record today with the Guinness Book of World Records in attendance where weekend starts with her cousins and the Redskins battling rival Eli Manning of the Giants it's all you on Thursday Night Football on CBS said NFL Network three now for the New England Patriots penalty on a 30 yard return against Buffalo so it pushes it to the 28 they got a first in Jen McCoy is with felt me on the handoff front I want a whole lot they're played well by Butler and brought down the play they sheared it's a loss of E on the 27 well ton of speed on this offense Kevin including the quarterback we already saw Tyrod Taylor scamper for 23 yards but you think about Watkins and Harvin at the wide receiver position McCoy at the running back position and even Charles clay who came over and free agency from Miami's can really attack the scenes of vertically down the middle of a field if this brought in Garron Hartman in the secondary so five back there sucking down 11 Tanner Tanner Jones will chase reeled in by Mulligan and gets back to the line of scrimmage only a gain of two the Rams the Redskins and let's end it now to New York Washington on the ground yeah 39 yards right here by Matt Jones rookie in Florida gives Washington Redskins a seven nothing lead over the st. Louis Islands let's take it back with Kevin Harlan and Rich Gannon Rams were pretty impressive in their week 11 against Seattle rich can you get a great defensive line point out a couple sacks Donald had a couple sacks it is a third and nine here having a word with Sean trail Henderson the right tackle and I wonder if he was observed getting up slowly on the last play thus they stopped play and they bring him out of the game let's go see if I'm walking off the field you said he got hit in the neck it looks like right there so they won't bring in Cyrus one jaw at the right tackle position well if there is suspicion of a concussion the player will be escorted to the off the field and maybe even to the locker room where our team physician and UNC will conduct a full assessment such am a secondary third down in nine big Italian potato there comes nigga touch no place to run no place to hide we stepped out of bounds they say before he launched back at the 22 was a sack they lose seven really nice play by rob minkoff it's the veteran I mean this is the challenge we talked about setting the edge keeping Tyrod Taylor in front of a really good discipline good angle good adjustment thereby make of its to force the sack there is Danny Amendola waiting the punt from Colton Smith that was 50 yards per punt last week against the Colts there's a challenge flight thrown out before the punt but they'd not stop play and go at the 27 they up his waves old yards he's out near the 36 the red flag challenge flag was thrown on before it looked like before the snap now I think we're at the chip I think the referees checking with the lion judge in terms of whether or not he threw it in time it seemed to be challenging this right here the ruling is he stepped on the chalk before he got the ball away I think that ball comes out before that bucket boundary challenge flag is still on the field at the 32 listen I threw it I promise you well I still enjoy visiting with Rex Ryan on Fridays they have to practice and he's not afraid to tell you how he feels and what he's what he wants to do was so close has been ruled on the field that he was out of bounds when he threw Ryan would like the challenge and the officials are discussing first drive by Buffalo again after 20 80 yard drive quarterback ran 423 got a 10 yard pass to Hogan 11 yard pass to Watkins and then a 2 yard touchdown by ruling that play us out reviewable flag came down at the ball was tapped to play completed the play will meet you in town you'll be doing this ball first I'll come out 49yard fun tenyard and a no I'll return 6:32 in the first text that one Buffalo they meet at 6:32 and the first year his watch the web fly go sailing in rather than shot at Renison at the Long Street ss waved it off listen to that sense of Grady will the twisting change 2nd position 3 and out the first time they have the ball ready right on the screws cut by Dodson knocked out of bounds on the play by Stephon Gilmore gain of 16 it is a first down Mike Carey is joining us from New York Mike what's your read on what just happened here Kevin Ellis very smooth if the ruling on the field is out of bounds or down by contact with the Florida back throwing the ball not like it is on down by contact fun day first and 10 T pennies cut crank house key inside the tin drive he brought him down 36 yard strike and a first down for New England wow what a great thrill here they put the line back running on this way then he's going to get covered by the corner coming right but a perfect throw and kids get too dumb for the Patriots up the seen when I got a first and goal by the wave it off there's a flag now we've got a penalty against the offense of the Patriots you just brought the 36yard passions trying well you think about Tom Brady and week one down on the red zone how effective he was five of six with four touchdown passes three of them going to Gronk the other one to his other tight end Scott Chandler the biggest challenge I think for Buffalo first of all identifying the personnel groupings and formations and really match it up with the taller tight ends first and goal on the 15 Grady moves up nicely and then hits the deck back at the line of scrimmage he was shown down by Williams but in this precious position didn't want to mess things up no games tough to teach an old dog new tricks of a Tom Brady's not looking to run but he's been looking to buy some time in the pocket a nice job there by that Buffalo second they're really more of a coverage sack than anything else second goal McGrady is so good at recognizing looks at trying to do the offense ability but really gotta confuse them and pull out of it after the snap of the football into the nickel he's got his receiver at the yard line and that is Edelman who caught 11 passes against Pittsburgh last week he picks up six right there I said it's always a chess match Kevin with the quarterback like great he doesn't need a lot of time to find a completion and it's hard to confuse him because he knows the offense so well he knows where his quick answer throws are to gets the ball out so quick especially down in this pond the field and just took out one of the tight ends Chandler they've brought in Amador the Dobson Edelman and Gronk at the top of your screen wide curtain go up to eat Grady touchdown Julian Edelman the 8yard diving reception and the Patriots get six they actually double Edelman with the linebacker and the safety look at the mm he still finds a way to get open down on the goal line he is so productive all he does is get open almost 75% of his career catches are within 10 yards of the line of scrimmage and that's where he does most of his damage touchdown trans number 397 the Brady eight yard touchdown pass Edelman Brady now is thrown five touchdown passes on the season four against the Steelers opening night Thursday Gus Costigan and we are tied with 402 deployed in the first quarter the big play 36 yard pass to Gronkowski sets up the a yard touchdown pass on the drive Brady four of four we play every game of the 2015 season on demand with NFL game Pass go to nfl.com slash game pass to start your free trial John Brady with the touchdown pass of eight yards to Julian Edelman in josh mcdaniels discussing things right there we had a great talk in McDaniels last night is the ensuing kickoff I guess Kowski parthiman he's gonna point it out from four yards deep confer scene trying to find some room and then not about as he goes with the return of 27yard a flag has been thrown out in the return by percy harvin a lot of big plays and a lot of penalties on special teams last week kevin reason why you have so many young players so many new players learning how to play on teams holding the return team aqua sees with 8:11 penalties last weekend they went over the Colts here's that 400 Touchdown Club on top of course Manning with 5:30 is that amazing what a great human player is all well either are in the Hall of Fame will be in the Hall of Fame at some point 397 touchdowns for Brady and in order to do that you have to play a long time at a very high level and you can't miss games with the exception of the 2008 season we had the injury this guy doesn't miss starts they're the first intent Sammy Watkins a block can play and mulligan there's not a whole lot of room out there it's a gain of a yard on the play you can see Heights on wood thinking that ball maybe loosen Mayo is in there too but they've ruled him down at the 11 where it's a controlled passing game a lot of quick throws and you think about Tyrod Taylor last weekend and only four of his 19 passes went further than 10 yards down the field so they want to get the ball out quick he does want to be known there's a running quarterback but a quarterback rich who can run absolutely and I think that you know that's an area where he has to develop we have to see if he's comfortable and can he function from the pocket that's a minute go outside it goes Harvin it's on to Devon dense read very well outside Logan Ryan was right there in the lobby y'all to the play that near the 10 and this is what the Patriots won Kevin they want to be successful in the early downs and they want to put Tyrod Taylor in these logs third down situations I think the key the number is 25 they're going to be north of 25 in terms of throwing the ball Tyrod Taylor only through it as I said last week just 19 times they want that number to be up around 30 or 35 put the game in the hands of the young quarterback and make him beat you said to the secondary third down and ten taylorann to come up the middle we may play in town is it a safety they call him down inside the one terrific pressure on the play from guys like Collins and Jones and Ming kovitch loss of nine second Patriots act today ISM well just keep an eye on Collins they get confused inside the left guard Richie incognito steps out he opens up a huge gap for the linebacker Jamie Collins well it's really close whether or not that was certainly inside the one yard line Buffalo very fortunate that wasn't a safety there's a bit of a breeze in the face of the punter here Colton Schmitt is only in the second year in the National Football League he doesn't have the 414 yards to punt either it's a little bit shrunk and a flag has been thrown delay a game move it back about what three inches penalty on the Buffalo Bills and rich all have been on teams or farm special teams and when we talked about it and you get a lot of young players guys that were draft picks and that didn't have to play special teams in college snip and endure I'm the 45yard line here comes Daniel and Ola he got by the long snapper he's got down by proving Dixon with a sweet return of 23 yards after a 54yard punt by Schmidt and they're gonna put the ball at the 27 yard line of the bills well the Patriots really got it going on that last Drive and a couple of big throws by Tom Brady not really running the football they're thrown of the bonds and a big throw down the field the Gronkowski not bad coverage this just goes to show you how difficult it is to cover crops on the open field and even though they doubled Julian Edelman down inside the red zone Patriots still find a way to get it done flags all over the field back at the 33 on the far side of the field up floats at the opening drive 80 yards 2 yard touchdown run by their rookie running back Carlos Williams out of Florida State second possession for the pants here a touchdown pass to Edelman set up by a 36 yard strike grunts there are two bad ball fouls both by the kicking team dead ball personal foul number 20 that Fowler's decline dead ball personal foul number 27 fifteen yards from the end of the twentyseven Duke Williams which of the mistakes are coming from the Buffalo Bills can you get too too high too much I've done going yeah you know I think I think you can I don't think that's really the case here davin you just don't want to get Brady any help Tom Brady doesn't need any help and now you know you give the situation whether they have the ball inside the 15yard line to start to start to drive 2008 we're gonna watch rich today the young interior line of the Patriots the guards in the center against that one good defensive line of Buffalo yeah really a matchup to watch Kevin eat you mentioned it they're so young inside along that offensive line and they've got to go up against some really good players you got to pour boilers and in Marcel Darius and Kyle Williams so David Andrews and Shaq Mason are going to have their hands full inside first and ten Brady Edelman walk down by Justin Brown the middle linebacker to the seven on the guinot seven through the air and that's the matchup to watch I think getting Edelman matched up on the linebackers I mean I don't care how good of a line back yards to be so difficult to cover to cover Edelman in the field whether it's Preston Brown or magic rattle second down Louis shifting cutting diving touchdown 6yard touchdown one by Dion Lewis look at Rob Gronkowski watch the kick out here on Mario Williams he's not just a good route runner but he's a guy that's willing to be an inline player and blocking the running game and of course Dion Lewis he has that jump cut that helps him slip a lot of tackles up there inside he's been traded cut twice missed the last two years of the broken leg merged last week against the Pittsburgh Steelers and has already damaged the bills with that swarming six yard touchdown run with Gus Kowski trying to tack on one more late in the first it's 14 to 7 Patriots they've gone to the air hit element for 8 and with a 23 yard punt return by Amendola it sets up the six yard touchdown run by Dan Lewis four years out of Pitt flag thrown there's some extracurricular pushing on the play is back at the 25 yard line the extra point is good after the extra point let's pour some like conduct Carney by the defense rich they had five of those last week against the Colts five of them well they're selfdestructing I mean you gotta have some some poise you see Williams right there push at the bottom the screen on Scotty Chan there one of his old teammates you just can't do it go through a less than one quarter five special teams penalties on Rex Ryan's different group then that has hurt them so far five in the first quarter that means the kickoff is gonna occur on the 50 yard line with that 15yard penalty I forgot such a great start with the opening kickoff and marching downfield 80 yards two consecutive scores here for the Patriots in their three possessions today is Matt Patricia can you see there on the red jacket Tom Brady in the background with Josh McDaniels those are the two coordinators who have spent time on the other side of the ball Belichick likes to crosstrain his guys doesn't his coaches it really does I think all of them have spent time in the scouting department or on offense or defense before they settled in as coordinators it's kind of a farm system Kevin you think about working for coach Belichick and he said so many great coaches that I'm coming into the organization we always say he's looking for PhDs guys who are poor hungry and driven and are willing to do the work he's got a bunch of them on that staff there is Patricia right there here are the guys it's Josh McDaniels of course former head coach and now back with the Patriots leading the offense they actually started in personnel and he said that no be a good coach yet the sub has to be a good scout and looking Matt Patricia he actually worked with Dante scar neck yet his first year look with helping out the offensive line and I just think that you know that's a too great way to learn how to coach the entire football team they're somebody's assistant coaches are just worried about coach in their area good story McCoy on first and ten from Taylor he is plugged up right there with the Dean of a little more than a yard all kinds of guys coming through by the way no dominate easily today he is injured with the hip he hurt against Pittsburgh in of a yard sucking down nine well they got off to a great start ten plays 80 yards but those two three and outs given we always talk about their demoralizing to a football team and I always thought of myself as a quarterback playing against a Tom Brady or Peyton Manning every drive is absolutely critical because when you give it back to him you have to assume that he's gonna come away with put points every time he touches the football great tackle maybe by Jamie Cowen stopping McCoy in his truck right at the 20 yard line no gain employment and a buffalo is not doing a good enough job with Jamie Collins he's running through that a gap between the center and gar we saw him on the sack and now he gets the run through on the run stop Tom Brady has put a touchdown pass they've gotten a six yard touchdown run and they lead by seven at the end of one welcome back tortured Park with a look at the first quarter numbers time a possession stands out seven points the result for Buffalo but they've had five penalties rich on special team Jen who's struggling a little bit right now on first and second down they find themselves in some big numbers on third down a third and 10 in the first drive third nine and now another third nine in this series five in the second area comes Taylor and it's picked off by Butler jumps up gets up brought down by Harvin it's the game's first turnover and Malcom Butler the hero of Super Bowl xlix puts a smile on the face of his defensive coordinator Matt Patricia are you gonna see the quarterback Tyrod tell he's looking to his left he comes back to his right a little bit late this one just sails on him and that what a great interception by Malcom Butler when I first saw it Kevin I thought maybe it hit the ground but a great job great concentration by the secondyear corner well Rivas is gone Brendan browner is gone Ellington is gone they've had to revamp the secondary Butler comes up with a big tick right there on the 30yard line second consecutive New England beginning field position in Buffalo territory balls get tipped or deflected it's never a good thing for quarterbacks a most I most always wind up in the hands of the defense trae Jackson alley with the white dog pretty first intent Dion Lewis Gronkowski a layup one finally knocked out of bounds by Preston ground the linebacker at the 14 yard line of Buffalo on a catchin run at 16 and Brady is is gonna jump the ball and again it makes it so difficult this tempo for Rex Ryan to dial up all those pressures and also to make substitutions in this part of the field don't give you a chance to catch your breath into the nickel plating first in ten Datsun bad buy Gilmore lunges a head down to the seven yard line and they'll pick up seven right there when Brady does a great job distributing the ball he doesn't discriminate he'll throw it to anybody who's open the ball comes out so quick with a second down in three Louis look the jackoff darkness easy slippery he is bitch down near the two yard line with a gain of five he is so elusive look at Grady last 10 past tense we talked about it in week one Kevin 19 straight against the Steelers he's in his last seven he could get on a roll that's the challenge I think for Buffalo context train disrupt the timing and the rhythm of Tom Brady first and door pretty elegant off his fingertips if the coverage on the plane buys to find Gilmore well Stefan Gilmore is their best corner that fit the pills to a nice job see how the two corners pass it off Gilmore stays outside and he takes the chute route it's been a lot of extra time you and I were out of practice on Friday Kevin that Friday practice went on forever they spent a lot of extra time working on their red zone defense three tight ends hole mentally goes wide as does Gronkowski and as those Chandler saw the very same formation a week 1 against Pittsburgh 1 says in second goal and easy touchdown pass to clunker ski on to yarder Brady's second touchdown pass of the day and they cash in on the interception thrown by Taylor we talked about plays that looked the same that are different we saw this very same sequence in week 1 against Pittsburgh and he did two things he ran the slant and he ran the fade now he runs the little inner out in the back of the endzone and that's the beauty of Josh McDaniels system plays that looked the same Kevin for a defense but yet are very different on Cosby is caught for red zone pitches this season all for four touchdowns Miss Danski 21 to 7 New England they first of all got the ball at the Buffalo of 30 catching 116 yards Luis Gronkowski in the vent from Amherst New York slams at all Tom Brady with a couple of touchdown passes here in the first half week to continues related to Nathan Fox then tonight with Sunday Night Football on NBC and then tune in tomorrow from Monday Night Football on ESPN they trade on a Robert Kraft in attendance news in Boston last night receiving an award is terrific work with charities humanitarian efforts in the Boston and Providence area Kim Pegula one of them honors the the right hand side corner for the Buffalo Bills new ownership new feel and they open new direction came in with outside today but Patriots halves more than the last three consecutive possessions Marvin a chance to return this good kickoff why Augusta what now for Taylor richer down at home early in the game and just real fit well this is a critical possession of Bills have been held without a first down in the last three drives they've had two three and outs and and Kevin they're in danger of really letting this one get away from him they they don't want to fall behind by three scores and have to ask Tyrod Taylor to throw in a bunch they have to be able to stick with the game plan and be able to mix it up they'll be able to have some success running the football and really slow this team down a little bit put together a big eight nineten play drive and keep Brady all the sidelines here's the first intent from the pistol the coin back there with Taylor is making his reads pocket is crumbling my gaze was on the poised grab by sheer from behind as I saw Susan pick up she was from Cleveland the innovate on first down for the bills well the Patriots are playing so much eightman front football to bringing the safeties down there really crowding the line of scrimmage and discouraging the Buffalo Bills from running the football Buffalo's would have to throw the ball push the ball down the field on first down take advantage of the speed that you have outside Patriots living with for in the secondary second down and short to mr. McCoy finding nothing the Carson room their shared was there also G McGowan where's Collins at a terrific first half loss of a yard in the play it's back to the 27th and the big concern with sean mccoy Kevin he just hasn't had the work and the conditioning isn't where it needs to be and so they have to clearly monitor his workload but we saw him at practice on Friday I thought it looked pretty good not bad and he wants to get on the same page with the offensive line too rich because they've had such little work together as you said we're in the preseason that affects everything you do throw it into by the brand pressure tailing a Danson from behind Chandler Jones bring them down that's the third set for the New England defense they throw him back to the 20 it's a loss of eight pull it down boy they just smother him you're gonna see Chandler Jones he's gonna come off the side but pressure up inside and again they're trying to get oneonones with the offensive line they mate the back McCoy come up and block and Tyrod Taylor he's looking for a lane but Chandler Jones gets him from behind Schmidt will punt and Deepak they've got Edelman leading his pressure he was run into and there's a flag he is run into by Rufus Johnson who is a player from Darlington State it was fourth and 10 when they put it if they run into them it's only a fiveyard penalty they had fourth and ten and that's fine that's just going to eat it can't be Ruffin you wouldn't think all teams coming in want to know Bill Belichick in the Patriots have the best record in the month of September going back to 2005 boasting their six consecutive AFC East Division titles you got a pretty good record in october/november in January 59 and was Rufus Johnson yep can't touch those guys they're worse than quarterbacks Kevin Gators and punters Patriots and rich for special teams penalties against the Steelers on opening Thursday and we talked with Coach Belichick about those concerns that use some of it the extra days that they had to prepare this week for Buffalo really concentrating on special teams Schmidt from Cal Davis to punt again this time Amendola is back there by himself he steers it those sit to the sidelines and some shovin after the plane Edelman's caught a touchdown pass Louis's long run in and Glen Kowski with another touchdown reception the Patriots began fleeing out and scored three consecutive times but the touchdown passes by Brady and after the punt by Buffalo first and ten from the 42 last two possessions and started a buffalo territory Brady on first and ten wafting it down he's got Glenn Kowski and then poking up beautifully by Gerry Hughes complete seconds and well that's the matchup they want Ron Kowski on Jerry Hughes a better throw here by Tom Brady baby gets it done drunkest got ass full down a little bit still should catch it it's in his hands shoes it's a nice job ripping it out but the Patriots are doing a great job Kevin in their empty backfield alignments they're getting five receivers out to getting oneonone matchups and Brady's doing a good job I didn't find the front and getting the ball out quickly into the nickel seconds and Edelman is that under there by coy Graham who left the Colts game last week with a head injury close to a first down yep Edelman the number one receiver for this New England patron finding his way to the 48 yard line a buffalo I think there are different approaches and philosophies work versus Rex Ryan some offenses are so protection conscious they want to keep seven or eight in DuBois the Patriots on the other hand they want to get the receivers in the tight ends and the backs out in the route Trust Brady to recognize the Blitz and get the ball out quick this puts a lot of stress on the back end of the Buffalo Bills and he first in 10 Louis and he's builted and the Paul is free and it's fat give in it was just the veteran Corey Graham going the other way Louis humble you may recall there's a flag thrown at the 28 Lewis it fumbled against the Pittsburgh Steelers is another fumble Lewis in the opener fumbled against the Pittsburgh Steelers which Gronkowski recovered just outside the goal line inside the 1 and here's a Louisville fifteen yards Williams again yeah and Brady gets in that Brady doesn't get the grip this ball clearly comes out you mentioned Kevin a fumble and week one against Pittsburgh they had four fumbles all of last season and Bill Belichick he doesn't put up with running backs and receivers who fumble it's an old expression in this business you get what you emphasized and the Patriots emphasized ball security and we've seen in the past where running backs to put the ball in the ground and you don't see on the rest of the day I can settle them down and offer snack out of the 48 yard line of New England Patriots done anything differently defensively because the first tried by Buffalo was beautiful 80 yards and a touchdown run but the last four have really been cool it ends up keep an eye on the safety Kevin so much eightman front discouraging the Buffalo Bills from running the football they're gonna have to start throwing it more on first down which Taylor will do here with the deep drop on first and 10 in China finds Williams wrestled down on the play by Jonathon Freeney out of Rutgers with a gain of four to the 43 yard line of Buffalo we have to somehow find a way to get the ball outside the numbers a little bit they've got great speed there we talked about it with Percy Harvin and of course Sammy Watkins why could spend pretty quiet Kevin not just today even last week against the Colts need to start getting him the ball News Taylor said he grew up watching John Brady shut him down in six with Iran there's a tackle by Chandler Jones on a gain of three and prowlers Williams takes her down to the 41 of New England it was interesting talking to Tyrod Taylor on Friday said that liked Warren Moon as a kid of course the two quarterbacks that here it really has watched and studied very closely since becoming a pro for Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady the fact that they're so accurate and they get the ball out so quick four down and three okay the motion much at six in the secondary flag is thrown incomplete the coverage by Hightower they were going from McCoy with a flag thrown at the 48 yard line illegal use of hands to the face offense number 76 that penalty is declined is over the play it's worked out rookie starting guard John Miller and they get great field position and they can do nothing with it rich a wasted opportunity there you see the disappointment from Rex Ryan penalties killing Buffalo right now fifth consecutive drive Buffalo has been held without a first down on the punting situation for Colton Smith linguish on this one Amendola they're caught up to 12 which will take us to a break in 905 to play in the first half Brady a couple touchdown passes 21 7 this pastures in Buffalo Bills rookie club joined USA football now is the first ever headsup football clinic about Wilson Stadium kids were instructed in popper heads up tackling and blocking techniques designed the game of football feta and Sutra to all participants there's a young promising player secondround pick Ronald Darby out of Florida State starts and plays and watch this Brady now loses in the first student after the punt by the pillows Michael Williams he was brought down from behind by Corey Graham along with a couple Williams was on an alabama thought i'm gonna trade with detroit 15yard catch and run quickly a first down look at tom radians and the matchup with Rex Ryan over the years and certainly gotten the better of him better of it if Stanton Brady goes deep he's got Edelman but it was knocked away the coverage by but Cory Rambo in complete suck it in Trenton we were just talking about his career numbers versus Rex Ryan coach defenses and look at that Kevin ten and four even today 13 of 17 135 yards a couple touchdowns and he knows what to expect to polish that last night it won't be easy his recent plays where we we looked silly but there's also some great opportunities to throw the ball down the field second down in 10:1 to the far side takes it up to the 39 that's a 12yard gain by Julian Edelman Patriot's really rich trust their system don't they even in the hostel and islands like this you have to and I think that's what you rely on it and the fact given that you've got a quarterback that's been in the state system for 16 years they've changed coordinators they've changed players but they have not changed the system and this guide knows it's so well versed in 10 Tamala the block at the right tackle at undershot to Gronkowski but coverage by Polygram incomplete to New Yorkers James and coach spiel is in a groove three consecutive possessions three consecutive touchdowns this last one a 35yard into various a word Bay Pittsburgh up 22 2 to 3 over sentence system missed the be 18 back to Kevin and rich thank you guys as Dina Lewis trying to swim away from Mario Williams he picks up three and he pushes it off to about the 41 yard line you a little support hate to see Lewis back in there after he just fumbled on the previous possession yeah usually when that happens takes turns to go stick your head to push this for a while doesn't tolerate it no one likes left third and seven Brady Edelman shy with the coverage by Rambo and former Redskin gain of six on third and seven its fourth and one really surprised they come up a yard short and surprise that joined Edelman didn't push this up another yard was the Patriot jumping the ball here on fourth can walk force and Rex Ryan to make a decision as is again and out that right jackal under the rotation that Belichick uses with the offensive line fourth and one Noah's have to be alert for no snap no play in this situation Thank You Amendola here comes Mario Williams backpedaling is pretty up for grabs and incomplete they turn it over and downs good coverage by the aforementioned rookie Ronald Darby they blew it up on the jump ball the flow out good possession of the ball when we come back gorgeous building that City Hall here in Buffalo coming up on the horizon halftime report JP Tony pipe Rome ranked coach cows scores news and highlights plus a preview of Thursday Night Football on CBS in the NFL Network all coming up on the Verizon halftime report with NFL MVP which can in Kevin Harlan are terrific CBS crew on the possession for the bills in New England territory from the 48 for a second consecutive time first and ten underneath McCoy Pauley swiftly flag is down walk down was drawn by the Thailand play a 22yard catching one down to the 26 let's see what that flag is all about it's gonna come back and I think it's on Buffalo Bills don't have a first down since their opening drive when they went 80 yards and got a 2 yard touchdown run it's a 5yard penalty replay first out wipes out rich a 22yard gain one interesting the tight end wasn't lined up on the line of scrimmage right there Kevin it's little things like that Mathew Mulligan got an illegal formation and it wipes out the the big catch and run but most Sean McCoy first and 15 that's the four defensive backs studied by Tennant pocket compass incomplete and maybe bobbled and reeled in by Watkins after Carlos Williams couldn't hold on gain of four down throughout the 48 yard line their original line of scrimmage Tyrod Taylor kevin has to learn to take a little off some of these throw this ball coming out so high and it's hard for the back to catch it and the other thing is he's got to see it leave the hand of the quarterback I think yeah I think he does catch that ball Sammy Watkins great adjustment on the fly you got to take a little bit off when you throw those backs and it's important for the back to see the ball leave your hand there it's on the nickel sucking down to going deep and it's got his receiver Harvin no yah there's a late frost from the coverage by probably Fletcher as they were justing down the sideline we talked about how important is going to be football we talked about how important it would be for a buffalo to be able to roll the ball down the field to see Bradley Fletcher there with the arm bar grabbing on the right shoulder Percy Harvin there's a reason why Kevin the Brantley Fletcher is no longer playing for Chip Kelly in Philadelphia he really struggled honestly he really struggled with the deep ball we've had a lot of coaches tell us that this is the way a lot of teams are going to attack the Patriots because they're a little bit depleted in the second I knew and if the second didn't get three new corners lose Revis Brown and Arrington from the season ago first and goal McCoy as they've felt no off for a block here's Taylor chased by negatives touchdown Charles clay and the bills are back in business boy great great patience by Tyrod Taylor you going to see clay initially he's blocking and then he turns around and realizes that Tyrod Taylor is scrambling but he makes the adjustment but really nice job by Taylor just happens to patients and keeping his eyes down the field off the scramble the big penalty on Bradley Fletcher of 39 yard penalty in essence two plays 48 yards extra pointers away and it is no good carpenter missing which day is 2113 with 513 to play in the first half another flying game at the 28 nobody saw some extra points missed in week one boy unsportsmanlike conduct taunting by the defense I'm the Patraeus there's the touchdown pass by Tyrod Taylor who threw a touchdown pass last week of 51 yards to Harvin that time it's the tight end clay but carpenter is yvx dolphin wide right 513 second quarter to play 48 yard drive big penalty on the secondary of New England gives the great position a goal to go situation for the offense of Lex Ryan now another missed extra point that's what you think of this new rule this year back to the 23 yard line where I know the kickers don't like it Kevin the drill you think about a key person made 99.3% of the kicks a season ago at least 98 percent of their extra points every season since 1994 so certainly the competition committee trying to revisited this and decided that it was getting it to be too easy for these kickers the kickoff by Jordan game was at the 15 because of the unsportsmanlike conduct penalty charged against the New England Patriots we kicked off from the 50th sales over the head of louis lesce the 20 yard line first of Djenne the 71 of the 75 extra points a through a week once of 94.7% but you know what's really going to be interesting as we get into November and December even here in Buffalo where the weather starts become even more of a factor Mayson the left guard Andrews Lucas enters the two rookies their bombers back in at the right tackle client the right dog first exam Grady flight throne and they go outside Traverse cadet handling a hamstring gain of two it across the way by Gilmore as I told you a flag was thrown that a lot of it Tom Brady today now ski for 36 right there they look really sharp Kevin 14 of twenty hundred thirtyeight yards a couple touchdowns and he's made some really nice drills how to read them outside the pocket sucking down nine Brady deep Gronkowski oh what a catch but he was on the chunk no good Graham was there one official said no one official said yes they waved it off then complete what a catch nonetheless my goodness look at his ability to go up and guess what clearly out of bounds but Brady's going to go back and look at this one he passes up he it to easy completion to Julian Edelman the Giants field the ball down field versus to grog versus double targets murder nine here they tiny down he goes Tereus second set by the Buffalo defense today flag at the 32 flag again it's on the bills but it's a great job last week with the pressure packages and an automatic first they see they get it done with a fourman rush and did such a great job last week against Andrew Luck and the Colts bringing pressure but being really tied down on the back end they've not done a good enough job today on the back end give up too many throws and completions to brady already the first half first antenna Boldin is in they get ones flag silver foil ilion's and picked and plucked his way for being back to the line of scrimmage and that was it what is here hold Kevin is backing at the right tackle Josh Klein this is turning into a sloppy game really for both teams Kevin against them penalties in the kicking game they've got some personal fouls they've got some holding holding penalties josh mcdaniels told us yesterday communication was the first thing we talked about this week don't fall asleep on your team first in 2000 he's gonna make it to Hampton this is in first in 20 dropped by Edelman coverage by Gilmore suck it in Jen you look at Tom Brady I really got a kick out of our visit with him last night when he said you know at this point in my career I've broken little patience for mistakes because I can't tolerate him and you know he receiver runs around to shorter he misses the throw drives him crazy he expects perfection for himself and everyone around them it's a big big reason why he's one of the best seven for the position second down 20 Brady mutton for Louis he's got the guy he had the matchup against Branham and he gives a muchneeded breathing space downfield to the Buffalo Bill 39 on a catch and run now 34 we talked about putting air on the football given the receiver a chance to make a play really nice touch here by Tom Brady putting a little air on it so di Lewis can run underneath it as you mentioned Kevin this is a a mistake to matchup problem for the bills but another 43 and a quick first and 10 its newest who twists and turns his way into the grass but Graham and picks up 13 so they say he hit the chalk at the 43 nonetheless it's a 13yard catching on right there by this kid Deana Louis like we said miss the last two years with a broken leg injury he's bounced around he lands as a patriot and he has been terrific first two weeks Bob organizer granted McCall you have WiFi solder and then squeeze inside by Brown not much there gain of a yard as he takes it down to the 30yard line a buffalo in Kevin we were talking to Brady to last night he said that you know so much of their offense it's really one word you know they had these little words and phrases it tells you everything formation protection round adjustments has it's not an easy system to learn for young players suck at 9 the twisting Bouldin at fine Preston Brom he makes all the defensive calls you one of the tackles a year ago he allows just to gain a tune out of the 28 really nice play nearby the tackle eyes up see it to hit certain sentiment Grady grande defend behind him and then he has found in a sandwich Aaron Williams on one side Roby in the vicinity it's incomplete is the question on a cross well we seen Brady missed a couple throws here and this is a tough one for Gronk it's behind him he's got to try and make a onehanded grab and then he gets he gets sandwiches you said Kevin between two safeties we're gonna try a field goal here with Stephen Gostkowski of 46 Nora is led the NFL in scoring three consecutive yields what a year he had last year from 46 light breeze drills it 46 yard field goal the big play two of them by Dion Lewis of 34 yard catchin one a 13 yard catch and run then Gus husky right down the middle tomorrow on CBS the geniuses from last season's hit drama are back don't miss the season premiere of Scorpion tomorrow at 9:00 8:00 central only CBS with Rich Gannon Kevin Harlan beautiful day in western New York a 217 lead at one time by the big Francis now 24 13 with that field goal moments ago 46 yards Vargas Kowski hogan is deep that the top hops going in three for Buffalo this one will sail over his head so back to the 20 it'll be a touchback Tyrod Taylor in the offense will get it first down in ten yards to go early fantasy leaders I thought Ben Roethlisberger and the Steelers you give him a couple extra days prepare and Kevin you and I Sol Jamaal Charles in person last week and in Houston of course unfortunate for him to be able to put the ball on the ground into that game that's it's one and we'll stick with you forever well Beckham jr. with her big start I want a who played his college football at Virginia Tech the handoff on first in ten the elusive McCoy gets his way to the 31 with the 12yard gain on first coy with 42 yards dead end string and all running against Belichick's defense we are at the twominute warning the New Buffalo offensive coordinator used to call the plays in San Francisco and he's a good one Kevin he's smart I thought he's a terrific job last week structuring a game plan erupt around with Tyrod Taylor was comfortable with and what he does well wished inside for Taylor he's got Sammy Watkins he will take it out to the 41 going for nine across the middle after the 12 yard run by McCoy just before as you look at your call sheet as a play caller you've got a look at plays specifically designed to get the ball to Sammy Watkins he's kind of your home run hitter kid and he's been quiet here for six quarters of the read will cease second down in one it's Marvin slips on the turf in his bluff down by Sir L Brown he's got the first down though he picks up two and with three timeouts buffalo hands the ball to own 43 Harvin has gotten better as a receiver and he buildeth he struggled at times in Minnesota and in Seattle with the Jets and you know he can do a handful of things well turn to the garage to slant route but I think he's really worked hard at his craft to try and become a complete receiver first and ten it's LeSean McCoy who was hit by Jang among others with a gain of two to the 46 yard line and before with all three timeouts why would you use them here rich those timeouts Ron let's start burning them just yet I don't get to fall back to Brady the Patriots they've got a convert a third down Kevin him his drive alive it's at that point maybe burn one Taylor second mate being chased by Rufus Jensen and douse it about midfield and he's brought down on the play by Logan Ryan timeout taken by Buffalo coming up at the Verizon halftime report GB Tony Park Wolverine Coach Cal scores news highlights as well as a preview of Thursday Night Football on CBS and NFL Network that's all coming up on the Verizon halftime report rich as we pull back a little bit aside from that guys here what is interested you in this first down well it's amazing I mean you know Buffalo is able to even come away with a field goal in this situation Kevin it's still just a one score eight point game and so they're still in this football game and you know it hasn't always been pretty offensively but you know they just need a big play or two to get him back in it he's got to come from Tyrod Taylor I think in the passing game in the nickel third and four Henderson toys blocks pink eviction and it's perfect who runs for a first downs of the Patriot 43 Buffalo a timeout a six yard run by Percy Harvin on first half clock at 44 seconds first and ten Taylor pressured and clocked down and that Tom Chandler Jones who had a crate playoff run last year it's a fourth sack for the Patriot defense they push him back to the 49 yard line of Buffalo he's working over Cordy Glenn right now the left tack of the Buffalo Bills this beats him inside with the spin move bills with a single timeout second a team they go underneath brows claim bounced out of bounds that time by Terrell brown four yard pickup well he's gonna start him up feel then he comes right back underneath Cordy Glen's drove it a little bit with the speed of Chandler Jones just slipped some Tyrod Taylor has nowhere to go the problem right now with Chandler Jones 6x last year we had 11 remember his second year back in 2013 13 14 Carlos Williams for looking running back off the supply Tyrod Taylor going deep he had Watkins missile be picked off and hominis got his second of the season melted down on the play by Henderson a return of 21 yards Doron Amin he picked off Roethlisberger he's just picked off Taylor and that will seal things in the first half for the New England Patriots with the interception thrown by Tyrod Taylor we're getting running and you're gonna see Tyrod Taylor Keaveney gets outside the pocket and once he starts to scramble good good keep rolling it he's still not outside that pocket yet now right here stop it he throws the ball late down the middle and he overthrows his intended target we talked about late throws down the middle never a good thing for a young quarterback Brady will kneel on the ball with five seconds to play in the second quarter the flag we saw it hit dint think it was him run off the field Tom Brady is throwing touchdown passes of eight yards to Edelman Gronkowski to Lewis had a six yard touchdown run Kowski kicked the 46yard field go time to Annie that's Ryan on a big day the highly anticipated matchup with the pills and the Patriots at the half Hill's got on the board early on a two yard touchdown run then three consecutive scores by the reigning champions we're at the half at Buffalo where it's 24 13 New England on CBS it's the Patriots and halftime in Orchard Park now let's take a look at the DirecTV ultimate picture cam Tom Brady with a couple of firsthalf

  "transcript": "two more bluebirds here in Baltimore with the Ravens already owing to to start the season and now at a 14 nothing holes we go down to Dana Jacobson coach I'm gonna take you back to that decision to go for it instead of taking the field goal why well I thought we had good opportunity to get six points there in another seven so you know it backfired on me thanks coach all right Dana that is the end of the first half with the score Cincinnati 14 Baltimore nothing whoop we'll be back with the Verizon halftime report after this message and a word from your local station you're watching the NFL on CBS poll of Super Bowl 50 start up the third corner in Baltimore Cincinnati has a 14nothing lead on the Ravens let's take a look at the DirecTV ultimate picture cam and he does and one touchdown run passing to Marvin Jones all adds up to a 14nothing lead back to the booth with Steve Beuerlein and Steve Tasker I'm Andrew catalon you heard Marvin Lewis tell Dana Jacobson the move back fired down by the goal line to go for came away with no points and see if that proves to be big at the end of the game meanwhile from the Baltimore perspective guys what adjustments to the Ravens have to make well I guarantee it John Harbaugh is happy that Marvin Lewis went to it went for because he kept it to a two score game Baltimore's got to keep trying to come out and make yards on first and second down running the ball or doing little little passes to the flats inside outside whatever but then you got to convert on third down by not trying to go right at this defense you got to spread the ball around this anadi will receive the second half kickoff from Justin Tucker who missed a field goal in that first half Adam Jones out of his own end zone and tripped up he had some daylight up the middle and a little extracurricular activity on the field and I think for the Cincinnati Bengals they've just got a state balance to offensively run and passing on defense it starts with Joe flag though they're playing the desk Britton Baltimore Raven offense and that starts with Joe Flacco throwing the football all over a piece pressured they're gonna be ineffective Adam Jones is still down after returning that kickoff for Cincinnati and now he is walking off the field he'll have some time to catch his breath assuming he's okay before the Cincinnati defense comes out it'll be first in ten for the Bengals from their own 29 yard line Cincinnati trying to go to three and OH for the second straight year this Ravens defense has got to step up right now though what their adjustment is to stop force of three and out or get the ball back quickly for their offense right now then to start this half on the ground with Jeremy hill and look who made the tackle Kendrick Lewis a good sign remember he had to go through the concussion protocol in the first half cleared to come back and he makes the tackle to start the second half that's always a good sign because you know this day and age they're always overly cautious with that situation so he must have been clearly okay to keep going Williams comes up to make the tackle the cave third year man out of Missouri southern states take a look back at that first half you can see the Ravens just caught trailing in every category the turnovers really hurt him the first down sank had trouble staying on the football field Bengals where helped out by the number of penalties it seems like the Raven penalties came at ill opportune moment even though the numbers say they're even tee's was crucial in the success of the biggest Cincinnati 5 through 7 on third downs in the first half fits for than Ghent but the crowd making some noise here in Baltimore Dalton looks right throws right caught by Marvin Jones right at the stick pushed out by Kyle Arrington but with the spot that is a first down Cincinnati that's inexcusable football when they got him backed up to the third and long you got to challenge these throws right there you saw that it's just not enough pressure from Kyle Arrington on that throw again Marvin Jones is a good receiver but you got to challenge him and that's a twoway yeah you got to know where the sticks are he turned his hips about three yards past the sticks and you got to know that that's exactly where the Bengals are gonna throw it don't turn your hips so quick has a defensive back squat on that route make sure that they won't move clear easy one Dalton pancake having trouble on his trip top well that play was a little bit predictable because they had such hard time on first and second down just a moment ago you'd think they came back with a pump fake and go round on first down the second first down of his drive trying to pop one free and the pressure got too dull he tied the step to it couldn't get loose but they knew that the Ravens were going to come with some pressure and tried to take advantage of it and couldn't get it done the Bengals sent Andrew Whitworth lined to the top of your screen the starting left tackle they'll run it within 90 degrees again 69 345 pounds filling the shoes of the departed Haloti Ngata Williams said that not taught him so much in their time together and he makes a big play here yeah I'm not a that was bowed I'm just getting beat off the ball by Brandon wins right there and it doesn't make sense to me to spread out one of your best offensive linemen that trying to put the ball up inside third down and 13 target looking teeth Paige inside the 24h a green again a 44 they had to deep coverage it was a zone coverage and Jimmy Smith fell off you'll watch right here he's got man with two safeties over the top and he got a trailer the safety can't get there what an incredible adjust will hitch a green zone oh yeah will he'll was just late getting there AJ Green had not only time to find the football in the air but adjust his route run underneath it will he'll has got to get there faster than that AJ Green over a hundred yards receiving six catches for up up 20 back to Jeremy Hill let's go back and look at that big play to AJ Green and the adjustment he made on this ball here's here's will Hill back here and here is our guy AJ Green in the spotlight he's gonna come out and run this just ran out and then he has plenty of time to find this ball in the air balls in the air now he looks out his left outside shoulder then turns around to his inside shoulder and he's all by himself well he'll it's as though he was guarding someone else on that play on second and eight dozen fires to hyper incomplete broken up by Kendrick Lewis and it's third down that was a great job by Kendrick Lewis on the big tight end Tyler Eifert who they want in that matchup they want him going against his safety oneonone and piledrivers got to make that play no doubt about it yeah that would have been a it's a good catch not a fantastic ending you got to expect book hands up ball was coming in on him right where he needed it up in his vision third and a party on this drive Cincinnati has picked up forward in 10 and 40 14 let's see if they can convert another four mostly run soft sides CJ Mosley jumped the gun you just can't do that outside number 57 defense unabated to the quarterback fiveyard penalty you just go down they just cannot do this I mean you here's here's Mosley right here just gonna shoot right up the gut and he gets overly excited there's no excuse third and three versus third and eight he's a whole different ballgame Baltimore used to throw out always has been known as the defense that thrives on third and long they've been getting torched here today eighth penalty against hard balls Ravens play the drive for two three four Cincinnati Dalton in China and enchanted Jimmy possible first interception this season thrown by Andy Dalton and a big play for Jimmy Smith in the Ravens Jimmy Smith told us on Friday this is a mustwin game for the Ravens and he makes a big play for Baltimore with that interception giving Joe Flacco on the offense the ball back at the 20 on the run it's Justin Forsett but let's go back to the interception the first of the year by Dalton well here's Jimmy Smith and AJ Green at the top of your screen as he releases to the outside Green's going to try and get up the field but Andy Dalton makes a poor decision to try and fit this in he throws the football right there this balls got to be all the way back here forgive to give aj green a shot at it this way it's under Jimmy Smith's the only guy with a chance at it AJ Green turns into the defensive back and not a very good one second interception this season consuming Smith its second and seventh right there to stop maybe third down for Baltimore on your comment Steve you're a hundred percent right that's called it back pylon throw quarterbacks learned that from the time you play high school you Pop Warner football throw it to the back pylon that's that's where that ball has to go especially when you're protecting a 14point lead you're in the red zone that falls where your guy can get it or nobody can get it it's Andy Dalton's first interception of the year but that was a bad decision bad throw well let's see you Paul tomorrow can finally get something going on third downs just 2 for 7 today 20 yards out first down well it's not like the Bengals weren't watching him you see they're great out of every three guys around them a Jayhawk following him back throws it right that's a tremendous throw by Flacco that's why you love Joe Flacco you can pick post throw he's not afraid to pull the trigger the problem is he's got to make outstanding throws to get a completion against this big look because he'll and he's tripped up by dome atop that goal but there is a flag down holding number 72 offense 10yard penalty still first down that goes against assembly now Steve Smith senior playing with a heavy heart this week his longtime receivers coach in Carolina Richard Williamson died of a heart condition on Monday at the age of 74 Smith took to social media he was with Richards Richard for nine seasons and he said when and I didn't want to work when I was young in my career Richard Williams had made me work and Steve you were with Richard Williamson in Carolina for a while as well I was and I'll make a comment on that and just a second to see what happens here on this first down play Rock gonna pour set tackled at the 39yard line so Richard Williamson I think deserves incredible amount of credit for the development Steve Smith and Muhsin Muhammad and so many other great receivers over the years he was an Alabama country guy that just had this raspy voice and he he told you the way it was laid the law but he loved his well and these players all were very loyal to him because of how loyal he was of them an incredible man and incredible coach and he would in this making the move across midfield in the cincinnati territory seventh catch of the day for Smith that goes for 12 yards as you talk about the key sniffing the guys who have affected his career he's at the point of his career now where he said this is gonna be his last one but even now he's a guy that when this team needs a play they got to think don't think run pass or schemes Rex I know you think what guy do I need to have the ball in his hands and it's still at this point in his career at Steve Smith senior on third and three full set no Larry Michael Johnson makes a contact Carlos Dunlap finished him off and it's fourth down and Sam cook the punter is coming out for the Ravens and now Harbaugh pulls it back off the field well this is a situation where you could justify going for it on fourth fourth down but I don't like the play call in here Marc Trestman zone Office of Court and I have a lot of respect for but on these third and shorts they've been absolutely a step behind against Cincinnati an event terrible success they're going for it on fourth and five the end to run today on poor towns that was to fake punt Baltimore for first board this season on four pounds how big is this plane you see the power and the will of Steve Smith right there he's one of the most explosive players has been in the NFL for the last 10 to 12 years 13 years I guess what did his form now but he is so small but he's so explosive and so strong and his will is what makes it happen consistently time after time when you need him to step up he does that was all Steve Smith that was an absolutely Hall of Fame play because of the moment fourth down you're down by two touchdowns on an own two starts of the season you need somebody to be the guy to carry the team on his back and Steve Smith just a short should have been stopped short didn't put his hand on the ground again puts his hand on the ground gets to the sidelines like he can't say enough about that play and what Steve Smith brings to this team that right there is what being a 15year vet a guy who was once as a wide receiver in the conversation for MVP to leave ones one year that's what he means and that's at that moment to put the ball in his hands when he's already had a couple of catches on the drive they know he's gonna you're gonna look at him and he does that touchdown is confirmed it's the 49 100yard receiving game for Steve Smith and his second thoughts eight pitches 118 yards and Tuckers extra point is good and all of a sudden with that one play it is a brand new football game big momentum change in this game courtesy of Steve Smith senior the 50yard touchdown catch on four and five and all of a sudden that's a 14 to 7 game with 623 to go in the third quarter it's amazing how turnovers come back to haunt you like that it gives the other team to lift and then of course you can't coach what Steve Smith has did sucker kicks it away tape back deep it'll be a touchback he's 36 years old but Steve Smith senior he's got the heart of a champion his team down by seven this crowd has come to life the Ravens trail by seven Dalton's past the point to AJ Green on first down we go down to Dana Jamison you know guys we saw great leadership from Steve Smith on the defensive and they're obviously missing their key leader and Terrell Suggs out for the season with that Achilles injury it's one of the things off the field that people probably didn't think about who's going to give that pregame speech in the locker room we were told last week it was Chris Canty and so far this week long as the word although dooms was recommended for James Elvis do Manila for says Giovanni Bernard has taken down will be third down four Williams early coming to life in this second half another tackle and it's a situation that were but since anything needs to make a play right here hey Jay green at the bottom of your screen Barnard up the middle the Ravens defense with a big stand and they forced Cincinnati into a three and out which is the first time today the Bengals have gone three and out well you look back at this game as you see this really a it's an illconceived play to go for it to call on a third and three against this defense in this moment with this momentum going on for Baltimore getting back to red zone trips that come up empty for the Bengals one touchdown big play by Steve Smith and all the sudden they went from a ball out to sensi to a 7 point game with Baltimore having momentum he'll go to punt campanero back to pur Baltimore good kick by Hubert driving campanero Pinero up to the 35 yard line 20 yard return Ravens down seven a week three continues later today on CBS and for some of you on Fox and then tonight with Sunday Night Football on NBC tune in tomorrow from Monday Night Football on ESPN here in Baltimore for 25 to go third quarter the Ravens trail 14 to 7 with Steve Beuerlein Steve Tasker and Dana Jacobson I'm Andrew catalon and thank you for joining us for week three of the NFL on CBS go to use check illegal block there is a flag down at the 32 yard line Carlos Dunlap was in pursuit of that and came out and clipton personal foul unnecessary roughness blindside ha hit to the head number 53 offense 15yard penalty that's the first time I have ever seen that called on an offensive lineman on a defensive lineman left of your screen Souta comes in to the head of Dunlap you can't do that outside the tackle box plus you can't do it when you're coming back towards your own the goal alone it's called a peel back block it's a rule change and a point of emphasis this year that's going to be called more times than not but it should be called all time now so it's the first in 25 Flacco to fourset Texas made it to 24 and we're going to go back to New York and NFL today update which Abyan tony gonzalez andrew this guy has been mister durable yeah it has jb mark Behrens gonna come in here he's gonna get tripped up certainly not nothing like a dirty hit but it goes low on Ben Roethlisberger he gets carted off the field getting word now that he will not return for this game hopefully this is not a serious injury but that's devastating to the Pittsburgh juice Andrew Steve Steve and Dana and guys keep in mind on Thursday night a short week for the Steelers the host Baltimore on CBS and NFL Network go have some time done sit down of course completes not only that ben roethlisberger is a big force in this division that cheese two teams are very interested in that injury and how it's going to affect that'll have ripple effects all the way not only through this division but certainly it'll be felt in Pittsburgh's ability to get to the playoffs without there's a quarterback who's won two Super Bowls well let's wait and see what a half what the injury is but if it is legit a significant injury that changes the whole complexity of this division and the conference they FC you think about Baltimore being able if they could come back to win this game all of a sudden with Ben Roethlisberger out the division becomes within their grasp well now they have a third in 21 that's a primary focus flag down nice catch by Marlon brown white out to stick Alexi with the flag is back at the 21 yard line and Carlos Dunlap is saying it's against the Ravens there's no payoff the holding of number 72 first down well they threw a flag for some reason what a great throwing catch right there Marlon brown right as he's stepping out of bounds at ball throwing right on the money right at the sticks that's very high level execution we haven't seen a lot of that today out of Baltimore but it was a good time to show up now they're gonna take a good hard look at the spot and they may pull the sticks off to measure this right there well the near side of the field has not moved to change the far side of the field hats will see where the spot is and where it should be heat comes out and that's just past the 45 yard line and the now the the thing you see that the little marker on the ground there it's always put further than the change so that the players always go to that marker they know they're well past the chain so that changed the marker do you see out laying on the ground there as he went out of bounds is not accurate and it is a first down big conversion on third and long third and 21 you know some Harlan Brown it's kind of interesting you see they picked up a third and 21 it kind of deflate your defense but your defense got him into third and 21 you got to feel good about your defense they've converted a fourth down play for a touchdown and a third and 21 so the defense is still playing well Taliaferro inner running back he gets to carry here across the 45 to the 47 yard line just the second carry today for Taliaferro who's listed as questionable with a foot bruise don't you agree with that Steve I mean yeah I mean you got if you kind of forget how well your defense is playing because Baltimore has done a couple of things Baltimore's starting to make a few plays now no doubt about it but they're there in those situations like you said and they've Cincinnati has done a great job putting them in no situation but you gotta close a deal yeah but that is not a high percentage way no in a football game Blanco's gotten to the Arawa here in the second twofifty the first down again this was very well defended and this was a designed screen pass out to the left side you can see right there Taliaferro swims actually was at just a little flair passed to him outside Joe Flacco just kept giving ground Taliaferro did a great job making towards we think he'll miss they were in position to make that tackle and that's been as characteristic of this insanity defense early in the season first guy to the ball has made the tackle when he stopped doing that your defense doesn't look so good is a third down and three foot Baltimore inside ten minutes to go third quarter flick away to the shotgun two on the play clock takes the snap pressure coming back though steps up fires this play is made by Justin Forsett who cut it all out blitz coming from the right side you're going to see Justin Forsett come across the formation and pick up that block right there that gives Joe Flacco the time to make an unbelievable throw to Steve Smith but if forset isn't on every little detail of his assignment he sleeps for one second Joe Flacco is in that balls coming out Baltimore goes to the ground up cool set holiness number 53 10yard penalty what's up sheriff is Utah well let's go down to Dana Jacobson got guys who just saw Steve Smith with that reception before he went out for that series he was on the sideline walked up to the garbage can put a towel over his head it was there for about 30 seconds when he came up some water in the mouth spit it out and headed back out not sure what happened but you can guess yeah you have to guess we're pretty sure nine catches 138 yards and a touchdown for Steve Smith senior now in his 15th year his final year penalty makes it first in twenty those screen stops Brandon Thompson fourth year man out of Clemson is not fooled on that play where you just when you watch this Cincinnati defense they are not fooled by much now they're not many times when you're gonna see guys running free down the field they're always in position they're always very assignments sound right they're a great example that was a cute little screen pass Thompson was not fooled at all and they just ran five new bodies onto the field into their front seven a hook with a bunch of new pass rushers fresh pass rushers and a new package in the secondary there that's gonna be spell trouble for this offensive line play the third quarter flat collecting teeth and it's incompletes akin the intended target Adam Jones got a hand on that one Reggie Nelson couldn't get up to get this it could have been us interception Killer against the bagels automatic first down to close out a wild third quarter at the fourth quarter eatin Baltimore and here's what happened on the final play the third quarter crisp cooked the crisp Carter comes off the edge and you'll watch you can't see it at the end of this play right here but Carter's rushing there against Hurst and you'll see it from from this other angle that we have you'll see why they call the blow to the head he reaches up and hits Joe Flacco right there in the jaw and that's the penalty no doubt about it Joe Flacco and Baltimore got away with a couple of things there one that was a little bit of a careless throw into triple coverage down the field but to come out of it with a first down it should have been picked off Reggie Nelson had him headed his eye on it and he jumped too soon it didn't timed the jump during the quarter break Baltimore is exercising the option they have on a defensive foul in which time expires in a quarter to extend the quarter for one play please put that John Harbaugh wants to go back to the other side of the field while I think it's an extra play so that he needs an extra play it's an untimed down and that's a smart smart thing to do not it just shows you John Harbaugh his lights are on he gets an extra play out of this game at a game when he's trailing this is a play that doesn't count and at the end of the game when you need that extra play just made yeah the one that actually fits it in exactly right defensive penalty on the last play of the quarter for very very very astute decision by John Harbaugh so this is part of the third quarter now first and ten from the 23 yard line this will be an untimed down and then they'll just switch ends in the end this series will continue as normal Aiken goes in motion on first and 10 gonna throw it back and it's caught by Boyle breaks a tackle and second catch of Nick Boyle's career Adam Jones missed to tackle and it goes for a gain of 13 the Nick Boyle 6 for 270 pounds that's a hard man for Adam Jones to bring down almost outweighed by a hundred pounds so now the third quarter is officially over and we'll go to the other side of the field for the final quarter Cincinnati ahead 14 to 7 Ravens trying to avoid an O and three start they have never been owned three here's what's happened when the Ravens have started Owen they have missed the playoffs all three times best they did was 99 when they went on to finish eighth and eight first time under John Harbaugh they've started Owen and so many things become out of your control when you put yourselves in a hole like this are arguably you look at what's going on around the division what Ben Roethlisberger is gonna affect this division maybe that opens up thing who knows but the bottom line is you put yourself at a very big disadvantage to start the fire quarter black out to Smith I pushed out by a Jayhawk we watch the Ravens run this play in practice on Friday they couldn't get it right here Steve Smith right here he's going to come in and loop around and it's just him one on one with Adam Jones they could not get it right they tried it a couple of times finally and at the end of it when they when they mess it up for the third time Jim Harbaugh said hey everything's gonna go perfect on game day and they just left it a local and here we see it today and it we've got him inside the five Taliaferro in it running back on second and going to China Pharaoh this room is right forward man Taliaferro is taken down at the tune now we have an injured Raven and that his Steve Smith senior you heard Dana Jacobson a short time ago report that was a little shaken up on the sidelines yeah he actually was will say he got sick in the in the trash can and now there you know you can tell what they're doing there looks like he got a cramp yeah that's classy they're stretching his calf muscle out we'll see if he can continue might need to go in and get an IV third and goal when we come back Steve Smith getting an IV on the sidelines he'll sit out this third and goal play don't know if I've ever seen that before no the sideline Taliaferro next to plateau plateau throws Campanella on a great technical meet by Leon Hall the veteran with a big stop and exports and goal and John Harbaugh is gonna send out his kicker Justin Tucker you just got you got to earn every single inch against this defense you I mean you really do you cannot fool them kamar Aiken is trying to get a block on a halt he can't do it hall works off the block gives up the field to tackle campanero this is a great stand by Cincinnati in there let's face it 69 he's really a little bit now Baltimore's got all the momentum there right back in this football game gonna go down by 4 points if this field goal is good things have really changed here after halftime a 21 yard attempt for Tucker who has now made 34 in a row 50 yards it's 14 to 10 in favor your weekend starts with Thursday night football when Joe Flacco and the Ravens take on the Steelers will they app and Roethlisberger James Brown say and he was carted off the field in st. Louis Baltimore in Pittsburgh Thursday on CBS and NFL Network is we go down to Dana Jacobson all right guys you're talking about Steve Smith news behind me getting an IV right now before the end of the third quarter he actually came to the sideline took and he took some water and said to the doctors on the sideline I'm okay I'm okay but they went started preparing the IV so when he went down in the game they were all set and ready to go for him back to you all right Dana ten catches last week 10 again this week for Steve Smith senior and John Harbaugh told him that has to be conscious of how often they use Steve Smith at 36 years of age but what a day it's been hard to take them off the field well you look at what happened last year came out of the block hot one of the leading first eight weeks of the season he did kind of disappear the second half though they do have to be very conscious of that a touchback buck it's also one of the issues you think about with this Raven team their rosters some of their key players do have some miles and they need there's there's some young players on this roster that really has a lot of potential Crockett Gilmore would be a great example of that but also they need some of these young players to start stepping up and filling the void he lose a rain lewis you lose a head read you lose a terrell suggs in this season they've had great depth in the past but now they need that dip to become frontline and it hasn't done it yet cincinnati has seven cattle trying to get ground game trap 13:27 to go jeremyhill that's a big mall but it's good tough sledding against this Baltimore run defense in the second half back to New York and NFL today update with JP head Tony Gonzalez Atlanta has exploded yeah they were down 14 points to begin of this game but they've come back in a big way Devonta Freeman a big reason for that he takes from seven yards out three touchdowns on the day for him Julio Jones also has nine catches 143 yards 32:28 Atlanta over down Andrew catalon all right guys no mana trying to get to three no year second and seven Dalton out of the shotgun though sideline Jones makes the catch was he in he wants nice catch by Marvin Jones that's his fourth of the game they still had to come back a long way down the sideline to make this grab it was going to be a first down but the ball bite from Dalton way back down the stem of this route you see how far he has to come back down towards the football he has passed the first down launcher but it ended up only being a fiveyard game to seven steps away from Jumonville he's gonna keep it himself dice forward and depending on this spot that appears to be good for a first down it is yeah he just said to cross the 30 that is another great play by Andy Dalton good coverage by Baltimore off the field and he don't looks around goes through his progressions feels a little pressure and he's more than athletic enough to go down there and no slide there whatsoever he's getting the first down that's a gutsy play by anybody they're showing a replay on the video board and the Ravens players encourage Sun harbona throw a challenge flight because it appears that don't his knee may have been down well his name a ridge doubt his McNee may have been down but I don't think he was touched he's dead he's down there but see they're there he's touched and he's well past the 30 so this is a bad challenge Jimmy Smith was the most animated Raven imploring John Harbaugh to throw that red flag there was a slide if it was beat first it would be where the knee hit but he went headfirst won't man he could get up and run if nobody touches him so that ball it definitely is spotted in the right spot yeah they spotted it very close to the right spot and it was well past the line there's no way but this is going to be overturned I think it's a bad challenge and it's gonna cost him a time out of the game they're trailing I think that you know they're in a comeback mode no question their backs are against the wall and they're desperate but right here this is where their emotions got the best of them a little bit he's at the 31 at least for that first down that's that well past the line yeah I think that spots a little too generous but I think it's a 31 yard line we're in Baltimore here fourthquarter 1142 to go Cincinnati jumped out to a 14nothing lead Baltimore has scored 10 unanswered and John Harbaugh is challenging the spot of this last third down run by Andy Dalton the Steve Beuerlein Steve Tasker and Dana Jacobson I'm Andrew catalon our entire NFL on CBS crew first challenged this season by John Harbaugh and if he's wrong it'll cost him a timeout now here's the thing they may rese pot this football back to the 31 yard line where we think but it won't be past the line to gain so they'll still lose their time out our officiating expert Mike Carey back in New York Mike what did you see on this play a number of things first we ignore the knee down because he's going headfirst you also ignore the touch by the Baltimore flare with on his his a put his rag that does not count but then the hand touches on the calf you freeze that play there where the ball is it looks like right at the 31 yard line they'll spot it there and they'll see if that makes the first entering the play the ruling on the field is confirmed it is a first down going headfirst and on the ground is not damn the ball is not dead until he's first touched by a defensive player which was beyond the 30yard line so John Harbaugh loses the challenge and loses a timeout in the process the ball should be spotted a little bit closer to the 31 yard line though I believe if they're really trying to get this a hundred percent correct you'll see there's his knees down there and that's where it shouldn't down into this CR yeah but it does not change the first man Cincinnati now 8 of 12 converting third downs today its first in 10 Giovanni No at the 27yard line bowling number 61 that's on the centre Russell Bodine and that image right the hair of the flag on the ground something we've seen a lot of today there have now been 20 penalties in this game right there as you'll see it right in the middle of the line Bodeen latched on to Brandon Williams Williams could not get away 1 anytime the offensive llama gets his hands outside that framework did you see where we 19 penalties 8 against the against the Ravens first in 20 Talton to Bernard trying to spin away from CJ Mosley but Mosley makes the stop and now there's an injured Bengal behind the play and that is Kevin Ziegler the right guard out of Wisconsin and some pain on the ground we're back in a moment back in Paramore 10:50 to go second and 18 for the Bengals Eric win sitting at right guard to the injured Kevin Ziegler taught the speedy pass is deflected and incomplete Carl Davis got a hand on that one it's third and long for Cincinnati this play was set up very nice and you're gonna see Tyler I four right here at the top he comes back on one of these screen passes again set up perfectly they cannot get the ball completed semantics dolls got to get that ball to him you see all this green grass out here that's a big game if they can just complete that little pass that so whose responsibility over I don't care cycler is back in at wake guard only missed one point move down the line so did soda Jones and now there's 20 penalties in the game after a false start against Aaron so did so did Marvin Jones both those guys move Jones was disgusted with himself i firt knows he was wrong when as he was very quiet and here in the first half actually hurt some blue birds from the whole past puffing quiet about the Raven and they're just gonna run it with Giovanni Bernard and here comes the punt team for Cincinnati with ten and a half minutes to go yeah Cincinnati hamstrung themselves with penalties on that drive they made some plays but couldn't get out of their own way but I'm telling you they would have picked up at least enough for the first down on that screen pass that was there it was the right call there was a block there were two or three blockers downfield they will in perfect position that pass has got to be completed to pick up that first down third punt for Kevin Kugler campanero back deep for the Ravens this one drives him back to the 23 yard line six yard line nine 57 to go Flacco and the Ravens down 54 Steve Smith senior needed an IV on the sidelines on that last Drive he's back out for this Drive first intend with 9:57 to go in the fourth quarter Justin Forsett wrapped up by Michael Johnson well this is where the Bengals feel they have an advantage they are so deep on the defensive line and they rotate guys throughout the whole game and we spoke with Carlos Dunlap last night at the Cincinnati hotel and he said I feel so fresh in the fourth quarter because last year there were games where I had 80 snaps this year it's almost half of that and let's see if it pays off here for the Bengals in the fourth quarter Johnson coming it's top low it's incomplete Michael Johnson applying pressure and it's third down you know Andrew that is a great call because you talk about that that's that's a huge point at this point of all you watch the right side of the screen there coming off the edge Michael Johnson he's fresh they have literally today they've got eight guys active that they're rotating in that front line that front for Baltimore only has five guys my defensive lineman active today so that depth really pays off late the ball game yeah that's been something that's not covered them in years past but with the rotation these guys really are fresh oh snap Flacco fires incomplete in the direction of Williams and Marlon brown and a good defensive stand there by Cincinnati they force a three and out I think you're a hundred percent right though and who those a great called and pointing that out because the freshness the quarterback can sense that believe me if they're coming faster more more speed around the edge you can feel them coming and that force to get rid of that ball a little quicker fourth punt today for

if I'm the Bengals I'm trying to stay on the field offensively get first downs where the run pass by hook or by crook you've got to stay on the field offensive ly here for since for the Bengal 9:04 to go it's Bernard trying to use his speed alone across the 25 yard line before Williams makes the tackle that was the best run they've had in this second half and it was just a little nondescript right up between the tackles they've got to continue that the Bengals that guy keeps a run game involved even though here in the second half it's been almost nonexistent still handing the football off really keeps that Baltimore defense that bad keeps it from teeing off on Daulton Bernard got four at second and six leading for a first down tackle meet from behind by Jimmy Smith but a gain of 14 for AJ Green and that's what we're gonna see more of I think for the rest of the game out of Cincinnati they're gonna try and mix the run with the short pass they're gonna try and get it quick they've got some very very it's very difficult for Baltimore to commit to stop in the run and expect one of their corners to cover AJ Green one on one he's little bumped up right there but I think he'll be back in there gonna try and create the oneonone matchups by staying committed to the running game keep an eye on AJ Green his catch makes it posted check back to the ground for Cincinnati and Bernard on the carry we've seen more of him than Jeremy hill here in the second half he'll at the two fumbles last week against the Chargers we spoke to Hill on yesterday he sat down he acknowledged fort responsibility for those fumbles B said you know what mistakes happen in football but it's how you respond to those mistakes that really make or break your career and that was a really wise answer from a young football player he knew that he had to bounce back from a bad week fumbling to balls and make up to that court team mates and certainly he is starting to do that today and that circle you just saw AJ Green back in the game at the bottom of your screen captain pump fakes to green now looking deep person ooh thanks Laura and on that one Wow this is a throw that Andy Dole would like to have back is it good coverage by Lordaeron screen sure but if that ball is out front that that ball is throw the Lord supposed to be thrown to Mohamed Sanu is open that ball has got to be thrown out in this area way up here in front of everybody let you receive a chance to go get it over the top there's no safety back there has got to make that throw and seven Nicole fourth quarter Shige nosering for CJ Mosley comes off the backside elvis do Merville comes off the backside Mosley gets up in Moses as we said earlier in the game he's got an elite linebacker speed and with half a field to go you're not going to get him even there Bernard tries to go in and get him just before he gets in has no shot at it and you look back to the three points that the Bengals left on the field right at the end of halftime trying to go for a fourth and short to get it in and coming up with nothing those three points loom large right now yep you think Marvin Lewis regrets not going for three right now you have a tie ballgame instead of now bidding position where you have to come from behind to win a game Elvis to Miraval had a quiet start to the season only four tackles in the post two games that's his first sack of the year it comes at a huge time and for the first time this season Cincinnati it's opponent 17 Hut answer points for the Baltimore Ravens hey Levi Tory two hours ago there were some boos here in Baltimore not anymore Elvis to Miraval with his first sack of the season Andy Dalton fumbled and CJ Mosley took it back for a touchdown Baltimore with 17 unanswered points as they try to avoid an O and three start Justin Tucker will kick it away Brandon Tate back deep for the Bengals another tech smack perk sucker as we go back to the touchdown well here is Elvis dummkopf he's gonna roll it straight up off the edge we're going to talk about the Holton let's let it run for a second here and see why Andy don't have nowhere to go with this football he has three receivers going out which means he's got eight guys blocking those guys are all covered right there and he'd always got to protect the football but the protection on the outside was the key Elvis do Merville the best pass rusher for the Baltimore Ravens was one on one on a tight end yeah Tyler Eifert was trying to block Elvis do Miraval now granted the ball should have been out before it was in a normal situation but the coverage made the fact he got that matchup Elvis do Merville couldn't couldn't finally got home there's an injured Raven in the end zone and that appears to be Nick coil the tight end at a Delaware it is and he has helped off the field in turn on that special teams play on the touch back of the kickoff boy who today has two catches the first two catches of his career big day for the Blue Hens of Delaware is Flacco of Delaware who's able to hook up with Boyle who was a fifth round pick out of Delaware this year first NFL injury gets hurt on a touchback well I think it's just too much to ask you're tight in the block the best pass rush going on well you got eight blockers in there yeah there's seven protecting Dalton you see right right there we Nestle it gets him to run deep but now the Bulls got to be gone there's no way you're gonna expect him hold him off it's um it's unfair protection to a head cold and they paid the price sango's gotta protect the ball though let's see how cincinnati does playing from first time this season they've trailed they're slowest in the last 35 minutes here today dalton throws a jade green 253 off to the races still going down six in at least 80 yards what an answer by Delta to the pinkles wow what a great how about that protection with solid Dalton's got the nice pocket little bit of pressure but puts an absolute strike on AJ green up the seam and then pure guts and will from AJ Green to finish that thing I'll get at the end zone taste generally speaking about the Bengals that's the kind of play they have lacked exactly last for you they didn't have a guy that would steps and say you're not gonna win this game we're not gonna lay down the Bengals have a reputation for being frontrunners not very good when the chips are down that right there says just the opposite Moochie to the extra point and it's good AJ Green nine catches 220 yards his careerhigh is 224 how about this Cincinnati didn't trail for the first 173 minutes of the season they trailed for 8 seconds and now they're back in front as we look at our game summary well it's been a wild day here in Baltimore Andy Dalton got the Bengals on the board first with this rushing touchdown Joe Flacco an interception a path robot Flacco nicked off by Adam Jones it led to this touchdown from Dalton to Marvin Jones 14 nothing Cincinnati put up fourth and 5 Flacco to Steve Smith senior for a 50yard touchdown that made it 14 to 7 and at moments ago CJ Mosely cooked up the loose ball to get Baltimore to lead however what an answer here as we go back to the touchdown just a seam route then he said two guys down on the numbers two guys down doulton picks the best matchup and AJ Green is always a good choice AJ green in his last three games against Baltimore is averaged 214 yards giving John Harbaugh nightmares and today nine catches 220 yards for the fifth year man out of Georgia Andy Dalton over 300 yards passing now 303 on the day for Dalton and now let's see if so Flacco and the Ravens can respond again in danger of falling to own three for the first time in franchise history Campanella otoko the 20 well you're gonna see a few things when you look back at this touchdown here's AJ Green right here in the slot all he's gonna do is run straight up we'll excuse me that is gonna run straight up the numbers right past the corner which is kinder clueless actually have to cover him but the safety in the middle of the field will Hill is the one that has to be over there to make that play because that ball is being thrown right here and it is on the money perfectly thrown by Andy Dalton the timing was there the call was there what a great play go on Thurston max will you mr. whoopee Titan close to midfield a gain of 27 and we're seeing now in the second half I mean the first half was dominated by Cincinnati but now you see the division familiarity with both of these teams come out neither team is getting fooled but they're getting the matchups they won and he got guys now with both defenses playing hard trying to make some things happen they're leaving some gaps in the second a black going supple and throws it away it was Carlos Dunlap coming with the pressure Cincinnati wants intentional grounding they might get it they're talking it over this ball has to make it past the line of scrimmage when Joe Flacco lets it goes you see Dunlop trying to get an animal battle if it does or not it's gentle grounding number five offense 10yard penalty second down not only does it need to be the line of scrimmage there's got to be a receiver in the area well I want it to avoid the sack nobody in the area yeah no question who died you can always make a case that there's one of those guys down there Steve Smith was raising his hands inside the shield at the end of this play but as he retreats from Dunlop tries to get rid he's thrown at the other direction and there you see fourth set was down but he was to the right of the Shiva Flacco threw it to the other side that's a good call by the official not tomorrow over a hundred yards in penalties Steve Smith senior makes the catch here that's his 11th of the ball game but it'll be third down but this Baltimore this play right here is indicative of the second half the Bengals have played good defense they got him down a third and 11 but the difference is Ben Baltimore has found a way to stay on the football field on third and long they've converted a couple and they've got a couple byby penalty now look for Joe Flacco now being the shotgun he's going to find the guy I think if you're the Ravens and how they've done it they're gonna throw a short pass and try to get the guy to run for the first and third down back to his means twelve cats today for Steve Smith senior there is nothing that frustrates the defense more than the be in position to make the play right there's Leon Hall you forget how strong one of the smallest guys on the field is though the explosiveness of Steve Smith and the size of his heart always ends up making good things happen what an incredible two weeks for Steve Smith senior coming off the big game last week in Oakland another one today he gets a breather up push down and Marlon brown dropped the pass this is one of the things about Baltimore you got a guy like Steve Smith you got Joe Flacco you've got these veteran guys who are trying to make Blasi you got these young guys coming up they're not there yet and at some point they're depending on these young right now the tight ends for the young tight ends for Baltimore have come through pretty well but these young wide receivers have not Shaco facing pusher and that mess there sitting is complete to Justin Forsett wow that was a that was a desperation I did saved by two yards you'd rather not have that thing completed yeah back at the line of scrimmage yeah a few Turman it's four sets should have batted this to the ground yep that was that was a combination of things right there I saw Rick Wagner get beat but they Joe Flacco missed the blitz I believe well if this ball hits the ground you might want to look lucky ball raise it up shoes it up off this shoe if that ball hits the ground yeah Baltimore right review it so that they can get an incomplete pass and get the ball back up at the line of scrimmage that's the right call right now a loss of seven if it's incomplete it would be third and ten as opposed to third and 17 it's not very often you see your own team challenge it completely passed of a completed pass behind the line of scrimmage yeah they don't want this pass to be completed and that's weird this was the rights the right call right once again John Harbaugh shows he's he's you know he's thinking and this is a great challenge for him cuz you're hoping that we've got a shot that this ball hits the ground with four sent right there well let's see if it's a great challenge because if he's wrong he's now lost two challenges his half you'd only have one timeout left the rest of the way but I'm just saying if we show clearly that the ball hits the ground is the correct challenge we that's I thought we had a clear angle of it but we made oh yeah there's a ground ball hits the ground so it is a correct challenge the question is can we establish that in buta blue let's take a look right here right there the ball is on the ground and he scoops it up that is an incomplete past great challenge by Harbaugh they'll turn this into a third and 10 rather than a third and 16 and yeah that's crucial you got to do it John Harbaugh has done a couple of things today as head coach that have really been sharp one the play at the inch at the third quarter where they got an untimed down on a defensive penalty was one the fake punt was another although it didn't turn into a great thing it was also the right play and they made the first down and now here he does the challenge now they did have a silly challenge early when their emotions got the best of them on the scramble by Andy Dalton but this is a good challenge 402 to go Baltimore the only active team never to start the season oh and three Joe Flacco told us on Friday that he dislikes the bengals more than the pittsburgh steelers say we shouldn't be losing to them we need to play our game and beat them got that edge during the play the ball hit the ground the pass is incomplete it'll be and at the 36 yard line please put 444 on the game clock Baltimore's not charged with the time out for this challenge however because of the early or unsuccessful challenge Baltimore is out of challenges for the remainder of the game this Wars matter after 2 minutes and 34 seconds because you can't challenge inside 2 minutes anyway so a big win there for Harbaugh still has to two timeouts but it doesn't change the fact that Flacco and the Ravens still face 3rd down and 10 right here now again once again they have thrown the short pass tried to break a tackle with Steve Smith to get the first down you've got to think the Bengals are thinking that as well get the short pass but make the tackle tires campanero pension first down with his first catch of the day there's one of the young guys coming through for Joe Flacco on the top of your screen coming underneath the clearing out route up Aiken catches it two hands on the ball and fights for the first down on the linebacker nice throw and catch and that was four down territory though as well so if they did get come up a little bit short they were going to go for it on fourth down clock is running for ten to go playaction to college max Williams his second round pick out of Minnesota this is one play where max Williams is right here on the end of the line of scrimmage they do a great job with the playaction fake hard to the right side and good execution this is one time they actually fooled the Cincinnati Bengals you see the great job by Flacco getting the ball over the top out in the open space great play gain of nine so it's second and one while there are some contact in the end zone there's no flag though and that was another spot where you go to the guy that you can count on and that's Steve Smith you'll see watch if they get tangled up they're both pushing and shoving no call which is unbelievable in the game with 20 penalties the Steve Smith senior makes the catch well Cincinnati's Bryan foul and Baltimore sin no way incidental doesn't matter but there are some times that's going to be called and that's the frustrating part for these coaches you know that the consistency of the call is very very hard explain Justin Tucker on to the extra point good Steve Smith senior 36 years old he has 13 catches for 186 yards and two touchdowns and we told you earlier at his longtime wide receivers coach from Carolina Richard Williamson died this week of a heart condition at the age of 74 he meant a lot to Steve Smith in his career and while is Smith having a big ball game today there's the matchup at the top of the screen there's really nothing to it both these players run down the sidelines like they've done a hundred times before and they both just start grabbing each other and the ball is right at the pylon to the back shoulder of Steve Smith and if Kirkpatrick limps back at it maybe he could have swiped it away but it's hard to do that when your hardest Eason you're not going to take your eyes off him that's a throw that has worked on as much as any throw in the NFL for quarterbacks and receivers that that back shoulder throw it's not called very often because you don't know what kind of coverage you're going to get the receiver and the quarterback have to both adjust at the same time look at those numbers wow that's some big fantasy numbers right there both those guys are putting up and coming through for their teams more importantly he's going to have the last laugh those that's that's the big question is it going to be a che green or Steve Smith senior plenty of time on the clock steeps it was AJ Green a moment ago Steve Smith answered him with that touchdown right there and now with 241 to car 356 to go AJ Green is going to get a chance and another touch back for Justin Tucker these two teams have play a couple of wild games in Baltimore recently two years ago AJ Green for a miracle Hail Mary to send the game to overtime but in oot Justin Tucker won it for the Ravens 20 to 17 and in the season opener last year AJ Green again caught a bomb from Andy Dalton his time for 77 yards as the bay 1:23 2:16 joe flacco 13 in warren and september home games the only loss was here last year to the Penguins what a great rivalry here in the AFC North and now Cincinnati down by 30 Felton fire sidelines AJ Green out of bounds incomplete and NFL today update in New York here's Jay P and Tony Gonzalez Tony take a look at this twopoint conversion attempt yeah that's Dalton followed right there he goes up there there's nothing there he's just trying to make a play at this point they're gonna swarm they're gonna stop him they missed the twopoint conversion Indy looks like they're gonna take this one 35 33 still got 47 seconds left on anything can happen all right back to empty catalog all right guys 350 ten steps up to a legal rush now throws on the run back Bernard Giovanni Bernard down the sidewalk and finally stepped out of bounds a gain of 23 and that quiets the crowd momentarily here in Baltimore often times you forget about what a good athlete Andy Dalton is he's made a couple of nice runs today but look at his presence and his poise in the PAS he feels pressure steps right lose left feels a defender coming to him it has hit buildings deliver a strike on the outside for a nice game to Giovanni Bernard Cincinnati has all three timeouts remaining 338 to go salt insists anew makes the catch at the 37 could find some room in the Baltimore territory before Daryl Smith brought him down a gain of 19 when I think right now with that gain of 19 you're gonna go pace they're gonna go no huddle and keep the pressure on this defense for the Ravens you want to get that pass rush and take the starts right out of it these guys you got their hands on their hips they're tired keep after them and keep throwing the football dolphin clicking teeth cajones cortex Dylan's inside 210 Marvin Jones using is6 to free to talk and get that one a pickup of 31 well these right over the top of Kyle Erikson and what can you say about the guy stepping up and making plays quarterbacks making throws receivers making catch catches against good coverage yes he's super play these are playmakers we have not seen the Cincinnati Bengals put on the field AJ Greene's been there step but at women when it's been crunch time the Bengals have been notoriously Crum worse now they're getting it done and getting it done consistently Dalton's career high is 381 yards he's at 376 on first and goal bernard taken down by lauren sky and a timeout is called poor by John Harbaugh so the Ravens have one timeout remaining with 216 to go and the twominute warning Harbaugh wants to try to preserve as much time as possible to get the ball back to his offense he's begging for five more seconds to he doesn't think the timeout was called quick enough once again working every angle John Harbaugh this is also a point now in the red zone where the Bengals came up completely empty a couple of times today once at the end of the first half when they went through for it on fourth down another interception by Andy Dalton corner of the end zone trying to get it to AJ Green and couldn't get it done they've got to make good obviously on this red zone trip this is their last chance to win this football game but they are already in a position to tie it there's what's at stake for the Ravens they have not three in their team's history and nobody has played in a Super Bowl last team to go Owen Curry and make the playoffs the 1998 oil mills 216 to go its second and goal right here man the man that we're going to call him back in that was a matchup they didn't like three on the play clock Talton out of the shotgun fires for the endzone to green and he's got it touchdown Cincinnati the second of the day for AJ Green while the Cincinnati Bengals have answered and answered again what a game for AJ Green and Andy Dalton right on the money on that play AJ Green set a new career high with 227 yards and Andy Dalton on that place at a new careerhigh hit 383 yards passing you cannot make enough of what has happened both sides today this one team answers the other one answers back in the worst thing for Cincinnati right now is it Baltimore's to us two minutes and ten seconds ruff vertical extra point to force the Ravens touchdown and Newton is true Baltimore has one timeout left end the twominute warning what incredible game here in Baltimore today Cincinnati jumped out to a 14 nothing lead Baltimore responded with 17 straight points but it's been back and forth ever since in this fourth quarter and now Joe Flacco will hope to get the last laugh as Baltimore tries to avoid an Owen three start there you see marc trestman talking with Joe Flacco trying to plot what that they can go to in that vast playbook the hat that cincinnati hasn't already seen or will it give them the best chance to be successful marc trestman the fourth offensive coordinator that Joe Flacco has worked with over the last two years I mean he start back with the Super Bowl with Cam Cameron then then of course last year with gary kubiak who Kubiak was a run game guy trestman is a run as a passing game guy we'll see they're gonna throw the football here but here you go there have been four touchdowns in the last four minutes and 39 seconds Cincinnati led 14 nothing at the half Andy Dalton finally threw his first interception and also fumbled but credit to the Cincinnati offense led by Dalton with 383 yards passing to put the Bengals back in front as they try to get to three no for the second straight year it will be a touchback so Baltimore will start this drive at the 20 they have to go 80 yards with one timeout and the twominute warning plenty of time here for Joe Flacco and company to to get after it and of course you want to make yards and chunks if you can but there is no pressure to try and force the ball up the field right now you got all kinds of time yeah well all kinds of time but you don't have all kinds of timeouts you've got one timeout and the twominute warning you're gonna have I think you go no huddle and at this point of course the run game is still a factor that you're gonna have to tour the football with judge black and that pass is caught by Max Williams and that will take us to the twominute warning can Baltimore avoid an ode three start for the first time in franchise history two minutes to go you're watching the NFL on CBS Bengals lead by four two minutes to go here in Baltimore Dalton on set a plateau rather on second and three that pass not able to be reeled in by Steve Smith Ravens the only active team never to start Owen three the last Owen three team to make the playoffs the 98 bills when Joe Flacco was in eighth grade critical third down here for Baltimore although clearly four down territory one timeout left for the Ravens please Steve Smith senior had a step on Reggie Nelson not able to connect with black on its fourth and three that's the throw that Joe Flacco has to make I mean he was under pressure Cincinnati was bringing it with those fresh defensive linemen but Steve Smith did have a step Joe Flacco's patient and good enough to make that throw well we've seen it all day if Joe Flacco is backing up and doesn't set his feet or is in any way it has to do it in a weird notion of just flip it he struggles to the liberal Ravens five for five on four times this year pressure coming Luka to see it there is a flag down back to the line of scrimmage if it's against the Bengals it will go for a first down personal foul grabbing the facemask number 72 offense half the distance for the goal still fourth down against Collett co semele right there right here right there for every Vincent race he spread the clothes of his arm there it is right there you see the right hand inside honest Emily that's where the he was trying to block two guys got himself overextended and the one on the right right there was Vincent rave any ray right there you see the face mask right on the inside there so its fourth and second team go guys sometime feeling sick through on the near side of the field Marlon Brown had a step but Flacco was rolling right away from Marlon Brown tried to find max Williams and Cincinnati takes over with 135 to go and that is going to do it as Cincinnati will be able to kneel down on this with just one timeout for Baltimore Michael does a nice job trying to extend this play but obviously this is their last gasp effort you got to get the first down you got to complete this football you saw Flacco look in to his left he was looking at Marlon brown but running away from him Brown on the bottom of your screen calling for it right there neat and I think you'd be what you're saying there there and Steve Smith was breaking open it across the middle Joe Flacco just didn't at the time when he brought the time he didn't take the time to find the guy and just make sure he completed the pass he tried to hit the home run and it was the wrong decision yeah I think the safeties for Cincinnati as well we're thinking that Joe Flacco moving to his right is not going to be able to get the ball back across the field outside the Marlin Brown you see there's a safety of top of the screen still too we can't see him in he's out of but he was inside mark Brown was open but that's a throw that automotive and Joe Flacco committed so in the end with the Ravens call for thirteen penalties for 116 yards it's a penalty that essentially ends up losing in the game the penalty on assembly wiped out the first down completion to Steve Smith and John Harbaugh has used his final timeout with 53 seconds to go and frustration in the devastation of a Nolan three start you can see a written right on John Harbaugh face not that it's over yet but it pretty much is all things considered but a situation they've never been in here in Baltimore before what can you say about the Cincinnati Bengals Marvin Lewis and that that football team going to three and OH fantastic job fighting their way back in after trailing for the first time this season they came back and answered big a couple of times AJ Green from Andy Dalton huge on the part of Eagles players and coaching staff yeah it's almost the point now for the Cincinnati Bengals they're playing so good so early in the season you almost think that how can they keep it up for 15 more weeks and stick 40 more weeks not over yet Baltimore now out of timeouts most of the Raven faithful believe it it is pretty much hopeful in the help but your heart person right it crazier things have happened Dalton will hand off to preneur they're not inside the 10 and now it's brought down so if you're Marvin Lewis do you kick the field goal and you just try to run out the clock on fourth down well there's gonna be what 7 seconds this is 7 seconds left yeah I think you you don't risk the possibility of something bad happening on the kick of a walk of miss snap and going the other way I think you you just have your quarterback kill as much time as you can and get down well it'll fall down you what yeah I mean you've got these are special situations that happen about 1 in every 200 games well you've got that difference where you've got 6 seconds you're trying to kill usually you don't even mind taking the safety here you have Andy Dalton take it and run away from the defense for 6 seconds or a running back take it run away from the defense of 6 6 seconds and run out of bounds down the field you could do that as well I just don't know if they they risk in exchange of any story I don't think you hear that snap I think any dollar buy as much time as you can hopefully run out six seconds and if you can't Baltimore's got a throwing touchdown pass from 80 yards away right or plus you want to protect Dalton as well you don't want to have you know it's not going to take a hit the Ravens you know come in and take a free shot of the quarterback he's just trying to stand there and kill time so it'll be interesting to see how they do this the male is next Chicago and Seattle or Buffalo at Miami gonna give it to preneur and Giovanni Bernard still turning his legs typical need and the clock hits zero there we go Cincinnati hands to Ravens their third straight loss first time in franchise history that Baltimore has started this season oh and three and now a short week for the Ravens they'll take on the Steelers on Thursday Night Football about Cincinnati or you know in straight year coming up next in Chicago or Seattle or Buffalo against Miami Christy Tasker Steve Beuerlein Dana Jacobson this is Andrew catalon saying so long from

  "transcript": "back in Baltimore where it's a bit breezy today wind out of the east northeast to 12 miles per hour Joe Flacco has a 13 in one record in September home games which was news to Joe Flacco for more on that in the fourth member of our team Dana Jacobson yeah Joe actually laughs when I asked him about it said that he found out from a bottom line for all the number he cares about three three straight losses to this maddie van gogh's team uh team he was emphatic about saying he does not like in fact he dislikes them more than the steelers reason is simple they don't play well against them and he doesn't think they should lose to them you can start rewriting that script right now guys Danny told us Friday we shouldn't be losing to them we need to play our game it's a big one for the Ravens since 1990 only three teams who started Owen three have gone on to make the playoffs the last team to do it the 1998 Buffalo Bills when Joe Flacco was in eighth grade the Ravens win the toss they will receive and they will start the twenty after the touch back by Mike Nugent and here comes Joe Flacco who last week threw for 384 yards against the Raiders the third most of his career and the pressure squarely is on Joe Flacco especially early he made the comment as we said in the open that he believes his Bengals team is not as good from behind let's see how they start this game out the Ravens shift online for set starts at running back Flacco will look to club to Kyrie youth check on the cat field and he's tripped up at the 27 yard line by Adam Jones let's take a look at the Baltimore starting offense and for the second straight game James her starts at left tackle Eugene Monroe still out with a concussion and Steve Smith senior now in his 15th year coming off a 150 yard performance last week for a set on second down and he picks up the first Cincinnati defensively Carlos Dunlap leads the team with two and a half sacks to start the season finis ray made that big interception to seal the win against the Chargers last week and in the secondary he just made that previous tackle on first down Adam Jones now in his ninth year first and ten Flacco pump fakes gets what if it's batted up in the air and in completes till mata Peko got his big hand on that one it's second down we were talking to Joe Flacco he was adamant that they needed to get off to a fast start you got to think that he's exactly right this Bengals team you don't know if they don't play well from behind because they're never behind them trailers a point this season this is a team that Joe Flacco knows well both these clubs know each other Flacco was adamant they've got to get on the board early Dorset is stopped Geno Atkins who's been off to an incredible start this year makes the tackle yeah they the bangles when we talked to him in fact we talked yesterday Carl has done lap just raving about the level of play that Geno Jaquez brought to the table this year he's playing at a Pro Bowl level making a difference right there it showed itself and now by the way Baltimore looking at third long and just 25% on third downs this year that's 29th in the NFL with a big stick short of the first down marker well this is something that Marvin Lewis talks about and it shows up over time all these players and Steve you alluded to it in the open have been in this system for at least four or five years and they know their responsibilities they trust each other so much that was a great example right there this plane discipline defense giving up the short throw making the tackle Victorian whistle down at the 32 yard line by Brendon trolley Cincinnati football when we come back never miss a moment of football action with the CBS sports every play every story download the CPS sports app now the crowds going crazy here in Baltimore because Jonathan Ogden was just sown on the big scoreboard and now listening at the Baltimore offense can do against Andy Dalton in the Bengals on first down it's Jeremy Hill on the carry for Cincinnati what a start for Andy Dalton this year in his fifth year out of TCU is completion percentage 68% through the first two games five touchdown passes no interceptions for Dalton he has not been sacked either the only quarterback in the NFL without an interception and a set hailing they got first its second and nine and he is chased down by Lawrence guy who started today for the injured Christie he's an act of a look at the Bengals starting offensive on Andrew Whitworth yesterday agreed to a oneyear extension through next season and Tyler Eifert with three touchdowns in the first two games it's very happy to have we're back in the line in their offensive attack last year third and six looking deep down the sideline for Jones comes back and makes the catch waited Sussman by Marvin Jones for a gain of 42 just a double move on the outside you're going to see the pump fake by any dolmas safety just has knocked it over the top and that the you'll see right in the middle of field of the Ravens symbol there the safety does not get over the top to make the play and actually the corner spun around as well a great job by an adult and the receiver on the double move its apalta more defense that allowed 448 yards last week to Oakland offensive coordinator Dean P said it was hard to watch the tape of that one on first and ten tighten and he overthrows Mohamed Sanu it'll be second down yeah don't miss that throw and went right down the down this the seam and it just tossed it right over everybody had his man open and that's one of the things Dalton has got to do a better job of in' and let's face it as long as this happens okay that's a fiveyard penalty the illegal contact down the field is going to be first in ten 26 now but Andy Dalton is really the guy who everything is focused on for this for the Cincinnati team because he has taken so much heat over their playoff failures there's Jake Fisher who gonna pass last week for the Bengals the rookie offensive lineman split out wide when they give it to Hill inside and he's wrapped up at the 24 yard line we'd like to welcome those of you who were watching Pittsburgh and st. Louis and welcome you to Baltimore where the Ravens got the ball first had to punt and now Cincinnati driving with 10 30 to go in the first quarter on second and 8 Hill up the middle across the 20 into the red zone Cincinnati already with 10 Reds own possessions this year that's the most in the NFL this is number 11 that's a great example of why Cincinnati has had so much success offensively this year their front line is dominant they've been together a lot of years they're averaging over on first and second down there get themselves the Kurdish orcs all the time this is 32 on the ground again with man he's got the post down Jeremy Hill fumbled twice last week against the Chargers he sat on the bench for the last 22 minutes and that was a tough pill for him to take but Marvin Lewis said it's not an issue with Hill because he doesn't have a weak personality he said that fumbles are an issue for guys with weak personalities that's not Jeremy hill and they've trusted him already on this first drive with five carries you see those guys right there at that offensive line that has keyed all the successful Cincinnati Dalton Hill Bernard all have benefited from those guys up front insulted shapeliness a flag down green was out of bounds it's incomplete we'll see what Walt Anderson today's referee has and again for those expecting Pittsburgh and st. Louis we'll get to there just as quickly as possible part of the past the illegal hands hands from the face number 38 defense that's the second penalty on this Drive Melvin the quarterback in the on the nickel package got called and that's you talk about the little things that pile up to need to Owen to and that's what's happened to the Ravens it's been it's not so much that they play poorly but has been small little crucial things at different times that have allowed them to keep their permit on the field offensively or get off the field defensively again as soon as Pittsburgh st. Louis B pins so we will take you there right now and its first intend for Cincinnati from the 11 the give to Hill a flag is down in the secondary Hill across the 10 and maybe a gain of two on the play Lawrence guy makes the tackle but another flag down illegal formation offense number 18 that's a fiveyard penalty first down that's Jake Fisher they they like to use he's the draft pick out of Oregon caught a 31yard passed last week yeah he's a very talented offensive lineman Marvin Lewis of afraid trying create ways to get the ball to him in the passing game but when you get cute like that you got to make sure everybody's on the same page they got burned by it backs up the bangles five yards to the office hands ain't complete nearly intercepted by Courtney Upshaw he had it in his hands there those are the kind of opportunities you've got to take advantage of this ball it's going to pop right off the helmet of aj green right up in the air and watch Courtney Upshaw drops right on his helmet and he can't grab it either you've got to be aware that's why defenders spend so much time on tip drills but this was going to be a quick bubble screen AJ Green to try and make the athletic guy get you this break a tackle maybe get some positive yardage but Shawna's for Fiera has never had an interception that a golden opportunity there he'll never have a better chance with that one right there second and 15 850 to go in the first quarter and movement and flies that one who goes against the Bengals and again just as soon as Pittsburgh and st. Louis begins we will take you there you're on this direct down house second and 20 really what they're trying to do right here Cincinnati they're gonna try and at least get half of this yardage back right now Marvin Lewis's think a little bit less it's not do anything crazy and lose field goal position let's keep the ball maybe get half of it take one shot at the end zone on third down and then make sure we get the field goal but right now they just want to get part of this yardage back to give themselves a chance to hit the end zone Talton pump fakes over the middle to bloom another flag comes in James Reeb Lewis made a diving attempt at an interception the flag of the drive Walter Anderson busy an appearance number 33 they can that goes against will he'll who last week against the Raiders thought he had the game sealing interception but was called for holding and then Oakland went on to punched in the goahead touchdown well Tyler laughs Tyler Eifert kind of took the dive right there and kind of embellished what was going on so that gives Cincinnati a first down pay penalty Kayle at the middle again across the center to the 9 yard line and that's a huge huge penalty that you can't you can't state strongly enough how significant that is you know they were looking at second and 20 and Steve you were saying they were hoping to get back to have a chance at the end zone Andy Dalton threw the ball it could have been intercepted but instead they got first down now from the 10 12 yard line now looking at second a totally different situation Cincinnati first downs because of Colton or kennel tease already in his opening quarter it's the left side tackle by CJ Mosley the second year man out of Alabama it's third down yeah you're not gonna outrun CJ Mosley to the sidelines and no matter how good your running game is if Mosley is not block he's gonna get there and and you see his Hill tries to get there Mosley's just gonna marry by the NFL is the NFL linebackers be run as fast as running back does a great job by Moses soon as Pittsburgh in singular starts we will take you there it's goes down for Cincinnati Danton steps up gets away and he's in touchdown Andy Dalton that was a fantastic read and great job by Andy Dalton he decided quick he was decisive and when the defense backed up in man coverage he just turned and took it and if you want to win your teammates over as a quarterback this is how you do it right here no indecision he makes a move and he takes his ball into the end zone like he means it he wants to do it he wants to get to that goal line your teammates see that and say man this guy came to play today Andy Dalton just put a move on CJ Mosley who is we just said it it easy he's one of the best inside linebackers in the league he he'll be talking he'd smack in film tomorrow when he when he sees notes Mosley missed the tackle on him yeah Moses going to lose a little sleep about that 12th rushing touchdown of Andy talk this this season and the extra point by Mike Nugent is good what a start for the Bengals an impressive 10 play Drive and they lead it 7 nothing back in Baltimore the Bengals have choked out to a seven nothing lead a 10play Drive on that drive Cincinnati was three for three on third downs plus they got three first downs from penalties so a good start for Cincinnati and again for those of you expecting to see Pittsburgh and st. Louis we will take you there just as soon as that game begins in st. Louis well Cincinnati has never trailed so far this season and now Joe Flacco's team playing from behind it's 7 nothing with 7:20 to go in the first Michael campanero back deep door suited to kick off the mutants and another touch back for Newton's second drive for the Ravens we come back you're watching the NFL on CBS back in Baltimore and the Bengals out to a seven nothing lead with Steve Beuerlein Steve Tasker and Dana Jacobson I'm Andrew catalon our entire NFL on CBS true Baltimore Ravens the only active team never to be Owen three time to avoid that today and again those expectant hits Burks think the horse will take you there just as soon as the game begins on first down Bengals around the Ravens keep it on the ground with Javaris Allen the rookie out of USC is 11th carry of the year a gain of nine Joe Flacco in his eighth year out of Delaware the Super Bowl MVP water run in the playoffs that year 11 touchdowns no interceptions the Ravens alltime leader in touchdown passes and on second and short Baltimore picks up the first down joe flacco told us it was for them to get off to a fast start didn't happen they ended up hunting on their first drive and Cincinnati methodically drove right down the best war into the field and finished off with a touchdown in a drive that was marked by a lot of penalties on both sides of the football Javaris Allen got that first down run he goes to the bench and Justin Forsett back in the game makes a play at Midtown a short hop pass to his tight end max Williams it's incomplete that was really well defended in the secondary mallalieu ga did a great job of dropping back finding the crossing routes stopping the middle route the deep route was covered by the safety Joe Flacco looked at both of them and had to settle for trying to get the ball out to the fly they're just nothing there this since that defense is so experienced in this system they just don't leave anything uncovered on second intended it's worth a bit there's a flag down the pass is caught by prophet Gilmore that the flag is back at the 30yard line a Jayhawk makes the tackle Pittsburgh st. Louis expected to start shortly and as soon as they do those expecting that game will take you there Walt Andersen the referees been busy illegal shift to players moving and not both setting part of the snap offense fiveyard penalty second down you know it is the little things that will come back to haunt you in situations like this Steve you were talking about the fast start and that's what John Harbaugh was obviously hoping for as well we're only in the second drive but you look at second and 15s all day long it's gonna be tough look at the numbers right now welcome all ready for penalties they had 10 last week in the loss to Oakland so it's second and 15 to Steve Schmidt's and you got out of bounds at the 32 yard line that's what they like to do Baltimore they want to get Steve Smith involved early he's got so much emotion they get him in the flow that there often seems to feed off that he is such a unique personality and he's such an intense competitor and they they all understand him better now in the second year they they understand how important it is to get him involved and set the temple for him which also ends up in turn sent the tip of his team he's a guy that had to get involved early right there's a great example first catch it goes for seven yards which leads the Ravens with third down and eight territory relative newcomer and you got to think the Bengals aren't sold on him yet I mean it's not like they're thinking a Crockett kill more like they think of Steve Smith senior or any of the other players are forced set I mean this is a new guy they wanted he's going to have to prove and hurt them before they start to treat him with some priority in their game playing well right now luga this tote we asked them directly what you think about this young ty he said knots for set flat goals and Steve Smith senior that's it no more in a careerhigh 88 yards and two touchdowns to the Courtyard and I think it's smart for the rabies now because it Steve Smith because of course set to start using guys like Gilmore and their campanero start to spread the football around and force the Bengals to think about more guys than just Steve Smith senior and for said they got to get the football all over the field and forced this defense to keep itself spread as thin as possible Lorenzo Taliaferro listed as questionable with a foot bruised he is active today but he has not carried the ball yet this is course set for the first down it's been 4 set Allen and campanero with that 8 yard run Yanis it's a nice tempo for the Baltimore home runs right hand that's icky they'll go with the short huddle and they're trying to get up to the line get as many plays run as possible right here there they're still in a short huddle trying to get up and get as many plays get try and try and get the rhythm that they want to establish set up early here eath play of the drive for the Ravens with 3:30 to go in the first quarter it's Nick singer he is wrestled down at the 35 by mallalieu go ray Malaga in his seventh year out of us shoes and a new threeyear deal and March and Steve Tasker mentioned this in our open but what a job the Bengals have done drafting over the last several years 38 of the 53 players on their roster will draft mix including mallalieu got a secondround pick in 2009 Johnson ran off because he thought that Baltimore is guilty of a false start yeah they shifted we'll see what the false start in the 74 offense fiveyard penalty if the offensive lineman puts his hand on the ground and he picks it up and you see there and you'll see that you know Hurst James Hurst just lifts his hand up it's right here he's going to lift his hand up and that's AC there that was not just a ship or a resettling after inaudible that was a mistake and it cost him her starting for the injured Eugene Monroe still sidelined by a concussion so it's second at 13 and he's up to the 32 yard line Jones makes the tackle already the third catch for Steve Smith senior and what can you say about this guy I mean last week 10 catches 150 yards only the fourth person in the history of the NFL that 36 or older to go over 150 yards in a game continues to amaze the level that he plays that and a few words with Adam Jones afterwards those two guys could have a fun little matchup it Andre Marvin Lewis sitting where well his corner is meaning a typical tactic on Smith israel Scott look out can't go deep and it's broken up that was enough to pass intended for akin now there's a flag down inside there's a little bit of a scuffle right at the line of scrimmage now while this Gil Barry being restrained these two teams they both told us they do not like each other well and Baltimore is absolutely desperate make no mistake about it they cannot give an inch today and hope to win this game in Cincinnati they want to put them away they could absolutely ruin Baltimore season if they can beat them and if they beat him soundly they might break the heart too I mean that is something that is huge in the NFL to give a team a hole they can't dig out of result of the play was an incomplete pass after the foot play there were dead ball fouls by both teams personal foul unnecessary roughness number 72 personal foul unnecessary roughness 96 defense those crowds will offset it's fourth down so it's a seven Lee for the Ravens Dunlap for the Bengals excuse me Andrew I thought Kirkpatrick was gonna pull this pass in but the other end of this so it brings up fourth and five and John Harbaugh sends out his kicker Justin Tucker for a 50yard field goal attempt Tucker is the most accurate kicker in NFL history at 90% and he's 15 of 21 he's coming here from 50 yards or longer so to the wind conditions earlier it breezy today at the eastnortheast 212 miles per hour Tucker from 50 lifting right and it's no good a rare miss for Justin Tucker his first this season that has been off the mark he has been so reliable for the ravens but off the mark 250 and it's still 7 nothing the Ray Lewis statue outside the gates here in Baltimore and the Ravens trail 7 nothing Bernard with the first down carry to the 45 yard line yeah that over five yards on first down is huge your weekend starts with Thursday Night Football and Joe Flacco and the Ravens travel to Pittsburgh could tough it out with Big Ben of the Steelers that's on CBS and NFL Network on second down Bernard into Baltimore Territory good for a Cincinnati first down Bernard and Hill the second most dynamic duo in the league through two weeks only the Redskins with Alfred Mars and Matt Jones have won four more yards than Bernard and Hill it's attitude on those first two players of this Drive just straighten this Ravens defense that prides itself on being tough against the run up the middle Dalton screen diaper a first down still going flag is I'm back at the 46 yard line but a gain of 18 for eyford if it stands the leg over I think it's going to be an offensive lineman downfield ineligible player downfield talk to the pass on a 60watt offense fiveyard penalty work out Marvin Lewis not a fan of that one well here's Tyler Eifert right here he's gonna pull back for the screen pass but the sinner is the one who the downfield was called you see this play takes time Andy Dalton's gonna fake to his left and then throw it to his right and you see right there you can see that boudin was definitely about three or four yards down the field of step probably a step or two too soon for the experience Center 15 seconds to go in the first quarter Cincinnati keeps it on the ground and that should be the final play of the first quarter after the run by Bernhard gained a couple that's the end of the first corner here in Baltimore Ravens Channel Hoyt and Owen three sir they trail start of the second quarter here in Baltimore and Cincinnati as a 7nothing laden Steve Berlin Steve Tasker and Dana Jacobson I'm Andrew catalon our entire NFL on CBS crew and the quarter begins with Cincinnati facing a second and 14 there were eight penalties called in that course and that's the first sack of hills career the first sack of the season for Andy Dalton and it's tough you running a playaction pass on second and 15 that's not going to pool many defensive players the blitz was timed perfectly by will Hill and Andy Dalton it helped not have much of a chance there while the trill son's out of the game off the line up for the they're going to have to bring at least the pingas have expected him to bring more to get the same amount of pressure they have insects such as of course and the pit and the Ravens are going to need more people or somebody to rise up to equal in production turns down 22 up Shaq coming in the pass is incomplete off Shaw came three on Andy Dalton and the Bengals quarterback had to get rid of it it's fourth down well this is right here he's just going to come inside and get to the quarterback and it's not really that toughest stunt it's an easy stunt that the offensive line of Cincinnati absolutely just blows and here you can see their bowling kid bowling the guard he says hey wait a minute I got grabbed and pulled and that's exactly what happened great stunt by Baltimore they got away with one post once a day for Kevin campanero awaiting it and calls for a fair catch driving them back to the 7 yard line ball tomorrow we backed up to start this next drive they trail seven dumping 1407 to go first half and the Ravens trail 7 nothing cut their passion for flying in the 120 killed finally wrestled down by Dublin drogyn Gilmore with that fifth game last week careerhigh five catches for 88 yards and two touchdowns picking up right where he left off a nice little grab a good adjustment to the ball that ball thrown behind him from Joe Flacco but Crockett Gilmer as he gets that big paw on it from behind keeps the stride going and a nice gain on first down for the rib it goes for 16 yards and a first and ten it's four set and he is met at the line and not much doing that time for Justin Forsett he talked about Thompson with the tackle yeah you talk about Crockett Gilmore and how he's kind of emerged this season he did a lot of work in the offseason as you see those numbers that's an excellent season a start to the season for a guy who's on a Nolan 2 football team he put on 25 pounds from last year with from 250 to 275 as a tied in and that's an enormous physical matchup they did it by cutting out bad foods like pizzas eat a lot healthier this day that passes incomplete interestingly on Gilmore he spent his offseason going to an offensive lineman camp with Charles Bentley's camp in Arizona he got turned onto it by his former teammate at Colorado State Weston Richburg you know often see a tight end good on offensive line company it taught him a lot he used to open his hips a little bit more a little more fluid in the way he blocks and he really got a lot out of that offseason in Arizona and he's a great blocking tight end but I guarantee he came out of there learning a little bit about what it takes to be a great blocker up front third down and 10 for Baltimore Bronco has all day looking g.push mythtanic is down Smith comes up it's incomplete it was for Patrick on the coverage and let's see what the flag is back to the past the illegal contact number 27 defense fiveyard penalty undefeated it does go against Kirkpatrick and in his fourth year out of Alabama he said he used to watch Steve Smith play when he was in middle school Smith now 36 years old automatic first down for the Ravens with 12:45 to go another playaction pass his first of the season now there is a flag down at the 21 yard line and this is gonna be a whole joe flacco heard the official he's walking off dejected the rolling on the field is an interception by Cincinnati holding number 53 offense that penalty has declined first out penalty on Jeremy zou top that's the fourth interception of the season by Flaco in this just a third game very careless interception and throw by Joe Flacco one thing you look at the scatter report I guarantee you on Adam Jones you're gonna find that this is a guy that is known to want to jump things and take chances right there fully committed to the underneath throw and Joe Flacco threw it carelessly out there that that is a big time mistake by Joe Flacco 12 two interceptions of Adam Jones's career this Wednesday so great field position for the Bengals first and 10 with 1237 to go in the first half thoughts in changing the play with five on the play clock single day is coming Dalton got Linda Dan along this side line that passes incomplete Marvin Jones attempted to get his feet down Zoomer Hill was coming quickly for the Ravens sentiment as you look at the pressure on Dalton this is a Cincinnati team as we said is hitting on all cylinders they're also getting some breaks and things are working for them they've got a league high five drives have started inside their opponents territory this would be their Danton touch pass down the shag on three flags come in and think that kind of sums up the first half with three flags on the field dalton threw that ball before it even reached its apex he started asking for the penalty he had his arms in the air but you're gonna see Rashad Melvin was definitely guilty he was tugging on tugging on the tourist interference number 38 you're gonna see right there it's Marvin Jones and you can see the contact right there he's pulling him back tugging him not want to allow any separation it's it's gonna get called every time this day and age second penalty against rashon Melvin and now already ten penalties in this game this is a team here in Baltimore who has said and really you know lived by the adage defense wins championships but I don't know if you can play defense the way you used to play defense in the NFL I don't know that that adage is gonna hold true for very much longer in this league it's hard to play defense in the back end when you touch those guys at all dolphins past effects in an incomplete well Steve to your point though I mean teams have to make adjustments see if they're gonna call it differently name did in the past everyone has to play by the same rules they got to adjust I asked John Harbaugh about it he goes it because we really don't care about that if they just call it the same every week it makes it much easier on the players I found that to be true consistency is the one thing the teams are having a hard time to adjust you're actually inconsistency toohoo decree week to week captain over touchdown Bengals second straight week with a touchdown for Jones and there's an inch of Raven at the goal line well that was a good throw that's Kendrick Lewis who's down but Cincinnati has taken a 13 nothing lead on Andy Dalton's sixth touchdown of the season Lewis is gonna come in from the safety spot right there and you see how you can't he tried to put his shoulder in in his head caught the body of Jones and got hit to the side pretty violently so the interception by Adam Jones leads to six points for now with Mike Nugent coming out to attempt the extra point but of course the concern is with the sixth year man kendrick lewis out of mississippi first year with the ravens late last year with Houston it's an area in that defensive secondary well Baltimore has struggled in the first two games also a little thin Trey Walker the rookie is inactive today will Davis who they acquired in a trade with Miami on Monday also inactive today and goods on there with Lewis on his feet another surprise in Baltimore today is Jason babban he's inactive and John Harbaugh told us on Thursday that he thought babban had figured out this system felt comfortable with Babb and getting out there who was signed after the week 1 loss to Denver yet bapin is still not in uniform to dip babban being signed after the terrell suggs tore his Achilles as a replacement player who had some experience and they felt could pick up the system pretty quickly kendrick Lewis making his way off the field now I don't think there's any question is this this has got to be a point where you got to go through the protocol although he's walking right past the bench right down to the locker room so here's Nugent for the extra point and with 1218 to go in the first half Cincinnati has taken a 14nothing lead Joe Flacco with his fourth interception of the season and it leads to seven for Cincinnati the Ravens celebrated Hispanic Heritage Month by hosting their annual play 60 youth football clinic for 115 Hispanic children the event was held this past Monday at coppermine Fieldhouse in downtown Baltimore you could visit nfl.com slash Hispanic heritage for stories about Hispanic pride and culture from around the NFL Andy Dalton now has six touchdown passes and still no interceptions also ran in a touchdown in the first quarter a three play drive following the interception by Adam Jones it all adds up to a 14nothing lead for Cincinnati try to go to throwing it Oh for the second straight year Steve Beuerlein Steve Tasker and Dana Jacobson on Andrew catalon name thank you for joining us for week story of the NFL on CBS Michael campanero back deep for Baltimore and Mike Nugent now it is 11 and that is another touch back for Nugent big drive coming up for the Ravens when we come back week three of the NFL on CBS back in Baltimore field position has been a big theme early the average starting position for Cincinnati 48 yard line Baltimore their own 16 they start this one at the 20 Justin Forsett on the carry as we check in with Dana Jacobson all right guys we saw on the Bengals touchdown drive their safety Kendrick Lewis injured for Baltimore he walked right into the locker room as part of concussion protocol for all the NFL teams out here as soon as we have an update we'll bring it to you Thank You Dana and right behind Dana's shoulder you saw Lorenzo Taliaferro listed as questionable today with a foot bruise he is active but has yet to have the carry he remains on the sideline here for second down and eight Flacco's pass caught by Kilmore at the 25yard line tackled immediately made by mallalieu gah and that's big football to mark Taliaferro he had a big game last week with the touchdown run he's a nice little compliment too for said right now the extra carries have been going to Jabbar's Allen who's on the sidelines right next to Taliaferro right now for this third and three well every position in the league you're gonna need help I mean sometimes the backup quarterback has to come in and become a starter but certainly on the defensive line and their running backs and some of these positions you need a rotation and those running back to one of those third in three and that pass is incomplete it was thrown behind Steve Smith a three and out and a few blue birds come out here in Baltimore and rightfully so I have to admit here Andrew you know you look at what this Ravens team has done so far two drives three drives were Cincinnati two touchdowns right that that ball was thrown high out of reach of Steve Smith and the bottom line at the performance at this point has been unacceptable for a team so much to play for like the Ravens do today they're one for four on third down to remember he the first two games just to pop Messiah you will be funded the ball and he lost the ball that's a gutsy call by John Harbaugh remember former special teams coach in Philadelphia desperate times call for desperate measures that's the perfect time to call it they were not expecting it although the Bengals rallied and let's talk about that for a minute no question Baltimore Ravens are not looking as good as they are than we have seen them look in the past they struggled through the first two weeks but they weren't out of those football games at all but I'll tell you this this cincinnati bengals team is the best team they have faced yet this season the bengals are good there's no no shame in losing to the bengals but I'll tell you what they need this game the Baltimore Ravens are absolutely desperate and that play right there reflects empathize it so they've said that Baltimore did not lose the football so now we're gonna come down to a measurement as you see it again 15 on the fake remember last week in Oakland Harbaugh went for it on fourth down from his own 30 yard line but he didn't call a fake he kept the offense on the field Marvin Lewis needs to challenge it I do not think he got that he's got to get to the 30yard line that was a play that the drive started on the 20 and they'd lost the ball there and when he falls back on all I see that gained possession but you can't advance a fumble on fourth down although it's is where you was allowed to recover the ball because the ball did not go out of bounds it's dead at the spot of his recovery because he was a player that fumbled it first a scramble that's exactly like my plus it's not late in the game either inside the two minutes so Levine got very lucky with that fumbling the football he's got to recover his own fumble and it's where he regains possession of the fumble is where the ball is Mar so he's fault he's taken down short loses control the ball then pulls it back in beyond the first down marker so it's the second straight week and that backed up in their own end in the second quarter John Harbaugh has rolled the dice on fourth down pays off for hardball and it's first and ten for the Ravens well you can't take that was a fantastic play by Cedric Pearman to make that tackle get to the point of stopping that play up the middle to the 35 yard line the Ravens have got to take advantage of that of that play I mean they've now they've gone to the bucket a couple of times they've had a couple of trick formations they've had a lot of penalties against them now they've grown the fake punt as well they've thrown the interception I mean they've got to be sparked by a reprieve on fourth down by their punt team getting in the football back it's savaris Allen on the carry and Cincinnati or on defense that full dome at Apeco the first one to get their external four in this the front of the Cincinnati Bengals both sides of balls playing so physical right there you see damata picault with the stop but it was across the line very very physical very strong holding that line and not giving anywhere to go there's Lorenzo Taliaferro into the game next to Plateau speak throw down for that to Steve Smith cash machine depending on the squad that's right at the team let's see if they give him a good spot yeah he's not gonna change he got the first down watches he pulled this off as he gets out turns up the field watch his right foot there just get across the line and get the first down well I'm here to tell you that Joe Flacco has thrown a few passes this year he to two interceptions against Denver and the interception today and that throw right there to me they stand out because he's kind of floating that ball out there in a dangerous fashion that ball very easily could have gone the other way as well were used to seeing Joe Flacco rip that football all over the field he's kind of been throwing off his back foot a little bit more than Jessica's an entire career and for the first time ever it's a Delaware Delaware connection black on a dollar and foil the rookie fifth round pick at a Delaware and this play works because as you just alluded to he gets that ball out of there very fast and boiled makes it does a great job hurtling the defender to get the extra yardage but the ball has got to come out quick against Cincinnati horshack trying to keep those legs moving tripped up his 49 yard line it'll be third down a Jayhawk on the tackle or the hurdle there from Nick boy Delaware's alltime leader four receptions among touchdowns and you can see how very difficult it is to make yards against the Cincinnati Deacons Baltimore stick into their game plan trying to run right at them they're not having a whole lot of success but they're they've given themselves an opportunity third and short here Taliaferro in the backfield the gain on third and two now the pharaoh with his first carry and he is stopped close carry of the game Taliaferro is thrown back and that brings up fourth down Petco and bone lab leading the now comes the punter for Baltimore Sam Cooke let go again you'll see it I mean he's right there and you can see just they just can't move those guys out of there it's like the Bengals have got three tree stumps and you that offensive line of the Ravens cannot push those guys out of the middle multiples tryin to run inside the tackles and they just cannot get it done and if it's tablets control Cincinnati has established control that line of scrimmage both sides of the ball this time they punts and there's a flag down there was some contact with the punter cook Smith is taken down on now let's see exactly 43 so either way it's gonna be a first down no no this is gonna be on Baltimore old back here they'll take it at the end of the punt the fans thought it and as did I thought it was running into the punter prior to the kick holding number 44 the kicking team Cincinnati has elected to enforce the 10yard penalty from the end of the run first down timeout so Cincinnati football when we come back 735 to go in the second quarter Bengals have the ball back they lead it 14 nothing Andy Dalton will start this first time 10 out of the shotgun quick pass to AJ Green caught at the 25 chili Smith right there to make the tackle already 11 penalties in this game the most in the first half in any game this season we have seen a lot of Walt Anderson here today gain of seven on first down Ravin circlets Titan gets when a petition news makes the moves on for a first down but there's guess what another flag down at the 32 yard line they call it a jet green for holy idols hope out that house for me last last week and we've been talking about this and with the penalties I guess it's a good time to bring it up after the reception and during the run holy number 18 offense now see that now there's a correction pass interference never a team offense 10yard penalty from the previous spot still second down but for more on the penalty situation a guy that's throwing a flag once or two in his career Mike Carey our officiating expert back in New York Mike we've seen a lot of flags today yes you know last week we saw a lot of flags too as a matter of fact almost twice the average of the year prior so you know what's happened is a lot of competitiveness everybody's trying to challenge the ball challenged everything to see what they can get away with and it's good point but last weekend he said last weekend was the most penalized weekend in NFL history by a wide margin there were two hundred and 60 someodd penalties last week in the NFL over 600 more yeah that uh but before that historic weekend last weekend for the wrong reasons AJ Green makes the catch at the 21 yard line it'll be third down for Cincinnati 615 to go a second quarter now league wide there were over 50 more penalties called than ever before on a week well it was 600 yards than ever before that's more than just players getting more competitive yeah that's referees having some of these well I think there's it's a hard to appreciate some of the wheels that the way they've got on now so we'll see if they can get get it together and start getting more consistent but that's one of the issues bangles are three four four today it's third and nine five on the play clock Dalton fires to a tree green on the sidelines and he makes that catch sets a clutch catch by AJ Green a gain of 17 double covered as well they've got a cushion because look at that they got a trail guy and a top guy that got him over and under and Dalton still fits it in that is unbelievable Brooks and Smith were both on the coverage and they couldn't get it done you can't win if your double team and a guy and they still pick up a third down on him they came with pressure at the right defense called and since it is still gun totting ticket sold she puts it a check it's a new who put his head down Mohamed Sanu not afraid of the contact there they saw Brooks on that last cover it's 31 for the Ravens he's replaced the injured Kendrick Lewis who we saw go out earlier has not returned yet for the Ravens his job on that play is to run underneath that route but just perfect execution by the Bengals Dalton he's got separation he's got to catch at the 25yard line Jimmy Smith the corner is looking for pass interference against green and he doesn't get the call at 10 a sunny one Jimmy Smith had the coverage and green they were both looking back to the ball they're gonna go to the sideline watch as they both turn to look at it AJ Smith a little bit of a push now that's not a that's a good note call you're not gonna get that call as a defender more as an offensive player that's a good that's the first good nocall we've had all day Jimmy Smith took his eyes off AJ Green has lost him fourth catch today for a Jack green with inside four minutes to go in the second quarter point back to AJ Green working on Jimmy Smith again Jimmy Smith is the best cornerback rewarded with the big contract this offseason after the tough foot injury and last year but they are not shying away from him at all today and they continue to use some tempo no huddle here for the Bengals 1st and 10 now this this changing the play right here this is something Andy Dalton has grown into and he's doing a great job at it that's it looking for the enzyme Kirsten new and it's incomplete she chant Mosley came with the pressure knocking Dalton to the ground yes Steve Beuerlein you knew that you played quarterback how longs it take a guy to start to grow comfortable with changing protections calling the play changing the changing the route go into the guy he wants that that's a big step for a quarterback well number one it helps to have time to throw right there they got some good pressure on thumb but you're right those three hundred percent I believe that takes three to five years before a quarterback really reaches his peak as far as knowing what's going on you can see it right here with Dalton and he's running abounds at the six yard line will be third down and short for Cincinnati 308 to go yeah with this red zone now and on a third down and six oh the goodness not a goal to go situation so they actually cleared get a first down but the Bengals are in the driver's seat in this game make no mistake they can do anything they want the whole play but they don't have to throw the football they can run it they can pick their spot what I would do pick the matchup and throw at it situation timeout has been called by Cincinnati with 246 to go that's a good time out first time out of the half for the Bengals that's a really really good time out you can't waste this opportunity to get the perfect play doesn't mean you're gonna score but give yourself the best opportunity because if you go up with 21 points at this point of the game with 246 left it could spell curtains early here for the Ravens and with the 14 point lead you can afford to be a little conservative if you're the Cincinnati Bengals right now try and catch him off guard maybe with a shovel pass or you can see Marvin green running down there tomorrow Lewis excuse me Marvin Lewis running down there to get that timeout right but he's walking it off night he ran down there now he's got to catch his breath but a shovel pass or a draw play maybe a middle screen here would be somewhat I don't know but I think the number one threat is Tyler Eifert I don't think you put the ball in the air at all 17 points three scales in the first half with two minutes to go do not take a chance although you claim your defense is playing so well you make good confident enough to do it it's third down and five light clock expired a delay of game how does that happen that of a timeout the lay of game offense that's the second time an adult he's been called night stuff on the road no doubt about it but a quarterbacks first responsibility coming out of the huddle is to look at that play clock you've got to be aware of that number one and Aunty Dolph in its pitch here he's being told by the offensive linemen Hey look at the clock man it's running down that's inexcusable out of the timeout that's one 46 to go third and ten that's the first false move they've made all day captain tenneal at the pacman Samir's tipping down thorry that's gonna be half yards short of a first down marvin lewis is running down that sideline to get a chance to see exactly how far they've got to go now they can get a first down but it's going to be fourth and about one and a half 52 yards it'll be interesting to see what Marvin wants to do and he's gonna let this clock run down to the twominute hang it's even less than that Steve it looks like it's barely a yard is there a coach's box where these coaches are supposed to stay by the way I mean now he's now he's strolling along there it's like they're trying to decide where to have coffee he's looking at that he wants to get a really good look at how far this is he'll have some time to mull it over twominute warning in Baltimore Marvin Lewis is gonna go for it you guys agree I do not agree I think you got to take the three go up three scores like it's confidence Jake Fisher is reported as eligible Taunton to throw hash time nobody to throw to now I firt makes the catch but he was in first touchdown six and 18 be overturned you've got to complete the process of making the catch even in the end zone yeah I agree I had to come down in possession you're gonna have to review this they'll do it it's it's inside the two minute plus it's a scoring play so you're gonna get it looked at and I think you're right from what I understand that Eifert has to go all the way to the ground roll over with the football and he never has can he never has control this football he gets tangled up he's got to complete the whole catch though to the ground right he gets tangled up with Trawick that handle way there's no way that's a touchdown by the court now question is with the over the line plane he's got to complete the crisis complete the process bad decision by Marvin Lewis as well Walt Andersen has been under the hood talking to New York that entire commercial break he's just coming out now again the call on the field is a touchdown and let's see what Walt Andersen has decided after reviewing the play the receiver is going toward the ground is still in the process of completing the pass Patek and even though the it is not loose Clark and him hitting the ground the pass is incomplete gets the football back and we go back to New York Mike Carey what are your thoughts on this exactly the thing here's the key point though when the contact by the defender comes wider to that second foot coming down in that contact takes the receiver to the ground he has to make sure he gets all those elements before he hits the ground and maintain control all the way through that's true all the way across the field in line to in line very much like the diss Ryan play from last show that drew all that scrutiny I think that's a hundred percent correct you've got to complete the process of making the catch even in the end zone yeah now that both teams are out there ready to play and Walt Anderson still over there now the officials are just now leaving Marvin Lewis on the sidelines but you know what I do you're right Steve I didn't I thought you should take the points go up three scores right before halftime but let's face it if you don't get in you still got jet Joe Flacco backed up in his own end zone and your defense is playing lightsout and I understand the confidence that Marvin Lewis has in his team and you connect I guess you can say okay you can justify it but I think it's the longest in a big game like this you go up three scores make them score keep on the 3yard I'm not gonna Steve Smith tackled at the 16 yard line by reggie nelson and again baltimore as all three timeouts time is ticking 135 to go coming up on Verizon halftime report JB Tony Bart moomer and coach Cowher have all the latest NFL scores and highlights as well as a preview of Thursday Night Football on CBS and the NFL Network that's all coming up on the Verizon halftime report Baltimore needs a chunk play right here a big one back home in the middle of a paycheck catches made it to 21s let's buy one and wrapped up at the 24 yard line a gain of eight and the five Marvin Lewis you know you can start thinking about timeouts situations here too if you want to maybe think about getting the ball back for your offense inside one minute to go just close this one away yeah I don't Brown in the area but it'll be third down and two you're not gonna take a time out if you're Marvin Lewis if they get nine yards or eight yards on front down and then a second in shorter now it's third maybe you take one after third if it's an incompletion with 51 seconds and if there's you know over 40 seconds you might get the chance to get the ball by 10 it completes you don't need to take a timeout but if it's if they stop them short then then they have to take a timeout right Baltimore's gonna throw the ball here so I'm turning to for a first down but there is a flag down this is gonna be a hole on the offensive line of the Ravens soon flags down there's also one on the 40 yard line in the secondary while this has been one of those has well I mean these guys are there they're getting paid by the flag today their arms are getting sore fouls by both teams holding number 96 defense holding number 89 offense those fouls all set third down what we saw earlier that the defensive line of the Bengals with trying to rush the passer and you'll see as you know Carlos Dunlap will grab an offensive lineman and pull him towards him out of the way while one of his teammates loops up inside they got a sack that way good pressure one time and officials are obviously being told that they were doing at Ned Carter so it's third down into again pressure coming came on a blitz he was untouched in Flacco had to get rid of it its fourth and and the incompletion stops the clock so Cincinnati doesn't have to use it timeout they still have two remaining well Marc Trestman the offensive coordinator I think for Baltimore's really got a Newsome man worked some magic in that in that locker room the second half because Cincinnati's beat them to the punch on everything right now Third Point for sam cooke and that was partially deflected out of Jones comes up to make the catch at the 42 so could feel position here for the Bengals 33 seconds to go and they have two timeouts remaining so here we go Cincinnati two timeouts remaining they lead it 14 nothing and remember they do get the ball to start the second half as well it expects this mani to be very aggressive in this situation they've got good field position all they need to do is get more than 20 yards in there in field goal range Giovanni Bernard next to Dalton and Dalton flex it to Bernard up to the 48 yard line not calling a timeout they want to get a piss down here and spike it mix you don't take the time out legit have to place called my huddle that's what should happen immediately taking a long time 14 seconds to go got to chase cap and shucks this one up and out of bounds only six seconds from an guys what you throw it to the middle of the field like Dalton did there I think you have to use your timeout I think you're right and especially it looked like they did not have a second play called if they could have got up to that line quickly it had the second play call you could justify but it taught a lot of times the problem was it wasn't they didn't the play can be called while they're running back to the field the problem is he had one rat left formation then he had the guys information it wasn't children told yeah they this time I think you got to go deep and see if you can get a quick completion and then call a quick timeout now they call timeout yeah electrospray is they were gonna go in the locker room with one anyway and for not using it after that pass six seconds remain third and two only one timeout remaining to Cincinnati won't matter they'll just run the ball here and that'll do it so Marvin Lewis goes into the locker room with a timeout in his pocket but he also goes in while the 14nothing lead and his team will receive the second half kickoff Andy Dalton one touchdown rushing one touchdown passing that went to Marvin Jones and a few more blue birds here in Baltimore",

  "transcript": "well a couple of old friends getting reacquainted in the snow here is Buffalo as Rex Ryan and Marvin Lewis's teams get ready to slug it out here in western New York today's gaming broadcast in Spanish were available using the SI P button on your television the kick next on CBS frustrating week for those quarterback Tyrod Taylor really a gritty performance last Sunday especially after he sustained that sprain of his left MCL that onepoint win in Tennessee but unable to convince Rex Ryan and a medical staff here that he was ready and so EJ menu will perform his 16th overall pick in the 2013 draft finally gets his next chance to start see Bengals have won the toss elected too far and they will kick so Buffalo football Solomon to start better than 70,000 incredible atmosphere here at Robinson Stadium they want to perform well here at home where they love their last two ballgames he's good and will take Italy and will give Manuel the football at their own 20 home from third string quarterback six weeks ago to the starter here in week six EJ Manuel had a chance to visit with him yesterday the scars are being pulled Solomon just four games into last season made him grow seems more confident and more sure of himself and his his own quarterbacks skin if you will decisionmaking and really trust and anticipate throws right a rip bursty 10 from the 20 LeSean McCoy a lot of real estate in front of them first down and a lot more McCoy showing no ill effects from that hamstring injury Vinnie ray finally brings him down as he cashes him for 33 yards into biggles territory they want to come out and they want to be able to run the balls right off that right side of the offensive line and they really have it hold side of the field walled off there's the missed tackle by Drake for Patrick allows it to get to the third level of the defensive there LeSean McCoy does the rest defense allowed them two hundred yards rusty one week ago our longest one as a bill from a Koi first ten playaction to manual is pass over the middle intended for Charles clay and now the officials say incomplete as clay unable to make that shoestring catch wait thinks he caught it the ball could have been thrown looking better there by EJ Manuel look at this right around the shoestring could see and hit the turf but the ball didn't go we're gonna say you've trapped it fans looking at the replay at the big video board here inside the state buffalo is challenging the rolling on the field Rex Ryan folk Mike it's close enough they'll take a look upstairs as we step aside in the early going awaiting the announcement here is referee Blakeman call was a change Tarzan let's bring in our officiating expert from New York Mike Harry Mike what did you see well I would not have reversed this one let me show you why in order to make a catch the receiver has to show clear control for a period of time before that ball hits the ground the ball does hit the ground and that way he uses the ground and help context the pass so if I'm in the booth I don't make this call all right Mike thanks they do overturn the call so at 19 yard pass play here's a personal 101 LeSean McCoy able to barely cross the Cincinnati 25 brought down by Gino Atkins for pickup of four starters for Buffalo Eric wood the Cincinnati native taken on his hometown team former Louisville standout says that the Bengals were terrible and he was growing up watching them play but obviously different story these days Robert Woods making the start Percy Harvin out today with a hip injury goes back to the offseason so Harvin down Sammy Watkins makes his return momentum after missing the last two second and six draw play as McCoy surges far two inches close to the 20 some pushing after that last tackle look like Robert Woods join with that Cincinnati secondary this Bengals defense was good when it mattered most last week that comefrombehind 247 win Carlos Dunlap five sacks tied for most of the NFL Vinnie Ray what a season he's had through five weeks and Adam Jones roll bowler is a cornerback last season for Marvin Lewis has been one of the integral parts I'll be back into the Cincinnati critical third and three manual from the gun as they snap it outside the 21 Magnus swings it over the middle court for a scanning that's the tight end Charles clay so two catches for play the farmer dolphin and a couple of first downs well we said in our open that toss play he's the goto guy no matter who's that quarterback Tyrod Taylor or EJ Manuel when they get in side the red zone number 85 is gonna be their weapon of choice he's their leading receiver and he's been their most consistent player on the offensive side of the ball but for those leader in receptions and seeding yards and touchdowns or to start to his gills Troy your target to meet a man you didn't have the last time they made it started all coming up it's more exotic it's woods through the first five weeks with all his talent sound and targeted just 18 times entering this game today good start Oh mister that were targeted that Sammy Watkins might get upset because look they're gonna play action pass here he doesn't look to the left side which is where Watkins is lined up to play action and they were high lowing the defense had Charles clay in the back of the end zone Robert woods in the front he just dumps it off to woods for a nice game now on second down no the ability to run the football here I think has really been good for their offensive line they started off running the ball very well seven play of the drive this is second and short McCoy showing no signs of that hamstring injury that he hurt originally back on August the 18th revealed after that Miami game week three that he had a bit of a setback leading up to that game they pulled him from that victory in South Florida and here he is looks good so far there's been over the rest the last two weeks and I think it's going to be imperative for him to play well today against the Cincinnati Bengals defense of this offensive line is really in their ability to one blood when they have to pass protect that they fall behind they didn't struggle snap in the third and short wise decision by Greg Roman as Manuel surges forward and they moved the chains that will be first and goal Greg Roman he's going to ride this offensive line today and he wants to get the early lead continue to run the ball bacon or on it 35 to 40 times and maybe limit the number of throws in EJ Manuel that's the recipe in which they want to play against Paul Gompers defense and since it Adam high 57 49ers out pursuit 22 the last four years McCleary surges into the end zone nose yet and the officials say McCoy each's short all right look like he's better traded the goalline there watch the movement as they not defend this back right here look at that Wow helmet another great what off a quick snap and Reggie Nelson is safety able to sneak into the backfield and that'll force a third goal as they lose yardage where's Ian Ellis at number 20 look at him knife at the feet of LeSean McCoy he was able to skip the gap get penetration into the backfield what just excellent timing the sense of understanding that they wanted to be able to run the ball now this is where you could get strong playaction and the sama point comes out of the game we be fixin his end he's into the endzone touchdown Buffalo I throw it when you can run behind a convoy of blockers and uncle bodies pullback look everyone running over to the right Felton's over there they're pulling the car our pack why should say trunks on trail Henderson he gets out 66 just an easy walk into the end zone free Jay man and how about that start from the exam manual fourth career rushing touchdown as he marches the bills 80 yards in 11 plays in under six minutes and had to be dead carpenter is good there was the catch by charles play that set the table the call that was overturned after the Rex Ryan challenge and then all Buffalo from that point on caelius the NFL on CBS is sponsored by Southwest transparency low fares nothing to hide FedEx solutions that matter and by Toyota let's go places some brave fans braving the elements with temperatures in the upper 30s you see the bills drive 11 plays 80 yards north Chloe a rushing touchdown for EJ seven days it's Adam Jones that inside his out hangs on Jones a couple of nifty returns last week breaks a tackle crosses the 40 and carpenter finally able to push him out of bounds it was Adam Jones who ignited that bangles come back with a punt return 49 yards on the run back to give Andy Dalton a short field when we come back Thursday night your weekend starts here with the Seahawks and the Niners and a

want to score their opening drive something big garden four times in their previous five games Adam Jones of 49 piglet time and set him up with excellent field position quick strike AJ Green fourth in the NFL in receiving yards as it goes over 500 for the season with that catch Andrew Whitworth the headliner of his offensive line a Pro Bowler back in 2012 and what a start for Tyler Eifert quickly becoming on aleni tight end of the NFL as he makes his return from that elbow injury that ended his season last year second before just that side the Buffalo 45 which Johnny Hill crosses the 45 picks up a couple against this very stout Buffalo one defense that links the upper echelon of the NFL sheriff use one set at doubledigit sacks each of the last two years Preston crowd taking on his hometown team and Duke Williams making the start those places injured reserve desert earlier this week third three Alton chuckles pass incomplete Giovanni Bernard had his back turned to him for a down Preston crowd in the coverage and the bangles unable to capitalize on that excellent run on the kick from Adam Jones huge series I think for the Buffalo Bills defense you're right after great field position by the Bengals on the kick return they pitch a three and out this bingos office is used to getting off to a fast start so right now Buffalo beers beers control Kevin Huber the seventh year punter Daenerys flora Singles fair catch just outside the bills 1033 yard on the perfectly placed punt from Huber the NFL on CBS is sponsored by FanDuel the leader in one week fantasy football and by chillies mix and match fajitas with new prime rib and shrimp located on Main Street at nearby Clarence New York the great pumpkin farm festival and full effects here in western New York plenty of fun for the whole family hay rides and pumpkin picking they're picking up a few apple cider gods we should find album and overdrive earlier this morning 7nothing buffalo first intent from just outside their own tent madman EJ Manuel could drop this to pass to the tight end it's clay has been dizzy already foot ball comes loose late but the officials say he was down by contact already three receptions and a good start some what have you seen for Manuel well I've seen him come out he's in rhythm getting the ball down the field the tall's playing again down inside the redzone just getting it out of his hands being more decisive the dread Robin how about that using his ability there on the ball we see Tyrod Taylor to it now EJ Manuel on the 4 yard touchdown run Andy plays our six eighty yards in 11 plays to get the touchdown now EJ man that's really gonna help I also had good ones support LeSean McCoy over eight six carries for 44 yards here he is trying to find the seam to the outside breaks a couple of tackles the koi has looked awfully dynamic in the early going brought down out of bounds by Adam Jones we go to New York and JP 32 yard pass play sets this score up yeah this is Carson Palmer's 14th touchdown pass of the year this one three yards off to Malcolm Floyd they take the early lead over Pittsburgh 7 nothing hey Solomon you said 80 plays it reminded me my first NFL game I said a guy was tackled on a 65 yard line back to Spiro and Solomon that's out as long as we recovered JB that's all you have to do able to read go go go really I feel makes this a funny things sometimes third and fourth manual as tiny'mon dark sit near side of the field intended through Sammy Watkins covered by a Dre Kirkpatrick and complete and the bills will sent out their punt unit Sammy Watkins in the news this week saying he wants to be targeted more of course every great receiver has ever played this league you've heard him talk like that and I think he has to be able to handle it better here on terms of going through the agent goal communicating with the coaches but he has high expectations the team has high expectations for helm as well Rex Ryan who likes his players to be confident my certain a mildly disappointed I'd say we spoke to Rex on Friday said that it wasn't a great reflection of Sammy Watkins ear says he's humbled and expects them to pretend years and comes back from that hamstring injury here's Jones so you go and he's returns both kicks and punts with excellent coverage on that play by the bills Ron Brooks as a penalty flag comes in late this could be a taunts and if it is what a mistake by Brooks after just a tremendous play it's not necessary it's not necessary they lead the league in penalties here in Buffalo and you know you made a great tackle but the antics after the tackle aren't necessary unsportsmanlike foul on the kicking team number 33 for Todd Kelly's 15 yards first down since 1169 penalties called against the pills 55 that have been accepted and this one massive the last time the bills were here at home against the Giants in that doubledigit lost a couple of weeks ago that 17 penalties six of them against those special teams they have two touchdowns Paul back in that game against the Giants as a result the penalty so the Bengals start beats at Bill's territory close down pass intended for the offensive lineman Jake Fisher the rookie out of Oregon interesting play call by Hugh Jackson Oh Monday October the 26 find out why critics are saying that Supergirl is Leeds TVs super hero week waiting for Supergirl premieres Monday October the 26th after a new Big Bang Theory only CBS Lion Hewitt splits that bottom you pictured bangles go three tight ends that pass over the middle complete inside the Buffalo 35 it's Tyler Eifert and it's been his return solomon that has given this bangles team just an incredibly different offensive dimension and take a look at the protection provided by andy dog really good job gets mario williams and there you see them getting the ball to Tyler I just talked about that pass matching radius that's a big target six six 250 over the middle fifteen yard pass play well first day all kinds of moving priests knew those trying to snuff it out and they do the place wasn't cool you see the penalty marker coming behind the line of scrimmage with the clock stopped at 5:21 left of the quarter illegal use of hands hands to the face defense number 55 that's Jerry Hughes costly penalty because they had a significant stop on that play and Gretchen has got to be able to do something about this this football team is just too good to continue to hurt themselves in this manner we saw last week on the opening tipoff they get the fumble down inside the opponent's 5yard line called back because they had a player offside the stream has been devastated by penalties right from the start of the season balton stumbles back in on posting ten nearly hit under the beasts as he throws it out of bounds intended for AJ we'd Samba you wonder what you could do as a head coach we know that Rex Ryan handed out wristbands to his players before the game at Tennessee last week that said yes sir as a reference to what they should say to the officials after a penalty has been called but nothing has seemed to work Hildy's are selfish at yeah I think you've got a hold of player accountable to his teammate and his work the team the football team and making other players play for might be a thumbsup a pillory posted 10 it's a day yet snap to Jimmy Hill trying to get downhill closes in on the 20 couple yards short of the first down and now decision time can huge action as they try to take advantage of what has been excellent field position for this offense so far this is where they go to either AJ Green Jackson knows the total time I expect to catch a lot of balls in 2015 so one of those two players now if you doubled one of those guys they lifted Marvin Jones to be able to make a play for Mohamed Sanu Sanu in the right slot AJ green top of your picture third and four Daulton you cited taught that's Marvin Jones reformer fifth round pick out of Cal who missed all of last season with a broken foot first and tenth since Annette over to the right side of the screen Marvin Jones outside the numbers matched up against the fon Gilmore they want to be able to go oneonone Gilmore against Marvin Jones and try to double both AJ green and time right look down inside the red zone so sanur Jones are going to have to beat oneonone in this area of the field no team has been inside the wet zone more than Cincinnati this season first attempt at seven at that field it's Cherry Hill perch to tackle lunches endzone touchdown monstrous separate by hell the kitchen one through six they've got so many weapons down in this area of the field DK Ian Poli he tries to cover watch Jeremy hill coming out of the back field number 75 he's no match misses the tackle then watch the nifty footwork as he goes up and over Stephon Gilmore for the touchdown this is what the Bengals do they can stress you out with their personnel you have to double so many of these players who do you take away and then you have forced to put a defensive lineman on Jeremy hill who's just too good against EPE in power now so much talk about the fact that Johnny mill just does not look like the same player than was as you're working was a revelation over the second half of last season as an issues song with ball security so what adapted on that 15 career and already is six this season like gucci is good as the bangles take advantage of those buffalo penalties Ron Brooks on the taunting and then Jerry fused the penalty jeremyhill doing the rest for Cincinnati tell now for the wisdom of Solomon here in week six sure let's go back to 1988 the last time too big will start at five and oh they played the LA Raiders on the road Boomer Esiason three touchdowns finals for 45 21 the very next week they were faced the New York Jets the Jets attired in the third quarter but my man inky woods would score two touchdowns late in the game they would seal the win that year the bingos went on to Super Bowl 23 did they go back this year I think is a very talented team playing with a lot of confidence good memories for Solomon in those bands as the start to disband his team has enjoyed his it looks some of those good memories for Bengals fans in Cincinnati 19 yards on the run back by Goodwin as EJ Manuel comes back onto the field Rex Ryan talked about the decision that he'd have to make with the quarterback he anticipated that Tyrod Taylor would be medically cleared but he said even if that was the case he'd be making that last call you see Taylor on the sidelines has to be frustrating Salomon after the game he had last week yeah he is just too good I think the jeopardize he singlehandedly carried that team on his back in the fourth quarter last week on the road against the Tennessee Titans and now he gets away to EJ Manuel both players play very well i preseason manual from the shotgun first the 10 fighters and completes and he has looked almost exclusively in the direction of Charles clay good pickup on first down of seven and why wouldn't you know Charles clay is a guy remember he was with the Miami Dolphins one year ago the Dolphins put that restricted tag on him and the Buffalo Bills went about willing and dilling this offseason to buy him loose from the Miami Dolphins and since he's come over he is not disappointed he's the team in receptions and every season right second and three manual puts an air underneath it when that one falls incomplete intended for woods who had a chance to visit with clay yesterday at the Bill's facility we asked them about what the adjustments been like in South Florida to Buffalo he said it's ploy it's different up here you have to worry about things that I never had to think about before said he hasn't bought a snow blower yet Solomon and we were concerned and for him yeah I had to get one of those quickly he's a talented player you already saw the cats he had on that first Drive setting up their first score today play clock down to three third and three manual buyers middle of the field it's intercepted what a play by that Cincinnati secondary it's dark as Dennard 12 yards on the return Denard the former firstround pick last season has been biding his time biggest play of his NFL career you love the play by the former firstround pick came over one year ago you're gonna see the receiver here he's gonna try to get vertical but look this ball is just a little bit under thrown you'll love the fact that dark Western art stays in position in the hip pocket now watch this came in from that slot position actually and he was able to get the interception doc where's in our play that pass very well here EJ man you've got to get that ball over the top to Chris Hogan dart was denied it was had a chance to learn behind some of these veteran players in that secondary twenty fourth overall pick last season feeling awfully good about himself on that Cincinnati sideline looks like perhaps an inadvertent whistle Rex Ryan having a discussion with the officials on their side of the field with the game clock stopped 226 and this game tied at 7 now Rex is upset about something not sure what it is waiting for confirmation from the replay booth on the previous play ok Clete Blakeman our referee let's go ahead and take a look because maybe they're saying that darknes Denard didn't fully make the cats or did he control it not so sure what's in doubt here cuz that clearly was a nice catch he held on to it ball never even hit the ground or perhaps Salomon checking to see if there was contact from the Buffalo player to see if where they should spot the football it was Chris Hogan and from the first angle salmon didn't appear to be any contact initially the return by dark was Denard was 12 yards as we await confirmation a lot of time to figure this one out and again this is something we've harped on at the lathe with some of these reviews I've not been short okay we know he made the catch now let's see was he touched also on the review to see where the ball should be placed I don't see anything there that shows he was touched right around that 40yard line crosses 250 down to the Buffalo Bills 45 and that's where the ball has been spotted now so maybe Rex Ryan is contending that dark western art had been touched back at the 40yard line but I don't know that I saw anything there that the leaders believe they should bring the ball back the first career interception for Denard that much we do know we asked Marvin Lewis about Denard said that this kid came out of Michigan State ssam and more stable and more mature than most players at that juncture as a cleat Blakeman comes back from underneath the hood first down Cincinnati alright let's bring in our officiating expert again Mike Carey Mike take us through that play well here's what they're looking for since you had clear control all the way from the top to the ground now we're looking to see if was there a contact by the defense but there's no angle to see precisely to reverse or confirm that's why the all right Mike carry our officiating expert weighing in from New York so again another short field for Andy Dalton and the Cincinnati offense endaround Mohamed Sanu appears to take a look down the field and then lowers his shoulder taking on a wouldbe tackler so Hugh Jackson saman going deep into the playbook they pick up eight they want to get the ball down the field right here the AJ green but take a look he's covered Mohamed Sanu wants to throw it see right there he wanted to throw it but he read the defense perfectly instead of forcing that ball down the field and risking being intercepted Sonu made a good decision not to call them all some knew the fourth year man and if what is you thought my third winning pick we've seen you throw the football before with good success second in short Charlie Hill must be featured running back till this point catching one on the touchdown earlier tackled by Manny lawsy right now I think if you're the Cincinnati Bengals you have to be basic we know they want to get the ball in the hands of AJ Green or Tyler Eifert but the Buffalo Bills have determined not to allow number 18 or 85 to beat them that means they're gonna have to make good decisions of going elsewhere with the football be very patient and maybe allowing AJ Green and Tyler Eifert to make their plays a little bit later when Rex Ryan shows oneonone cup Hugh Jackson wants to think about it as Cincinnati will burn its first time out Hugh Jackson who actually interviewed for the Bills head coaching vacancy before Buffalo elected to hire Rex Ryan another little wrinkle to this heavyweight battle in the AFC it is a heavyweight battle this is an important game for both teams as you take a look at Hugh Jackson looking at that late call sheet I think the Bengals have to validate that big win again Seattle three to six and oh and then your Buffalo remember here in western New York it started with a lot of excitement here but now you across each of your last two games here at home you need to come away with a win bird in short it still able to get his shoulders going downhill picks up a couple and a Cincinnati Bengals first down and also Solomon something to prove for this Bills defense we mentioned that last big test that they failed here that week to game against New England gave up a boatload of points before Tyrod Taylor who's able to make it respectable where it's wide expects big things from this unit on this kind of stage it's like falling to this point by Hugh Jackson in Cincinnati first and ten from the 35 Dalton quit truck over the half and complete unable to locate Marvin Jones excellent coverage by Stephon Gilmore playing the best football of his career there is no doubt Gilmore has made plays like this all season long from week one against the Indianapolis Colts last week made tremendous amount of plays on the back end of the defense and you could see one on one against Marvin Jones he's got to be able to win if they're going to double cover Iceland and AJ Green Gilmore that decisive interception together in Tennessee last Sunday night's Marvin Jones buried right after the cat's Marcel Darius and a host of other bills and on the tackle they lose a yard wide receiver screen that Jones has got to be more decisive and get that ball up the field he's got to cut it up but it was well defended by the Buffalo Bills defense you get the sense this is a real struggle for the Cincinnati Bengals office to get going against real talented defense crowd is into it so it's gonna take a lot of energy a lot of patience but the pingos offense to make money against the bills today Bengals third and 11 one went away from matching the best start in club history that they need a big play here to move to James five defensive backs and they're going to try to double on the tie here Sidhu a Martha tome got to be able to land in this situation panting snap Dalton can only fall in a football as Cincinnati averts disaster Russell Bodine the center this one was snapped they lose 13 yards on the play look eat it actually it was a good snap dog took his eye off of it he should have been able to have it he was waiting he had his hands up ready for the snap from the center Russell bow dine looks like that this is given Michigan State game last night I keep guy on the ball Michigan fans still in fetal position I'm sure Wolverine's last night Huber had a good punch on his first offering the various wrong signals their tents inside his own 15yard line a 36yard punt from Huber a week six continues later today on CBS n with some of you on Boxton tonight Sunday Night Football on NBC tomorrow at Monday Night Football the NFC East battle between the Giants fools we are in western New York Ralph Wilson Stadium better than 70thousand this place has been pulsating right from the start Spiro be disarmed will cats rest of our CBS crew as you see the first three possessions for the bills already some highs and lows reject manual yeah he's got to be able to stay evenkeeled as he does about the ballgame shotgun defense the draw play is not very nice efforts you that some positive yardage and we visited with EJ Manuel he's waited so long for this moment the scars of being pulled Solomon over to his four games last season we asked him where he's improved and the first thing they talked about was big his emotions new chef talked about that Houston game took the disappointment with him to the facility Doug Malone sensed it and eventually pulled the plug says he's drawn from that point he also said the players are out from those negative moments Havasu agrees and know that his body does affect the rest of the team and your pump fakes and women have delayed handoff this is McCoy at the long 33 yard line earlier and that'll set up a third down nifty one by McCoy a pickup of seven or if you're the Bengals you've got to understand you've got a seal off the edges LeSean McCoy he wants to do this bounce it as he did getting around Geno Atkins there then Carlos Dunlap these are guys that will run between the tackles but he would more prefer to be able to bounce him get to the edges where he could make for a long run Seward buffalo has done much better today than they've been so far this season third and three time Patrick starts to collapse able to get the football out Wallace Gilberry as you see Cincinnati asking for the penalty and now the flag will come in late from cleat Blakeman let's go ahead and roll if we're going to show you the coverage here as the pressure pours in on EJ man look we stopped it all right there take a look every guy is covered he's got nowhere to go with the football and the pressure continues to pour in now he does get out of the tack out of the tackle box there tries to throw it away but it's too late there was no receiver near where he was and he didn't get the ball back to the line of scrimmage this is why they're going to penalize him for intentional grounding 18 yards on the play when you factor in the penalty and saw a tough situation here for Buffalo as they will have to punt from zone with Colton ship families have stockpile because it's further than 10 yards back from the previous spot it's also lost it down brings up fourth down clink Blakely makes the announcement so here is who has been very busy 14 piece over the last two days this is we're out of gel would like to be a to goodness day your position swing has to get it off quickly Jones backpedaling but makes the catch out of bounds but once again excellent field position for Andy Dalton after a 53yard punt on Tuesday the bills joint with the United Way of Buffalo and Erie County to host a flag football clinic in conjunction with fuel up to play 60 100 students from Buffalo Public Schools participated in warmups and drills led by players as part of be fuel up to play 60 program who is also an autograph session where the players would have thrilled for those youngsters earlier this week better than 70,000 all tied at 7 Cincinnati and Buffalo bangles trying to get to 6 and oh and the bills looking for what would be an enormous home Windham here in week six look at the average field position for this offense on the season that's tired years in terms of their field position battle gels is so good in the return game we use at all plural of yerba there is Giovanni Bernard this lethal onetwo punch that Hugh Jackson has had at his disposal Bernard healthy again enters the gate third in the NFL with five and a half yards per rush she is so good at just again another one of those weapons along with Jeremy Hill we talked about the receivers the dual threat at running back between Hill and Giovanni Bernard Hugh Jackson and Andy dog they know how to use the weapons on this offense Jake Fisher back on the field back up offensive tackle is eligible of already protected one pass in his direction second for Dalton little squeeze of the guard out of the back here medical crisis apartment losses the thumb Williams as Bernard picks up 24 on the catch and run if they're gonna double cover everyone down feel and try to match up Preston Brown the linebacker he's matched up against minorities that's too fast able to get around and outside of Preston brown who's walking who is good and tough until the dog takes left Duke woods when he has been healthy for lard among the best allaround running backs in the NFL first eat ten years Dalton surveys the defense rosette is nice IEDs caught that's Ryan Hewitt and they say completed pass Hewitt able to get both feet down as they pick up 13 yards in a first down you know he was just one of these utility players he can feel a little bit of everything got asked did he get two feet inbounds though I didn't look like little half an inch like wanted to be there yeah they're gonna come back and take a look at it but it's a guy that's been a fullback in this off it to tight end it's done some of everything Ronald Darby Buffalo has challenged all the coverage no Rex Ryan has already won one challenge appears as though he'll win a second it looked like Hewitt had that second foot down and it wasn't even close the NFL on CBS is sponsored by Bud Light make the right call drink responsibly acura the leading automotive brand in safety performance and by AT&amp;T DirecTV and AT&amp;T are now one bringing television and Wireless together awaiting the ruling on that last call which was a completed pass to Cincinnati's Ryan Hewitt here's Cleve Lakeman after review play the field has been changed Buffalo is not charging the time out all right Rex Ryan pitching a perfect game let's bring in Mike Carey once again Mike well this is much closer than you think watch his right foot is it down when he catches the ball when it first hits his hands or was it up very tight to call this one I would have let stand there's the right foot right there that Mike is talking about kind of thought that right foot came up Mike in my opinion whereas the ball came in but you know Mike said he would have called it a catch and I think a lot of people in Cincinnati would agree I'm gonna let the place Dan I don't think I ought to call that a catch but that was too tight to reverse in my opinion hi Mike thank you some very close calls in his first half already just a small example of how subjective and how difficult the job is that these officials have trying to make these calls in real time and with that Buffalo gets an extra challenge because they will write a tune till this point quit strike that's Marvin Jones over the middle as Andy Dalton picks up nine through the air Dalton Salman has completed passes seven different receivers already and Sanu has been able to catch one and you talked about Marvin Jones getting other players involved in the offense is gonna be critical in it but make so much attention on the defense to AJ Green Dalton tenderback but a concern and what it's good night shut out of a cannon into the end zone for the Cincinnati touchdown 17 yards as the Bengals take their first lead where you got to love it the Andy Dalton did a really good job of second down into the wrong game watch they pulled the backside guard and tackle 65 flint bowling Andrew Whitworth open up the door for Gio Bernard to Walsh's way into the end zone lost the two big guys getting around the corner pulling it off back up I've been coverage dissent so much on the wide receivers they forgot to play the long Giovanni provides showing off the wheels on that Sprint's huge another point after as the Bengals March 5 plays 55 yards in just over 2 minutes 17yard touchdown run by Giovanni Bernard the bancos 8 punt to the first time in his first half of 7 with tenant change levels before halftime Sparrow Dida Salman will cats as Andy Dalton and Cincinnati trying to remain perfect hooked a buffalo sideline one of the tackle Sean trail Henderson the former seventh round pick out of Miami has suffered a concussion they've taken him into the locker room and will try to get an update on him as quickly as we can how about Sammy Watkins aw man you mentioned the comments that he made wants more targets quiet till this point he's only been targeted once in the game you can see him going at it with Adam Jones this is the one time they did target Hill was not able to haul it in Drinker patches on the coverage and now he's just kind of off to the side remember they moved up from the fourth overall pick one year going to draft to I should take the 9 to summer for to take them but have it games in the whole lot at least hear the 2015 season right first sample coy on a drop play loses his footing and loses yardage on first now now we've been told the Chandra Henderson will return with the concussion and so sorry squad Joe secondary tackle out of Alabama and the former secondround pick this next man up he did law report for them to continue to work and pound the run game up hundreds if a butyl needs that group to be therefore suited the great Robbins once named then they are passed protection and trying to protect the quarterback News Sackboy had clay wide open under throne the pressure was coming from widest Gill Perry and Maddie was off target it'll be third and long Emmanuel has got to set his feet and make this throw it was pressure paring down but see he's got to stay within himself see him gather himself yeah he felt a little pushed a little shoved in the back but this is ball clearly under thrown play with Vidal all the manuals five completions four of them have been to play where is she walking walking 1314 you will over the better hours Chris hold in the water and into 30 Hogan well short Vinny ray on a tackle 8 yards but once again the pillows will punt the bingos defended it perfectly they rushed three days if you eat a manual you don't want to force that ball down the field good coverage you check you down the hole get allow him to possibly break and slip a tackle and try to create a first down but you have to be very conservative in that situation this has been a very impressive Cincinnati defense started slowly last week and that victory over snap to allow 25 points in a game this season on six teams to make that claim Jones an outside line it beats his way across the 45 close to the 50 penalty marker thrown Rex Ryan holding his breath so many penalties against his special teams this season 45 yards on the punt 18 on the return from Jones during the return personal foul grabbing the facemask on the kicking team radiates it's a 15yard penalty from the end of the run first down Cincinnati its Marquis Goodwin on a face mask and that look from Rex woman tells the story another penalty another senseless penalty as why would you grab someone's face mask right there you can see them and that's not going to help you you're not even on the field of play of your mark mark please Goodwin there you got to stay in the field to play be able to make a tackle on Adam Jones right now Rex Ryan saying it's Gila 58 good all these issues by far the postman so our peaceful May 1st through 10 once inside Bill's territory for Andy Dalton and this a pets Jeremy hill or the nice little run on first down tonight on 60 minutes Darrelle Revis one of the NFL's greatest on and off the field plus the generous spirit and people behind Make A Wish tonight only CBS 7.6 anatomy that continues so on we come up on eight continues so on we come up on eight minutes less as good Owen hopelessly looks on from that bill aside look at the average start who sits in Italy to this crap Dalton you side pleats ready to 30 that's Marvin Jones has been busy in this first half Jones his fourth catch at over 20 yards he picks up six how many times have we seen Jay let's get some of these stop or comeback routes they could be sent the corner up for a stopping goal one of the double moves Jones is really good at stretching the defense and getting deep with the vertical route so stuff like that they you want one of those double buoys to get it into the area Dalton I'm 33 because red rose up thrown across his body and just tosses it out of bounds good decision by Dalton not to force it in field goal range as Mike Nugent and his unit come onto the field i watch the double blue by AJ gray right there that's pin up but they were able to grab him on Dalby there then the pressure was on and he thought green felt he should have gotten the ball could see Hugh Jackson st. stay with it because he was ready to beat rod Darby on that double boom we were forecasting barb the long snapper Kevin Huber is the holder majored stallion long 2014 this morning is good from 47 yards out Cincinnati Texan three and pills on its lead now at 10:00 on CBS the NFL on CBS is sponsored by Walmart for winning gametime recipes visit Walmart calm and by United States Air Force experienced more at Air Force calm those 17 unanswered points by Cincinnati after Buffalo drove 80 yards on their opening drive it was all EJ Manuel but so the wild pendulum swings turn an NFL game is right now the bill is desperately looking for some points the Bengals have taken advantage of this great field position they've also taken advantage of some critical penalties at critical moments by the bills helping the Cincinnati Bengals to get points on the board so right now in Cincinnati playing a more complementary style of play with just plain clean good offense good defense to take the lead here in this ball game so much influence on this the Buffalo for obvious reasons but after today they met on the plane fly to London will play Jacksonville overseasoned at Sunday four of their necks bodies on the road as Goodwin is buried later and at ten and it looks like Goodwin is hurry so EJ Manuel trotting back onto the field trying to fight his way through some struggles in his first out yeah and after the first Drive this is it struggles to talk about grill join the interception the dark Wes Denard it did getting out of spotted getting hit with the intentional grounding penalty it did from there just hit find his rhythm to get the ball to his open fight in Charles clay and so the offense isn't really struggle after that first possession you can see the for drive since for three and outs that's not good at all he's got to begin to find something rhythm and just get the ball out of his hands poking it as he told us trust what he's saying and it cut at least his Tyrod Taylor features join us left MCL and sustained it's gonna see last week so he is a spectator here and week six parsley tape from inside the 15 fakes the handoff throws my clay snatches it out of the air and picks up six tackle on the play by the safety George I loco what did he gain Manuel told us spent the offseason working with former NFL quarterback Steve de Berg trying to shorten up his release said he had a tendency because a baseball player come around and look at too much when it is more time this is what they need to do more run the ball it's with Sean McCoy's inches closer to the first down he said the other thing that Steve de Burgh helped him work on some is being more decisive with the football making those snap decisions that you have to make this a quarterback they talked about creating a board natural throwing motion but that isn't sync with just the instinct to be able to trust what you see and be able to read the defense but have a good feel for it and trust what you see and so that everything sort of works together the head and body this is something I thought that came natural the first new games we saw a Tyrod Taylor play it is a kid that I think he's earning his way into the hearts of everyone here in Buffalo now EJ Manuel the former firstround pick was said today that providing his performance today maybe he could play his way back chaydez crew confirms a first down for Buffalo about that especially if your Tyrod Taylor you see some of the reports you lead your team to a win fight your way through a knee injury to do it during that game I could potentially lose your job if your backup comes in and performs well the cool reality's samba de bonne ann\u00e9e Jay Manuel if every years a former firstround picks a lot invested in their head coach Ryan traded again Tyrod Taylor my street ended his train pass McCoy able to cover up the football Michael Johnson coming in with that karatechop at the end of the play and I stand corrected they actually sigh Tyrod Taylor does off see right in free agency but nonetheless both guys are young they're talented Tyrod Taylor's had four years to kind of sit back and watch and now getting his opportunity Wow DJ Mag knows kind of had to learn and grow through trial and error words that say he wanted to trade for Tyrod Taylor when he's head coach of the Jets a trade that never came to fruition Manuel on second and seventh season far side Sammy Watkins with his first kiss first down cats they pick up eight and moved the chains and hear the cheer from 70,000 plus separation against Drake her Patrick and what a throw from EJ Manuel he was able to cut it loose trust what he saw and I agree with Xander Watkins not a jump start this offense though they could run the football with the Buffalo Bills but yet got it started Sammy Watkins and allow his talent to really work to this off going making his second appearance as a miscommunication there between he and EJ Manuel Manuel nice job to make something out enough didn't appear that Aaron was on the same page with Manuel second and nine Aaron it was signed what one week ago so it's all new to him lined up to the right you can see he's not ready to take it sort of a read option inside zone run play Aaron's got to be more in tune with his play game down in signed on 26 stays on the field on 17 no this is herring pass the 40 close to the 45 they pick up eight it'll set up a third in short rain Eluga and Vinnie Ray combined on a tackle and now when you see the big bodies come on for buffalo roam felt at number 42 it's a clear sign they're gonna come with the power run game you get third one Greg Roman the offensive coordinator you don't have to ask a lot for him to dial up a run play certain wood going into the locker room right marquise good on a train on him as quickly and third and short Manuel fakes the sneak that are screen to McCoy trying to bust it outside lunches to the first down marker penalty marker comes in from the secondary most signal yet from the officials and this one appears to be a hold against the bills that's a sort of a interesting play you bring in the big bodies pack it in if you try to bait the defense and then you flip it and throw it over to LeSean McCoy to get outside holding offense number 10 so 10 yard penalty from the previous slide we played there now Robert Woods on the penalty we know Greg Roman they're coordinators very multiple in his one looks you know that's a play that we haven't seen and again Spiro another penalty descent Greg Roman back in his play calling you can see right here there it is right there number 10 against Drakkar Patrick holding the ball ten movement priests knew that Wallace Gilberry over 95 looked like he was drawn off sides by the heart out nutria zone infraction defense that's Wallace Gilberry were told it is a rib injury for Goodwin his return is questionable as Cincinnati is called for its first penalty big decision here for Greg Walden married to the Bears go on further than six down ten with all three timeouts left let's pick up on the koi that past fired far side of the field woods with the catch first down a pickup of nine Kirkpatrick on the tackle really good throw by EJ Manuel and they're starting to work in front of Dre Kirkpatrick as Woods is able to snap this one off settle in front for Patrick giving up maybe a little bit too much cushion have to be able to drive on that ball the water throw from Manuel to make some plays starting to get in rhythm throwing the football it should take us down to the twominute warning and some extra time for Greg Roman to talk it over with his quarterback EJ Manuel 17 straight points for Cincinnati up 10 you're watching the NFL on CBS oh Cincinnati offense that entered the day averaging four hundred and twenty yards of total offense has been held in check part of that having to do Solomon with the short fields that they had right now the Bengals up by 10 17 unanswered points two minutes to play those have all three timeouts first and ten from outside their own 45 inside Cincinnati territory second catch of the day for Sammy Watkins they picked up nine good battle between he and Adam Jones and they're started to get Sammy Watkins involved he caught this ball in between the live backer and the defensive back actually two defensive backs dock with Bernard providing the underneath coverage but you've got to keep a player like Sammy Watkins the wide receivers come involved early so they could start to get into women in his employ on second esure crosses the forty first down here at ten as McCoy picks up for now timemanagement a huge aspects on this thing for Rex Ryan with all three timeouts in his back pocket yeah yeah I'd like to see him go ahead use him to try to get two points here but right now you got to push the ball down the field if you're EJ man dedicated to scoring position and you'll from the damn force the team toppers that was barely able to get to the line of scrimmage as now Buffalo will take its first timeout a reminder to keep it here the Verizon halftime report is coming up next we'll send you to New York JB Tony Bart boomer and coach Cowher is standing by the latest scores and highlights as well as a preview Thursday Night Football on CBS and NFL Network on the Verizon halftime report spero Dedes Salman Wilcox what's Greg Roman talking about Salman with EJ Manuel I think he's gonna try to get the ball to his numberone playmaker to me I think it's got to be Charles clay over the middle of the field they've had some good looks and he's been holding it at times EJ Manuel has not been able to hit him Bob the Cincinnati Bengals now I've been hearing all week or how they're gonna target Sammy Watkins he's got to be double covered in this area of the field the job to squeeze it in there got an intercept Manuel trying to get it over the wire Sampson who is able to get back that he stands before the suits right on cue catches it gets to the 30 tackled by Vinny way that'll set up a third and short first down no signal yet from the officials and out we play Clinton says first down Buffalo that was smart to go hurry up try to get a new set of downs head use the timeout 33 seconds left but a timeout still in your pocket like to think they're gonna take a shot at the end zone you're at Cincinnati peoples though to me you've got to be this is where your past rush has to be able to come to life for you what did Marvin Lewis tell us yesterday that he loved about his D fantasies my defense is now getting critical stops at critical moments in ball games you saw him do it last week against a mobile quarterback like Russell Wilson in that fourth quarter they got significant stop one possession after another Paul Gunther's group has done a good job and now they need a stop here it's where he has seen some of the biggest growth within those teams you don't last first team in the NFL since 2011 to win after trailing by 17 or more in the fourth quarter manual on first at 10 complete suicide that's Charles Brown taking on tack lose close to the 20 mainly play by klay the former dolphin 7 hardfought yards and it looks like Adam Jones is the injured Bengal he ran into Charles clay pretty hard play didn't move backwards at all he's big guy take a look at this but if you're the bigness you gotta know Charles play is the goat bigger guy Wang and with that collision of looked like clays helmet what John's right new sternum John's a guy saw him and he throws his body around sacrifices himself what a player he's become with the roller coaster that he's been on in his career banged up that elbow injury a couple of weeks after their week three game I was able to create his way onto the field didn't miss any time and a good sign as Jones is able to walk off for run off on his own power Marvin Lewis even talked about Adam Jones being you know one of the players that's so much improved in terms of the leader that he's become on this football team an impact player we've already shown you on special teams how he helped with field position but the toughness that he provides he'd be working with some of those young defensive backs on the back end we've got one of the leaders one of the guys they rely upon Jones still admits he has issues with his composure on shutting his season but the evolution nice game has been incredible the Buffalo seconded 323 seconds left manual flash death that a Florida one and so is what gives for the touchdown snotty 2yard into the strength from manual this is incredible question there the bunch formation and he's lined up with Charles play and look he's got him come down the field right here and as EJ Manuel gets out they drop coverage on Sammy Watkins they had it covered initially but watches Manuel uncovers and then he's in wide open on the back end how do you leave Sammy Watkins wide open in the end zone looks like most of the coverage was called over to play George I woke up they there and no one couple Sammy whines and Sammy Watkins is on the field got up very gingerly started to walk to the sideline and then went down to the turf Watkins has been just unlucky when it comes to injuries multiple ailments last year missed a bunch of training camp this season with a glute injury then at the calf in week 3 in Miami missed the last two games and even on a play where he scores a touchdown Salomon and clutches what appeared to be his left ankle as the trainer's come on in the field the unfortunate the exam that footed the ground trying to stop himself to come back and catch the ball that was it well thrall but good enough for him to get under it be able to make this catch you can only hope that he's okay because this guy is healthy now he was a talented player take a look wide open milk jam that put in the ground trying to stop himself that's right cut back like its he was able to hold off it amid the baths what an effort by watching injured able to maintain his concentration and catch a 22 yard touchdown pass from manual what about Ajay Banga 15 plays 86 yards they needed him to make the play remember they had gone three and out their previous four possessions and scored on the first possession but did you go three and out for three times now your defense starts to wear thin for him to be able to go the length of the field on this final possession here in the first half when they helped his football team going in at the half it really gives his defense the rest they need keep in mind Buffalo is already without Percy Harvin they're number two receiver today hip injury Robert Woods making his second start of the season so they certainly hope that Watkins is going to be able to come back in the second half as Dan carpenter lines up for the point after by the way for Manuel's first touchdown pass since a week before season and what was his last start before today bark under is good and Buffalo able to cut the Cincinnati lead to three another reminder coming up next the Verizon halftime report from New York Bowser gets you updated on the NFL here in week six plus a preview of Thursday Night Football on CBS and NFL Network the Verizon halftime report comes your way next on CBS salman we expected it to be physical we expected it to be close threepoint game closing seconds the first down there we go both quarterback surrounded with weapons but how about the mobility of BJ Manuel to get the bills their first touchdown and then Jeremy here very nifty getting this one into the end zone in his running mate in that backfield XEOMIN are these campers in for a touch Sammy Walker says he got a target me and I'll get me into the end zone he does bear on a 22 yard touchdown reception at the end of the second quarter so he said an up GAID but culminated 15 blades ajar drive will walk the straight about the bills dressed five receivers today this good fiddling had to leave with a whip injury his return questionable already know Percy Harvin and Al Watkins limping into the bills locker owners will get an update on him at halftime get you caught up as soon as we get ready for the third quarter the Bengals outscored opponents the first half overwhelming fashion Bengals by the way will receive the football to start the second half AFC slugfests here in Buffalo those drove 80 yards on their opening drive took a 7nothing lead and Cincinnati with 17 unanswered before Buffalo scores to cut it to three halftime in Buffalo the mirai's in halftime report is coming up next after this message and a word from your local station you're watching the NFL on CBS halm of Super Bowl 50 oh it has been tight it has been physical everything we expected between Cincinnati and Buffalo as we got ready for the start of the third quarter right now let's take a look at he good love it presented by McDonald's Buffalo with good offense early touchdown one get it into the end zone and Emily as they go right at birth Cincinnati defense bangles scored 17 unanswered at one point before that last bill is touchdown spirit leader Solomon Wilcox anethe on CBS continues three point game some and any adjustments that Rex Ryan could make as they try to come back from three points down well I think Rex Ryan is doing a really good job because they're keeping the lid on this Cincinnati Bengals offense they're doing a good job this because offenses always been very explosive and right now Rex Ryan is keeping them hemmed in I think what they have to do though is continue to keep pressure on and II thought they haven't had the sack yet but Andy Dalton only has 78 yards passing so far in this game if you're the Bengals you got to find a way to free up there wide receiver AJ Green have to be able to produce more explosive plays for this offense I think right now what the bills are trying to do is force Andy Dalton to be patient they have to go the length of the field without having those big explosive plays and then EJ Manuel he's got to continue to be decisive we saw him get much better in the second quarter than he was in the first Psalm and so much expectations for the bills coming into the season they hire Rex Ryan all the free agents spending in the offseason it was tempered after the New England loss as you see Sammy Watkins moments ago on crutches just outside the Buffalo locker room getting xrays awaiting an official announcement on that injury from the Buffalo Club their identity and Jones closest 2:30 but again a penalty marker comes in it's a return of 30 from Adam Jones whose cleat Blakeman our referee during the return illegal block in the back return team number 74 ten yards from the spot first down Cincinnati it's Jake Fisher on the penalty as we take a look at some of the numbers in that first half great field position for the Cincinnati Bengals offense one of the reason why they were able to score 17 points in the first half protecting the football penalties are down and so your handy dog looking at 78 yards passing for him in the first half of this game he's got to begin line it up and get more production out of the constants and pass is caught that's Marvin Jones well it sound right after the catch a pickup of five but just as I was saying earlier Psalm and all the heightened expectations for the bills then they lose the way they did to New England week two of the home loss to the Giants here a couple of weeks ago just so much importance on being like this another contestant about it that means they're gonna have to play big in the second half second five mother cooks tank this is Jones first down in the catching one as he crosses the twine tackled by Preston ground as he picks up nine and they moved the chains again firsthalf possessions for this vaunted Cincinnati office yeah look at that three play seven yards on that very first possession to remember there used to scoring touchdowns on that first possession of most ball games a Hugh Jackson right now I think so to do something to shake loose for this offense they've got if he ever create big plays it's something that accustomed to and an office that is used to get lazy you want to get it it's not to stress a little bit and can become frustrated the Blitz Dalton has to get it away quickly Rex Ryan so creative with his exotic blitz packages and a defensive playbook that is buried deep here in Buffalo there you see dewpoint of 27 he's the free runner to the quarterback that something who came out because Rex Ryan's defense has allowed that free runner can hit your quarterback and knock him to the ground and forced the high throw out of bounds we ask Rex about near the Dalton the first thing out of his mouth was that game a couple of years ago and he was with the Jets Dalton lit him up for 40plus points a game that Rex has had a hard time forgetting about second attempt Dalton over the middle what a catch by Hewitt Duke Williams around his neck makes the catch any way 16 yards in another first down we told you some other players may have to make place for this offense today other than Tyler Eifert or AJ Green how about Ryan Hewitt I just played fullback to play tight in in this offense all he is good football player bursting 10 bangles and she put on the brain this is regard but one thing that this Bills defense has been awfully good at Solomon has been playing the wine through five plus weeks that's one of the things you have to do if you're gonna play a guessing Cincinnati Bengals offense can't allow them to have that kind of balance I think they've been good enough against this Bills defense today but not nearly as explosive that they would like to be not nearly as productive as they would like to do update on Sammy Watkins and easily the people who saw him on crutches outside the locker room is returned is questionable and the updates we get we will pass along as quickly as we can play clock down to three one second and eight bolts and airs it at down the middle of the field is caught miraculous catched by Marvin Jones Stephon Gilmore with him step for step had a Jones make that catch 42 yards down the fields actually good coverage by Stephon Gilmore but the fact that Marvin Jones really wanted this one he was running as fast as he could and laid himself out the go get that ball thrown by Andy dome seven back to the David Jones for just under 80 yards his bernard guarding over center plus is the 15 close to the 10 a majestic throw by dalton and an even better catch by Jones and take a look the safety here can't get over the top in time and that's where they split the defense and look at the speed and concentration of Marvin Jones to be able to get behind Duke Williams and Stefan Gilbert and that has been maybe the biggest area of improvement from Andy Dalton as you pointed out saw him and the accuracy on the deep throws through that geodon are not what they but here the Beals defensible but steps the pass to the wide receiver it's Jones once again zone touchdown Cincinnati Marvin Jones punctuating the brilliant drive with a trim yard tension one as he goes here born into the end zone one of the things that have really played this defense is communication or lack thereof they were trying to get lined up and trying to get matched up and again everyone wants to cover AJ green look he's blocking kicking out on the wide receiver screen too Marvin Jones and Jones did all the work on this Drive Vick play Katz down the field and hit why we see the screen to get it into the end zone third touchdown catch of the season for Jones a fourthyear white out out of now their former fifth round pick Cincinnati goes 90 yards eight plays in just over four minutes and sobbing all the attention that the Buffalo secondary is paying to AJ Green Jones has been a beneficiary how many times have we saved with this Cincinnati Bengals offense as you take a look at it there that's a great play that you gotta pick your poison I mean if you're gonna double O AJ Green or Tyler Eifert the other guys can be Marvin Jones Mohamed Sanu even the running backs coming out of the back while Ryan Hewitt hitting the involved on that drive this was the depth of Cincinnati just she's no Tyler I work out for all but one game Marvin Jones out the entire season with a broken foot it is a lethal AAPIs Jones the incredible catch and airborne into the endzone for 6 Andy Dalton surpassing his entire first half passing total on that drive alone and with the help Samet of Marvin Jones how long can't you keep them down okay they've got so many weapons Margaret Jones was able to get deep hauling in 1 for 42 yards and dogs gonna continue to give him a chance he did a really good job of reading the defense Dalton fivefootfive on the drive making 5 to 6 and a touchdown much Denarius more guess what a penalty marker is thrown towards the far side of the field it's 27 yard return for Moore who may have to play a little bit more as a wide receiver in the second half with the injury to Sammy Watkins who again at last check the bills saying his return is questionable with the ankle during the return holding return team number 58 at least 10 yards it is an epidemic for the Buffalo Bills and these penalties Randall Johnson is the culprit on that sequence Cincinnati in front you're watching the NFL on CBS the NFL on CBS is sponsored by Southwest transparency low fares nothing to hide out back for a limited time and steak and seafood is back and by Hyundai an official sponsor of the NFL Gotha happy fall activities here in Buffalo 24:14 Cincinnati first offensive possession to second for the bills is Sean McCoy is dumped out of the backfield Carlos Dunlap and Vinny arrange combine on the tackle here was the injury to Sammy Watkins on the 22 yard touchdown at the end of the first step on a jam that leg in the ground to try to support himself that's when it gave out he went down and now he's on crutches being examined by the medical field last week part is that his retirement about here's McCoy bounces to the edge crosses the 20 close to the first down marker reggie nelson and ray on the tackle we pick up 10 no signal yet now the officials say first sound builds and now what do you do here in the build I think you continue to work the shady McCoy his ability to get to the next level you can see 7,000 career rushing yards in his short career he's our home run hitter so if you're Greg Roman continue to feed him the ball then in the passing game I think if you can get the run game going play accent plays if gonna be there the Charles play at the next level of the D foot so good balance between right and pass if your Buffalo ready first eat Sam here's McCoy nice job boy it looked like he was about to spring free but Reggie Nelson who's had some big plays today for the Bengals able to get him around the ankles excellent tackle by Reggie noses because if you don't make this shoestring tackle look at that all he gives you is a foot it's enough to kid LeSean McCoy on the ground and you didn't make that tackle he's gonna run a long way so the job by reggie nelson looks like Vincent Ray is down on the play and Ray has been the focal point and the play caller for this defense trainer he's on to the field it appears to be a leg injury for Vinnie Ray's starting linebacker for Marvin Lewis play caller for this defense what a career he's built after coming back undrafted back in 2010 PJ Dawson for the moment second and seven passes caught Robert woods picks up eight and a first down for Buffalo so both teams now sound the dealing with some injuries to critical players and the Biggles have been really healthy so far this year we talked about some of the injuries setbacks they've had over the last couple of years well so far 2015 cross the fingers they did healthy there is Paul Dawson the replacement for Vinny ray third round pick out of Tennessee you are the Dolphins Albemarle former defensive player here good 12 conference were steeped in play this is McCoy minute Juke step aside mess in the blender plus is the 40 but another penalty marker thrown there's one or right around the line of scrimmage 7 yard run by McCoy and already you can hear the groans from 70,000 plus Tom and the current here Buffalo penalty flags on the field after a big play bills had a game in which they committed 17 penalties here against the Toyotas offense number 10 from tenyard penalty from the replay first down second holding penalty against woods today we go to New York and JB Coach thousand today's backup in Pittsburgh yeah Landry Joan right here up on North Davis blinds an eightyard touchdown his twopoint conversion failed when he thought Andrew Jones replaces Michael Vick whose return is questionable with a right hamstring injury Sparrow and Salomon injuries an issue for teams around the league apparently LeSean McCoy lines up by W scheme mr. funny after the penalty that pass is batted down the line of scrimmage it was Dunlap who got a hand on it Solomon's seven penalties against Buffalo totally 83 yards as Ray is gonna be carted into the Cincinnati locker room yeah that's a very good tackler good heady player for this defense remember they're already without vantes Burfoot they're spirited middle linebacker who's been out since the middle of last year now this backup Vincent Gray started every game so far this year he's out Paul Dawson is a very decorated player as you said having had played all but three offensive some season before today that's boom Herron on the catch brought down right around the 35 yard line they pick up nine the metal set up a third down coming up tackle on the play by a manual Lamar and saman that's difficult no not only is he an integral part but he's your play caller suddenly he goes out and now they have to shuffle the deck and react quickly I don't think people understand enough that that middle linebacker that inside linebacker is not like the quarterback the blue team communicate make all the checks it makes no the defenders get lined up and matched up with the opposing offense manual from the gun this is starting another the defense completes over the middle bit well short of the first down Chris Greg on their backup tight ends makes the catch for six but they will punt it is an ankle for venir a that all they've told us at this point is that his return is questionable as you see him going to be helped into the Cincinnati locker room was hate to see that the kid who has worked so hard after being undrafted to build his name go Schmidt said a couple of building an impressive deep in his audience I'm opposed that exact that it dances way across the twenty what a tackle look at the frustration by Jones this garrison Sanborn able to make the shoestring tackle the NFL on CBS is sponsored by Autotrader life happens one car search at a time and by McDonald's now serving allday breakfast Cincinnati Bengals first they have senior team to start a season five and OH since the NFL realigned in 2002 can they stay perfect up ten as Andy Dalton back onto the field of his actress hosting team just outside the 22 collected at the line of scrimmage and batted down incomplete coming up tomorrow on CBS the team of geniuses throw a Hail Mary to stop a bomb from landing in the wrong hands sketcher brilliant news scorpion tomorrow 9:00 8:00 central only CBS history outside Buffalo able to hold tackle by Mario Williams and Kyle Williams the talking Samet about Andy Dalton such a reflection of where this franchise is the battle scars of 4straight wanted done postseason appearances but confidence that this team is different yeah there's no doubt about to get the sense that this is a young team that's what a maturity coming through they're all there chastity I think evident that some of the winds that they have to this year they're going to be tested again here today but you get the sense that Andy Garden is up to the town certainly happen to this point his pass over the mansion place Mohamed Sanu upset with himself that maybe didn't have a little bit more after that catch what an effort by sinew 23 yards in a first down he's seen routes have been open against the Buffalo Bills all season long we saw the New York Giants take advantage of it we saw the Patriots atop Brady just caught this decompensating zebra he's whistled dead his Darby Jones gets something you know where I'm seeing something that Rex Ryan you know didn't want to have to do apparently some confusion Salomon so they burned the first two they're three timeouts I think you got to use that timeout it's a smart one because they're allowing receivers to get opened in the scene and this is an offense that can now pull away big time and so you've got to be able to do it in terms of calling that timeout as you can see they were able to get the timeout call so they could get matched up getting lined up and stop the bleeding right now this is Cincinnati Bengals off its capable of hitting a home run and they could pull it pull away big time on the scoreboard on this possession and one thing we should point out Rex Ryan has coached some of the best defenses in the NFL he's never beat my team with a top two weighted offense all six is wets all time has a hunch in those games first in ten jeremyhill inside Buffalo territory here is why Buffalo had to barn a timeout apparently saman they only had ten players on the field now let's go ahead and count them for you okay look at that ten guys there needed to get him to the line of scrimmage second and seven looks like near sights to new takes a hard hit Duke Williams among the players in the vicinity also Stephon Gilmore and now it'll be third and seven decision time to Hugh Jackson to the Bengals yeah you know for the bills is hard enough covering this Bingle's offense with 11 guys and look if they don't get out they're gonna snap it quick if I'm Andy dog you got to be able to go with the quick count and get the ball down the field six play the drive Dalton all day to throw looks down the fields gonna throw on the line it's caught AJ Green for the first down Green on a comebacker helping Dalton nine yards as they move the chains and how about the poise of dog he since the press it might be coming watch how long AJ Green is running this route and watch that long the rookie Ron dog he has to stay with him but every dog all day to stand in the pocket I didn't get the ball down the field AJ Green to print up the first ban on a Darby the windy apply the state NFL's Defensive Rookie of the Month and September tech strike this is green quiet in the first half now starting to make himself known Green entered the day fourth in the league in receiving yards that's his third catch Bureau can't say enough about the job the Cincinnati Bengals offensive line is doing against this front four they haven't been able to touch and edog that he's had time to throw the ball first attendance is hill is him up the middle close to the 20 in Samba you bring up a good point this is a Bills defense that last year led the league with 54 sacks just nine to the first five games this season what's been the reason for that well the Bengals are able to get I think good balance we just saw the run play there to play out hopes to hold that deeper try that bet is gonna push down and more at the play New England here in week two and knowing better than Brady and getting rid of the football quick as right now this defense on its heels that's something a lot of teams has been doing against this Bills defense I think one other reason why the Saxons are down Tom Brady got the ball out quick Eli did the same thing a few weeks ago last week about this Mariota able to get to the quarterback oh they still can Alton is evolving inside that came down to the five boy it was so critical for Buffalo to keep the points off the board and asked too much from EJ Manuel was making his first start in over a year first and goal and now there's defensive back on their heels they play Drive and they don't seem to have any zest or zeal to get to the quarterback or stop the run Bernard all blue Cernik defenders led by Marcel Darius Sabattus quiet as you'll hear Ralph Wilson Stadium all season this is what I think a lot of people in western New York has been talking about right now where is Jerry huge where's Marcel Garry's where's Kyle Williams Mario Williams on this the kid supply that led the league LSATs one year ago as you mentioned right now the Cincinnati Bengals offensive line spent on that defensive fight that's so far they've been it effective in this game well pointed the drive that started in an alternate it's Clark into the end zone by Tyler Eifert for the Cincinnati touchdown on them they go right at the power window and the bankers lead at 13 to 14 with the third can you be any more aggressive if your huge accident and he thought you see one on one outside the six six to fifty Tyler Eifert against Bakari Rambo this the oneonone matchup they've waited all day for and finally got it and Andy Dalton wasted no time he immediately went quick snap to get it over there to Tyler Eifert that monster game last Sunday and the comeback against Seattle sixth touchdown catch in six games this season and for Andy Dalton 62 is career he's throwing at least three touchdown passes 31:13 all Cincinnati you're watching the NFL on CBS well to the most important people in what has been a recordsetting start with his offense and this team at five and all Hugh Jackson on your right Andy Dalton on your left and Tyler Eifert whose return to this offense simply cannot be overstated thought I four did that at the beginning of the year Hugh Jackson called him in say hey get ready go catch a lot of balls gonna spoil out of 10 kept his prompts told it all throughout they'll believe a good time will come Solomon points out said gonna catch a lot of passes and those words have certainly come to fruition oh never miss a moment of football action with the CBS sports app and replay every story and every highlight right as they happen download the CBS sports app get it now at CBS sports.com slash mobile how about the two last possessions for Cincinnati as they have a silenced 70,000 plus it's going right down the field like they could dial it up whatever they want trying to bounce to the outside you have to feel a little bit solvent for this Buffalo offense just as they get Michonne McCoy and Sammy Watkins back lose Watkins again nothing official that he has done for the day but certainly didn't look good Crunchy's outside the lucky one this bills off it's not the grand Roma they're a run oriented often run first pass second this is the situation they did not want to be down on the scoreboard when you essentially have to throw in order to try to get back in it their offensive line does not built for primary protection and then you could see EJ Manuel tough the girl behind his intended receiver the tight end Charles clay reggie nelson playing good defense as we mentioned earlier after today they'll get on a plane fly the wanted tight for the next five games on the road certainly likes to go into that stretch by form two instead of three and three six she began looking in the direction of clay deflected by Adam Jones what an effort by him today she is slowly gonna be helped to his feet he is upset with himself you know why Adam knows he should have intercepted this one nice break on the ball look two hands right there it just goes right through his mitts but what a break on the ball by Adam Jones he knows he could have not only intercepted it would have returned it for a touchdown Jones will be a free agent at season's end I'll go out and elimin say that the Cincinnati wants to bring him back or two player he's become and his 9th NFL season his Colton Smith comes back onto the field a lot of concern right now on that Buffalo sideline 31:13 booming kick and skip granted Tate's gonna play it from just inside his 30 when coverage down the field by Buffalo 47 yards on the point as Manny Lawson brings tape down after a pickup of only 4 Andy Dalton nearly perfect last week in the fourth quarter in overtime saman that's carried into today he's a bit business coming out here in the second half $42 Ain go to Barbara Jones in a little flip wonder why we see the screen to finish off with gel started but then Mohamed Sanu just another Arsenal another weapon in that Arsenal should say then Tyler Eifert talented tight in getting the ball into the end zone for Andy dog he's got more weapons in this offense and he's used it every single one of them Sammy Watkins now officially quick strike that's AJ clean at the 46 and a first down Samus so much talk about Andy Dalton and shortcomings in the playoffs I think so many people have undervalued what he's accomplished in his career and at the league in 2011 no lockout but with the lockout no offseason a try has led this team of four straight postseason appearances which really in this day and age is remarkable son unprecedented period of winning in Cincinnati Bengals franchise history under their coach Marvin Lewis and these are young proof of players he and AJ Green came in the same year and I think we want that microwaveable quarterback he's been is we lead us to championships but I think you have to really be honest that there's been a growth in a development pattern for Andy Dalton that if she don't just continue to grow year and year out it I think we're now seeing him right in his wheelhouse in that zone that you want for a championship quarterback start of the fourth quarter 3114 I mean that was 1714 since you know on the third quarter now trying to put this guy down on Cherry Hill using 6 foot 1 inch 235 frame getting downhill 9 yards and Hill somnus the best that he's looked and a couple of weeks now you go back to a couple of weeks ago against Kansas City remember he rushed for three touchdowns in that game so you know they're really just playing it based on personnel both running backs are gonna have great numbers by the end of the year strike on a second one here's John's what a brilliant day he's had first down catch and run eight yards as we go to New York and JP here's how you earn a nickname coach yeah they call him big play Barnidge it's Gary Barnidge that tight in his second touchdown of the day this one from 14 yards his fifth touchdown of the year they cut the larger with Denver Denver 16 Cleveland 14 spero Dedes and Solomon Wilcox nor what a huge women that would be for Cleveland as week six continues around the NFL you see what the Browns have done as they look for their first win against team 500 or better first attempt Dalton this operates supremely confident of 17 points as a penalty mark rare mistake by a Dalton's offense I think dog just kind of lost track of the clock a little bit could have gotten that ball snapped before he ran out of time there but you know coach Marvin Lewis talked about the need to start fast and finish strong something they did one week ago against Seattle and so you think with a lead they have here the fourth water their stability to put more points on the board first and 15 thus a boy at his man and was soon knew about a half step down the seam in complete coverage buying the Cal robe with it impressively they're still looking for more points as we said that's Mohamed Sanu he had the step on the kale Roby and we talked about Dalton usually being very accurate with the long ball that time he overshot muhammad's to do look at the numbers he stood up here to set up and say by distance 10 yards down here Dalton 8429 touchdown passes hill breaks three crosses 2:35 yearly to the thirty glory gram finally on the tackle but not before Hill picks up ten yards to set up third down you could see Jerry Hill he after that play wanted to go back to the huddle hoping to get another snap now he's coming off you know he and Giovanni Bernard having to split time and sort of share plays bet he's got to take advantage of those opportunities when you get up well so far 12 rushes 50yard says the super guard now split up was the bottom of your screen bus and ran over the middle insolvent so many different spots as this offense is really built around night group has a tight end something you rarely see or look at that's why receiver like skills in the space it gets a quarter they're using their shutdown corner Stephon Gilmore against Tyler Eifert out on the perimeter the line of scrimmage I've written had that incredible catch on that gametying driving the end of regulation last week we asked them about it he said his his basketball skills and the old divers into the pool when he was a kid with his buddies kind of helped him to that moment but really there's no catch that this guy can't make he talked about his basketball is it kind of looked at us you know sense of confidence in if I'm going to play basketball I worked at it because it was his batter of fact the hoop joining the guys hard that day Dalton pump fakes collapses Dalton gonna buy himself some time applaud out of bounds you know i firts pop greg play it at purdue he was actually a member of gene keys first recruiting class for his college basketball coach at Purdue I'm for the high school start and hoops in Fort Wayne Indiana says he still has moments as you mentioned where he kind of wishes he stuck two hoops but what a player what a career he's got in front of him in the NFL he credits his basketball skills for being able to come down those tough ik catches he talked about he said it's really like rebounding you have to be able to tie in it's not about how high you could jump that the ability to time it perfectly got to complete saguni to the 18 for the first boy gram on to tackle t pick up six Marvin Lewis will send out his field goal unit the tackle by Corey Graham short of the first down marker on Sidhu then tough to get Andy Dalton in this often it's off the field here in the second half saw me just look around the stadium of a sense of deflation this crowd is jacked up letting a chance for the village to make a statement in the AFC after some disappointing losses here at home but Cincinnati will build on its lead 20 as Mike Nugent bangs it through the uprights Thursday night your weekend starts here with the Seahawks and the Niners in a showdown and the NFC West Thursday Night Football CBS NFL Network 20point lead for Cincinnati they have been dominant since halftime this was a threepoint game most undefeated teams in the NFL entering week six since the merger in 1970 there was six of them before Atlanta lost on Thursday bangles of course looking for their third 6a no start franchise history Denver right now a slim lead in Cleveland backers coming up next on CBS and a Patriots of play later tonight five remaining unbeaten in the NFL tough out Patriots team we know for real Cincinnati equally dominant so far this season the time plenty of questions that they'll be asking here at Buffalo

insurance on the Ralph Wilson statue of the late iconic owner of the Buffalo Bills passed away in March of 2014 and the legacy he's left to you in western New York first eat any champion over the middle that's caught by the backup tight end Chris Greg the former seventh round pick out of Arkansas 14 yards and a villas first down so obviously a lot of disappointments Amon with where this game is but what have you seen from Manuel and his first start in the year I think it's been an even performance I think he can play better it can be law consistent with some of these throws but I think you see it improved it from what we saw from there one year ago 40 as we go to New York at an update with JB and coach peihgee's ninth pick Debussy's and the boys a Denver offense suffering watch right here as Carlos dance he's going to step in front pick this off for 35 yards the interception returned for a touchdown as pates ninth interception the year third straight game with two interceptions they lead that being Cleveland 20 to 16 in the fourth 18 through 15 all of last season back to score Oneidas 9 picks from Peyton Manning unbelievable turn of events in Cleveland Chris Gregg's forward progress looks like to take him across the 45 it'll give Buffalo a first down you know you talked about EJ man you got a lute he's got to use the fourth quarter here today and use this as meaningful time on the football field they're gonna be heading to London Tyrod Taylor I'm sure wants back in there so this is an opportunity for EJ maybe close the distance between he attained shortcuts putting a couple of times now speaking of Tyrod Taylor you know he was chomping at the bit a to get back and B to be under Center Salman with a full arsenal hasn't had much of a chance to play with Sammy Watkins in LeSean McCoy but now you have to wonder about Watkins and his status with that ankle injury like a Taylor completed 70 percent of his passes their first five games that's rather impressive far side boy likes trips ahead to the 30 inside Cincinnati territory 22 yards and a buffalo first down and these plays are meaningful for EJ Manuel start to establish himself and thought move the offense put more points on the board the key is at the quarterback position with every play and every possession you got to compete to put points on the board and move the office Bangla Sean Witt submission in zone Hogan gets tangled up with Adam Jones fans wanted a penalty no flags as we go back to New York in an update with JB painting isn't competitive but yeah I didn't take long for Payton to respond he finds Emmanuel Sanders down the right side 75 yards it's the first touchdown for a new for the Denver offense in 27 drives they now take the lead back from Cleveland 23 to 23 they're all soggy somebody else coach how far did he throw it he said just far enough back to Spiro hey guys the 39 year old quarterback isn't done yet that's incredible isn't he nothing take long those will take their second timeout those groans continue here in Buffalo timeout pills down to their last timeout down 24 miners stay tuned for the NFL today update presented by the oldtime reading I send you to the guys in New York get you caught up week six multiple caches it'll be his fourth reception to take him over 30 yards and a first down for the bills as they pick up ten meaningful minutes for Greg also as they start to incorporate a second tight in and to Greg Rama's often something he did frequently when he was in San Francisco remember the days of Vernon Davis Delanie Walker Titans helped fuel that offer his legs inside the tan you forget insolvent about how athletic and mobile he is 16 yards on the ground first and goal pills how about EJ Manuel visit down the field I'll see like right now he's looking at the defense tucking it brother like to see him keep his eyes up to tell you mrs. McCoy using his legs into the end zone first rushing touchdown for LeSean McCoy as a Buffalo Bill and I thought that fourth quarter we talked about eej man has got to use these Fitness to show he could take the possession put points on the board for his offense get just past mates really nice throws good decisions with the football running it himself and then giving it to McCoy for the

trucks loaded as the bills will head to the airport later tonight make that transatlantic flight to London or they'll take on the Jaguars next Sunday sidekick about up in beach if you will bouncer up the field trying to catch Cincinnati offguard they were not fooled as Brandon tape is able to fall on the football well speaking of that one next week next Sunday wake up and watch with the world for the first time ever the NFL is streaming a live game on Yahoo it'll be Bill's Jaguars live from London October the 25th next Sunday at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time you can learn more at yahoo.com slash NFL stream so saman that will be up a little bit longer than played for Buffalo Canada can't come up with some kind of magic here over the last six and champs by Buffalo right now I'm gonna keep playing you got one timeout left it's a three it out right here get the ball back for your office I'm unable to get out of bounds so the clock that's exactly what he wanted and keep that clock running down 30 X 30 to play in this fourth quarter yeah they're down 13 so two touchdowns for EJ Manuel Greg Roman as you can see them right there plotting their course just in case they get the opportunity but if you're the defense how about getting the tunnel how about making the play in this ball game right now you have taking the ball away from this Bengals off that's all day they push it 53 yeah big bucks connected right here this bangles offense has been so shorthanded all season long that's Charlie Hill minimal pick up bird down as Buffalo will desperately try to get off the field Preston Brown and Manny Lawson on top but Ryan's defense as good as they were the beginning of this game see bingos off its on third down today about 60% spills deepens have plays you always have one time we'll get the twominute warning as well 37 he's got that more first down Cincinnati I may be able to run down that clock a little bit more an inside zone read one cut get going down here love the way Giovanni Bernard tacks the line of scrimmage he's healthy this year he's running much better came in averaging over five yards per carry today that's Kyle Williams Pro Bowler for the last five years heart and soul of his defense as if they haven't had to deal with enough in the injury category already lost Sammy Watkins today to an ankle injury busy day for those bills trainers tears to be the left leg there you see on five layers yep that's it right there out boy I can't even look they get anchored that way if someone falls down on their leg as you saw they're holding his left knee put them in a very vulnerable position what a career Williams is had former fifth round pick actually he and DOMA top Peko whose headliner that Cincinnati defensive line since oh six the year that they both came into the NFL they've ranked one to being tackles among all NFL defensive tackles so much mutual respect between them and now all the concern on that bill sideline on Kyle Williams and you could see the respect Solomon from the Cincinnati players coming over to make sure that he's okay hope he's able to walk off here he is right there as he's engaged and I think they're gonna see someone fall right there on the back of his leg there looked like his own guide Manning Lawson like he's able to put some weight on it Stefan Charles will come in to replace him there is no replacing Kyle Williams who's been doing it here in Buffalo for the last decade he's a worker I remember during the summer when everyone was so excited about this team and the direction they promise and what did he say hey we haven't done anything yet let's let's go out and earn it before you start the praises I thought it was the right approach and if they can't come back in this game today they're gonna fall into three or three and they've gotta cross the pond go over to London they've got their work cut out for him you know Jackson girls don't play them hard but you know sit here at 500 after six games it's not the way they intended to start the season have any injuries Solomon starts to mount we mentioned Watkins percy harvin out this was such a brutal sport such a cool sport a little bit more air comes out of that bill is believed with Reuters seems to the Diamondbacks Jeremy hill buried in the back Els dinner what Manny Lawson and Charles who just came in for Williams dumped him for a loss of four they will cart Williams into the Buffalo locker room and that cart driver has had a busy day unfortunately hurry that clock down as much as they can as we move under 4 minutes let's start to look ahead for these teams how about Cincinnati got a bye week next week will be a happy we call from Marvin Lewis and his bunch and they go to Pittsburgh Salomon and a hope game on Thursday Night Football here on CBS against Cleveland yeah despite getting off to a five what six and old start after today's game if they hold on to the lead still not enough to breathe easy if you're Marvin Lewis at the Cincinnati Bengals the AFC North know it's not going anywhere needed to fit see well short and so the bill is able to get off the field mahalo takes his third and final timeout rex trying to save those precious seconds will burn his final timeout we mentioned the upcoming schedule at least next week for the bills hopping on a plane they'll fly to London tonight take on Jacksonville and Gus Bradley next week then the bye and week 8 for them and then a couple of divisional games three consecutively Miami the Jets that'll be a big one and then they go to New England Sally in late November yeah two of them on the road and even coming back home again to my advocacy later you got to start winning games at home if you're the Buffalo Bills and then you get to that stretch on the road in your division you got to start to still a game look the bills in danger have fallen to one in three at home two of those losses potentially they're being lopsided fashion their cat signaled by the Marius Mar what a day Kevin Huber's had 52 yards on the punt as they pin him back inside the vibe coming up next Phillip Rivers and the Chargers take on Aaron Rodgers of the Packers at Lambeau Field or some of you will see the Ravens visit the 49ers check your local listings on CBS Aaron Rodgers nearly perfect at home staggering numbers look at the touchdowns the interception ratio Salman assists video game length with what he's done he's there a perfect period all wore away where's the tent you're from his own hands on post is on the field as Charles clay will be clays seven catch as he moves over 50 yards on the afternoon he said a glaze the most consistent opponent of his offense something Nathan field around it's got to get healthy on the panhandler I have four receivers making plays reported on second azusa close that he's completed was clay unable to get out of balance what a play by Chris Patrick is a smart tackle wasn't it he literally quoting right back in bounds made sure that he didn't get out the clock is gonna stop anyway because Michael Johnson he is hurt behind the line of scrimmage Johnson returning to Cincinnati after rocky one year free agent stint in Tampa Bay last season there's Drakkar Patrick going up on clay look at that just that's a head superlight that's a really smart headsup play to keep him in bounds that keep clay from stopping the clock for Patrick another first round player in Marvin Lewis is secondary guy he who like so many of these other players that Marvin has had has had to wait his turn waited three years to become a starter something that the dark quest Denard is going through right now that's all part of this system and the way that they've built this Cincinnati franchise yeah their ability to draft and develop Marvin Lewis talked about it yesterday in terms of hey they know now that's that's the way it's done and so you don't have to talk about it no sense of complaining you've got to earn your right to be able to get on the field and I hope that Michael Johnson is okay Johnson has had some good seasons for the bangles as you take another look at the injury there he is wearing number 90 you see him just kind of spin around and throw manual to the turf tried to get to his feet and then just kind of falls into a heap we got hurt tackling the quarterback 11 and a half sacks for the Bengals back in 2012 former thirdround pick back in 2009 Johnson didn't miss the preseason with a knee injury we've all gone through all the depth that he's had with this defensive line is able to some of these guys fresh so right now Johnson helped into the locker room who's gone through second season as Marvin Lewis his defensive coordinator first examiner's manual over the middle it's caught this is Greg again able to run out of bounds just inside the 35 that'll stop the clock so one more play before the twominute warning they pick up 19 Chris Greg I'll tell you this coven looked pretty good five catches 54 yards so far in this game it's made good use of his time on the field he had only one catch entering today until a lot of his work has come after Cincinnati manual sex it's done left most sex in the NFL that is his sixth of the season Carlos Dunlop making plays getting into the quarterback Cincinnati Bengals often deepness best teams any way you want it to serving it up second and 17 for EJ Manuel to the bills by the two minutes rare drop from Charles clay as that'll set up a third and long coming up special thanks to our crew here our producer director Ryan Galvin and Goldberg rested the game in the truck Ilana Campbell's Stefan flora Val Adam Colin and here in the booth our statistician Russ tool in in our spotter rich Dana also a day Ellis almost forgotten parachuting into helpless Buffalo today 13:17 right after the cats after the 30 and the tackled by a drag cook Patrick Sami give me your concern meter if you're a Bills fan after today you go to London obviously they'll try to pick up the pieces against Jacksonville but you're a 500 team now on the Rex Ryan after six weeks you know it's pretty hot to be honest you'd be because they came into the 2015 season with so much promise and really so much swagger that this stuff exists right now look at this pass by Chris Holden welcome off the deflection incredible concentration 24 yards as they pick up a first down North 67 seconds remaining EJ Manuel quickly up the hill to spike it and stop the clock as Buffalo is out of timeouts we go to New York in an update here's JB Cleveland putting up plenty of fight yeah then 30 left to go Travis coos he kicks his 26yard field goal to tie the game 23 23 let's see if Payton can do his magic again in the third one 25 left in regulation back to Sparrow and Solomon 20 JB so uh Cleveland trying to stay close to come up with what would be a huge home one what about those ASU or feelings they don't quit errant pass by EJ Manuel at exactly a minute left in the fourth quarter and Zalman a little tip of the cap to you and I you're a little bit under the weather but basically outside here it's been cold are you talking about fine great I could hear the sniffles a little bit that that for you well you know you don't up weak Pro hot the cold winter kind of set in on a few of us through the early look at that guy even from western New York it gotta look sealed boy at the world we pulled in you this morning over people with their shirts off drinking beers and Brazil one of the day some great fans here that are used to it temperatures right colder than this as Robert Woods makes the catch penalty marker on the field way back behind the line of scrimmage if it stands it's a 15yard play looked like it may be coming back all the billows fans have seen this movie before holding offense number 76 10yard penalty replay third down fourth penalty against Buffalo fourth holding penalty I should say that one against the rookie John Miller they're a third round pick out of Louisville Rex is not going to be happy on that long flight to London later tonight and why manual was merely hit on a release another disappointment added to Rex Solomon against his old colleague in Baltimore Marvin Lewis coached together for three years some recordsetting defenses you knew that he wanted this one from a personal standpoint badly yeah Marvin Lewis you know his program is so much further along right now then Rex Ryan here in Buffalo Rex got some building to do they've got some coaching to do to get this team ready to play take the shot and overthrow his woods and that will do it as the mass exodus to the parking lot is on there at the ralph 34 to 21 as the Cincinnati Bengals are seconds away from matching the best start in their franchise history well we told you that Buffalo wanted to try to minimize the number of throws you don't design a game plan where you're gonna say EJ Manuel threw it 42 times in the game and go out and win it for if they want to be able to run it and have enough throws to be able to create some plays but this inanity bengals offense it's just too hard to keep up with it putting points on the board in the bunches he only can hope that kaya Williams and Sammy Watkins injuries are not as serious as they looked as the final seconds tick off the clock final score 34 to 21 Cincinnati wins it bonus coverage coming up next here on cbs4 salmon will cut our CBS crew spirit leaders saying goodbye from Buffalo we go to New York and JB",

  "transcript": "hello friendship the Hanceville since quick thought before kickoff they're ready to go just a quick thought the New England Patriots probably the best offensive the National Football League so for the Dallas Cowboys Brandon Weeden making his third start you got to take off the reins man you got to go for it and score some points and a lot of them to beat this Patriots team this game is being broadcast in Spanish were available using the sa P button on your television the Cowboys won the toss and will receive the football lucky white head is back deep remember they just lost Lance Dunbar for the season in the game against New Orleans but not even close to a chance to return this one so Brandon Weeden coming out for his third consecutive start look what he's done so 76 percent completion percentage played well Jim but if you look at the lineup we'll talk about that later Tyron Smith in anyways the anchor of that outstanding offensive line Jason Witten he's moving in on a thousand career catches only 36 away Whedon led the Cowboys on a gametying touchdown drive in New Orleans only to see the Saints win it in overtime last Sunday night here's the handoff and it's Randall getting the first carry for a couple and you know you've been breaking down all the tape everything you've seen so far of Weeden tells you what I think he's played it very well being a backup quarterback replacing the guy like Tony Romo and what he's done for this offense he's made good decisions made big throws we saw it last week last minute drive against the New Orleans Saints they have lost the two games that he has started but he absolutely is not the cause they lost to Atlanta here two weeks ago and then again at New Orleans last Sunday after two opening wins here's a actions bake and the roll out by weeding down the sideline and the antman their street but the pass was off the mark here's the Patriot defense Chandler Jones back in the 2012 draft was taken with the pic before Whedon the very selection before Whedon went with the first round to Cleveland Mayo their captain and of course Butler their hero in the Superbowl down in Arizona in February Bill Belichick in his Patriots playing in this stadium for the first time last appeared in Davos back in O seven at the old Texas Stadium on their way to an undefeated regular season third and eight and Whedon now on the field it goes a name is trying to find Terrence Williams that was Harmon who came over to help out with Butler on the coverage they do this a lot any time they see the defense has shifted to the other side Brandon Weeden will take these oneonone shots down the field they're no they're hybrid not highrisk Tim but it's just hard to hit those type of plays that time double coverage on Jason Witten so typical Bill Belichick he's gonna take away your number one passing threat Amendola waits for the punt from Chris Jones the left fetid footed booter some serious hang time in rhinoland straddling the sideline Amendola makes the catch takes it up to the 31 so Brady and the Patriots this is Tom's 100 straight start in the second time in his career he's had a streak that lasted at least a hundred consecutive off to this fabulous beginning with rookie Center Brady with six touchdowns no picks through their first three games Gronkowski of course always the man to watch and as they break huddle you can see the Cowboys are gonna put their rookie first rounder on a Aaron Jones as Gronkowski split to the nearside the rookie on him that's what New England thought that they would put the number one pick on Rob Gronkowski so they found out right away with the formation Rainey wide open Edelman 4050 to the cowboy 47 then a huge opening at a flag thrown in on the sidelines after the tackle on the play that went for 21 it was JJ Wilcox who shoved them out of bounds two mistakes right away of course the personal foul hitting out of bounds tight mantoman coverage you are going to get Jim you're gonna have traffic problems when you're going with Edelman get him in motion come across the field Morris Claiborne has he man the man he's got his fight his way but through his own players and the receivers for the Patriots and that's a hit way out of bounds so when you play tight coverage here we go got it again you've got to be alert for picks crossing each other tremendous amount of number of plays the Patriots can run against this one gotta think Brady can't wait to try to get Gronkowski involved with that oneonone coverage and the Cowboys in quickly on the quarterback who tried to dump it off to Dion Lewis here's this cowboy defense this being the Dallas debut for Greg Hardy more about his return shortly Shawn Lee had that concussion last week he's out there McClain just put the pressure on Brady he had missed the first four games the first four games of the season suspended and Clayburn and should see a lot of you would think Edelman today in a matchup second and ten in pressure pretty quickly and is broken up by Shawn Lee second straight play Brady threw it in the direction of Lewis they love that matchup on the outside Shawn Lee number 50 watching come from the inside and make the play Tom Brady there's great car D coming around the left side get some quick pressure on Nate's older but still that's not the problem the Patriots get rid of the football so fast it makes it difficult free lead pass rushers to get back there in this luck whoever he's trying to throw the football to well it's a third and ten and the blitzing its McClain and they take them out of field goal range with the sack and Hardees there as well the two defenders who are playing for the first time this season busted across and got to braid yeah but claimed 55 it's a different look it's a threeman line and if you're a veteran quarterback Sean leads also on the Blitz threeman line and situations like that you know it's gonna be a defense you probably haven't seen before and we saw the game plan right there Cowboys defense very aggressive today is what they want to do in this game today Ryan Allen on the punt it bounces at the six and comes back about five or six yards this the first Patriot punt in their last 25 drives in their last game that coming off a bye but two weeks ago against Jacksonville they scored on their first nine possessions their tenth possession was just basically running out the clock so Lyon Avenue hadn't seen much action for a while it's called on here on the first series of the game and downs the Cowboys at about the 12 make it the 13 never miss a moment of football action with the CBS Sports app every playing every story every highlight right as they happen download the CBS sports app now CBS sports.com / mobile well you know you want to know controversial Greg Hardy will talk about him in a minute is he going to have an impact get a pretty big one there in that first drive against the Patriots off that man he was in twice on Brady and first down carry it's Randall who pause for a moment that helped him and he picks up five yards so since so Whedon came out of Oklahoma State drafted by the Browns first round pick back then this is his 24th career start and you see of course the numbers the winning numbers for Brady during that same time well Brandon Weeden here today and since he's been with the Cowboys I'm not knocking Cleveland he's learning how to be a quarterback getting the huddle talk to the guys communicate be a leader make chips at the line of scrimmage things he never did in college have never got good enough at Cleveland on second and that's Randall and couldn't get around Collins except maybe to Tony Romo with that broken clavicle expected to be out right up to week 11 of course he's on that IR with the ability to return a lot of things are saved you talk about this call a cowboy offense Brandon Weeden is executing a lot of things well but there's a little magic with Tony Romo in other words third and five if it's not there he can move around and make it happen those are things that Brandon weed me hasn't done enough of yet I expect him to see be more active today short three third down and here comes the sack by Hightower Dante Hightower all over weed and then a loss of nine looks like we got a fast track out there today and you know what I mean by that up the middle Oh Dante hats our shows his ability McFadden goes low knocks him down but it never gets hands and feet jumps right up and makes the sack what a play by Hightower New England a very good inside blitzing team with these big linebacker so each defense comes up with third down sax and Jones now coming for the second time as back to the 34m and DOMA that's some good blocking on that left side and it takes it all the way to the cowboy 45 brought down by lattice or the long snapper for the Cowboys 59 yard punt 25yard return I mentioned this is the first time the Patriots have played at a TMZ stadium last time they were down this way October repose 7 Randy Moss caught a touchdown West Welker caught Wow grainy caught one and Donte Stallworth caught another Brady in all Tom Brady five touchdown passes in a 48:27 victory Jason Garrett back then was the Cowboys offensive coordinator that season from the gun first down snap from the Dallas 45 it's over to Louis what an addition he has been down to the Cowboys 30 almost the same play we saw earlier the difference is it's a blitz inside by Shawn Lee so he can't come flying out there to help Barry Church Dion Lewis fast and run routes tough matchup here comes hardy on Brady and he's got the sack oh my gosh with it that was easy the speed of Greg Hardy premiere pass rusher in the NFL he got right around Nate's older lose a good starting left tackle this will make the Patriots think about now what are you gonna do on the offensive side Jim maybe put a formation there but you have to do some different things because you've you match him up oneonone the Cowboys told us he's ready to go second and 17 and give it to Lewis Church rides him down so Greg Hardy you've heard the stories no doubt all week convicted back in the summer of 14 of domestic abuse by a judge in North Carolina played one game for the Panthers last year then spent the rest of their getting paid on the commissioners exempt list his initial conviction by the judge dismissed on appeal after he reached the settlement and his accuser did not show up for the next trial here's a little throw to Amendola for a couple anyway given a 10 game suspension later reduced to four games by an independent arbitrator now here he is playing for the first time talks to the media this week says these absolutely outrageous unrepentant remarks that you know you talk to some people in Dallas and they thought that well hey you know the guy was just trying to be funny there was nothing funny about it there was a bill goal try coming up from Gaston ski from 49 yards there's a lot to say about Greg Hardy people's opinion the public the fans here in Dallas him being back in the game but no question what a difference here early physically he's made in this game so a 49 yard field goal by Gaston ski this is what we were just talking about precision they're in Carolina 2013 and again only one game last year on that commissioner's exempt list signed a deal with alice in march suspension reduced you thought you might see some contrition from him when he met with the media this week but it was anything but that well listen you know the cowboys they did their work every team always says that we thoroughly went through it i understand they talk to high school friends to coaches they did it all but here's the point Jim you know everybody deserves a second chance I understand all that but if he wasn't borderline I mean he could be a great player in the NFL would he still be out there if he wasn't such a dynamic player because make no mistake about it Greg Hardy this team is healthy is good enough to turn this team into a Super Bowl contender I think that's how good he is here's the kickoff agains gonna bring a touch back you know it's like take the best player in NBA team does he make everybody else better of course so that's kind of what you get with him you can see the speed and everything that's going on with him out there to field already but we talked to Jason Garrett in our meetings leading up to the game and he was obviously not very happy at all with Hardy the way he presented himself this week for the first time before the media he addressed it immediately says that's not how we want to operate as an organization we do not draw attention to ourselves distinguish yourself on the field not off that's what you say that's what they've said that's what all NFL teams won from the players so the Cowboys with their third handle of the game and Wheaton I'm just gonna dump it off to Randall for about five they've had a couple of three announced here at the start there's one thing that hits me you know that's the first to England game we've done this year as you look out there now the Cowboys they fit the mode of what you want the NFL they are big and fast on both sides of the ball this New England front now as you look out in the field this is one big unit so and not only that they are deep and play a lot of guys on second and five Randle running off the right side put two more now the Cowboys of course lose in the off season DeMarco Murray signs a free agent deal with Philadelphia last year really Murray did all the heavy lifting for them as far as rushing the football they still missing look what they're missing out of this lineup this is incredible now here's your skill set from last year and here's what we have today hope Beasley's becoming a big part of things around here stepping up we did quarterback Randall but running back Williams and Witten remain plus they've lost Lance Dunbar for the season as of last week here's the third and three and not a chance as cottons again comes flying across the line there is a flag out how fast was towns able to get right past the Dallas offensive front every time you do a game in New England you go wow this 91 keeps getting better it's caught on shared jabal sheared from cleveland great addition to the team on the outside he's going against Jason Whitney what he's doing let's hold him up at the line of scrimmage make it easy for our safety Devin McCourty who's in annex corner who can cover these big guys make it easier on him so here we are third sir that's the second different defense I've seen on Jason Witten they're gonna make Brandon Weeden Scott Linehan the offensive coordinator they're gonna make them find a different way to throw the football and not just not the Jason Witt first Cowboys first down comes by way of penalty choose to run it on first down as Randall for three we've got an update enough final is in on horn Cleveland Cheney he has it in New York rounds were down by as much as 12 in the second half that's Travis Kunz that's a 32yard field goal 33 30 they go on to beat the Baltimore Ravens Josh McCown fill 457 yards passing today improve to two and three back to Jim Nance Phil Simms and Tracy Wolfson and we got Dante thank you fellas Dante Hightower is getting a lot of attention here which is very concerning for this patriot defensive unit but 457 yards passing by McCown today nope nobody wants to hear you know listen he can throw the ball and he's a good athlete even in his age we saw what he did in Chicago but you know we always wipe them off and I gave you some of the numbers the backup quarterbacks how they're playing in the year not that he's got a backup backup quarterbacks the NFL 12 touchdowns five interceptions completing basically 70% of their passes that's pretty good stuff and just when we thought having seen the Ravens win at Pittsburgh on Thursday night at 11 days ago we thought perhaps that was gonna save their season and get their season jumpstarted they back it up with a loss at home today it's the same game Tim Joe Flacco gets in the lead it's late in the game they give it up they lose that's what happened to him at at Oakland let's see their coming coach Belichick even came out to make sure his player he's improving year by year Hightower I'd like to welcome those of you who were watching the Cleveland Browns win in Baltimore 33 to 30 June Nance Phil Simms Tracy Wolfson here in Arlington Texas where the Cowboys are down three nothing here first quarter off a steep Gaston ski 49 yard field goal cowboy offensive line off to a really shaky start against his front in the blitzes second and eight and Randle he had no chance right down the line they ran with them including Malcolm Brown and Jamie Collins who's had an active start if you want to lose your job with the New England Patriots be an edge player an outside linebacker or a defensive end and let a run get to the outside you will be taken out and then you might wait weeks before you get your job back you'll have to earn it through practice and through bit of playing time as you get as time goes along so they know how to set the edge they're gonna make you run inside to their big people and those big linebackers Randle six carries only 14 yards third down and eight there was jumping on each side let's see who they're gonna call it against defense number fifty so far down think about the New England Patriots is still amazing me mad Patricia defensive coordinator Jim does anybody have just one role a defense defensive ends in inside pass rusher linebackers they pass rush on third there inside outside you got safeties at play corner you got to be multitasking especially play in the defensive side on third and three a flag is out as Whedon connects with Terrence Williams 411 will check the flag Jim Nance Phil Simms Tracy Wolfson in all the cruel and Sparrow Mike Arnold down in the truck welcoming now many of you from across the country getting here for the very first time opening quarter action here between the Cowboys and the Patriots this is the third possession of the game already for this Cowboys offense two three and outs and now they've moved it down the field thanks on one occasion to a penalty against the Patriots on a third and short and we've got another flag out here as the Cowboys thought they had converted on third and three on this occasion sixtyfive million years from the hands defense number 25 those fouls will offset will replay third down and for those just joining us we've had two Patriot possessions the first time they got as deep as the cowboy 32 before Tom Brady was sacked on third down it's been sacked twice already in this game but on their second possession that sack took him out of field goal range their second possession ended with a Gaston ski 49 yard field goal so now caught up here we go third and three Cowboys from their own 42 man it's Beasley for the first but that right in front of Terrell brown Rena sinks sorry Jim what do you do Cole Beasley great on third and short stacking behind the other receiver now you got to back off number 25 Terrell brown has to fight his way through a receiver can't get there quick enough and that's what you need there's no doubt being aggressive with Cole Beasley is what they want to do and be aggressive against Jason Witten disrupt the timing of them going down the field first down they've run it every time on first and this time it's an open lane for Randall for a pickup of 13 make it 14 beautiful blocking on the right side the center of that time Travis Frederick seals off sack Martin gets a good block and this cowboy running game nice cut by Randall listen it's not as good as last year one nobodies DeMarco Murray but two teams are playing the tendency they are a huge first down running team so if they are they're putting two blitzing linebackers up there and they killed three tight ends back to Randall with the last home game two weeks ago in against Atlanta scored three touchdowns and had over 90 yards rushing in the first quarter Thursday Night Football Atlanta won today and overtime to remain undefeated they'll be down in New Orleans we head to the NFC South Atlanta and New Orleans your weekend starts here with Thursday Night Football mountains off to this fast start they win it on a pick six Drew Brees and the Saints will be hosting not able to back up their win against Dallas last Sunday they got trounced today in Philadelphia a lot of trouble in New Orleans down second and eight zips it incomplete that was Whitehead unable to hold on to it McCourty helped knock it out of his hands yeah really good job how about Devin McCourty I'm watching him boy he's like I said safety Jason Witten now you seen covering a wide receiver Whitehead that throw pretty good could have been about another three or four feet in front of the receiver and maybe McCord he would not have got to him what are you seeing out of Wheaton here at the start well you know I like what I see being comfortable the defense is being aggressive let the games settle in so in other words he's not getting getting frantic because they blitz the battling this way it'll settle down the decisions will become was trying to go low and find that first down yardage but he's a yard or two short then within doubt on third down grow to 11 he is so quick you know Jim you heard it Brandon Weeden said it's almost impossible to cover him when he's inside receiver oneonone and we've seen that in the short time here today I was gonna try to tie it on a Dan Bailey 51yard field goal attempt he's 6 for 6 at the start of the season whose Bailey's kicked from 51 and it is easily and dead center and the Cowboys match the Patriot kick from earlier in the quarter Jerry Jones the owner president and general manager of the Cowboys has been such since back in the late 80s sitting alongside the chairman of CBS Leslie Moonves who just recently celebrated his 20th anniversary and the network in the back of the endzone that'll set up the Patriots when we return at the 20 Rainey 3 for 5 at the start for 37 yards and he's been knocked down twice on sacks little heart ate barbeque Tom Brady always on Saturday night on road games treats the offensive line to dinner in the hotel and that's what he did last night well here and you run an offense like this you keep the big boys happy and the best way to keep an offensive lineman happy of course feeding 1st and 10 once his perception and a flag is thrown in at the backend did you used to treat your offensive line till a little Saturday night meal on the road absolutely I mean they loved it and they'd love to see how high they could run the bill up too and I didn't care if you don't do that for your current team you're not blocking all right Tracy let's give it out to you thanks Jim we saw a Patriots linebacker Dante Hightower go down on that last drive he was wincing in a lot of pain while athletic trainers were taking a look at him I was told it is a rib injury his return is questionable Jim okay thank you that last penalty as you heard was on hearty and it gives the Patriots a first down at the 29 and blood makes the little pitch and he scrambles out gets an additional yard or two this is some of the Patriots are so good about at the end of a tackle falling forward and somehow managing to squeeze out extra yardage here's something else they're really good at Rod Marinelli says it's the worst these outside crack back runs hard to see they have been so quick picked up big yardage and one still got four yards out of that Tuesday on CBS one pill makes him a crime solving mastermind catch the new hit from a limitless new episode Tuesday 10:00 9:00 central only CBS here you go look what they've done the Patriots came out spread the football out they were gonna throw the ball and be 10th man coverage uhoh the pass rush is better than we thought so what do they do let's switch up show him a little power running game his tom brady says we got more than just a driver in our golf bag we got the whole set second and six it's Luis and he's got three or four Cowboys around him including Tyrone Crawford and its hips is seen talking to Tom Brady in this offense they he says I don't really know what we're gonna do in the game we're just prepared for everything and we'll see how it goes along and we'll call plays accordingly so we've reached the end of the first quarter New England and Dallas three three you're watching the NFL on CBS home of Super Bowl 50 Jim Nantz bill Simms Tracy Wolfson 2nd quarter starting here with the Patriots near midfield what did you make out of the first quarter felt like I was doing the Super Bowl the intensity to speed the way they were playing it was really ferocious kind of fun to watch and Jim there's so much to talk about the Patriots we've never got into the fact that they placed so many different offensive linemen out there third and one they're 9 for 9 this year New England on third and one they go glug and blunt that streak comes to an end he has stacked up for no game this cowboy defense it's got the two things that everybody tries again I said it looked everybody at the line of scrimmage one person back they got the speed in the sides kitchens one of the first to get there but look at the penetration by the defensive lineman they're all up Rolando McClain in there great job they took away Tim what they took away the quarterback sneak one of the great plays that the pitchers love to use in certain situations pitches in church combining on that tackle the punt comes to beast that catches it on his shoulder pad and is able to get out to the 20 40 yard funny yard run back and a Cowboys offense coming back out they have a Texas State Fair going on the annual tradition that goes back to 1886 of course of their fair grounds yesterday Texas upset Oklahoma at the Cotton Bowl the old home of the Cowboys first and ten for Dallas and that's run by McFadden for three well there you go first down run once again but look at the number of people up near the line of scrimmage I said you know when you play the Cowboys and I've seen it I saw New Orleans do it last week just try to outnumber them first down guess that it's run attack the line of scrimmage making it tough people say there's Dallas offensive line is the best in the league do you agree with them well if it's not the best it's right up there the top two or three you can argue that but they gotta be a little more unpredictable on first down on second and seven week and time and then goes underneath to McFadden who's about a yard and a half short of the first this week The Late Show Stephen Colbert Oprah Winfrey will be a guest along with Jack flack and Jessica Chastain all view this week only CBS well the Jason Witten getting skits open here down the field he is going to work it's redundant but what's the biggest weapon right now in the passing game for the Dallas Cowboys I would say Jason Witten and called Beasley though please pick out a part of it too they're both getting all the attention third and warm and we in trouble and just has to throw it away over the head of Beasley by design now but the defender right there ninka bitch was chasing after the quarterback there's a reason why he convinced has been in his lineup for so many years right Jim here he comes outside he goes well I'm not gonna be one of those guys that chases the car down the road and be out of position he stays in position nowhere for Brandon Weeden to go with the football New England all over the bootleg and playaction passes so far the cowboy four drives for Dallas three of them have produced three announced the other of course the field goal and Emma Doble was out of bounds when he caught it good angle kick by Chris Jones they traveled 55 yards three three Rob Gronkowski on the season 510 yards running with the football in his hands that's had 300 in the r8 yards total taking a 510 to produce the 308 and he's gotten up to a top speed of nineteen point nine that's top speed among all tight ends this season have been measured he has not been targeted so far today though is at the bottom of the screen look at him now and he's got a catch right in front of Jones and what do you make of this matchup today here's the rookie out of UConn Byron Jones what an assignment to draw for him it is so far of what's I think every play he's been tight can stay on him and it looks like he's big enough he's 6 foot 205 but he looks much bigger in person he looks like he's about 63 long arms and not many people can go oneonone with Rob Gronkowski but Jones off to a good start and also you have Morris Claiborne with Julian Edelman he's matched up against him so far everywhere today they've moved Marcus cannon to left tackle and they run it right up the middle and that's Jones trying to stop him short but Lewis able to bounce off the tackle and pick up the first down on a gain of 6 I just mentioned cannon moves to the left side this Patriot offensive line they'll shift a lot of people around well you know we can't tell you all the shifts that because we did that's all you'd be talking about today they've shipped both guards already Marcus cannon plays right and left tackle even ensure yardage could play right guard but it just shows you the faith and how deep they are along the offensive line the balls knocked out still lose picked up by Edelman all the Cowboys had a play on it and again it was Hardy who was creating havoc in the backfield he got around Marcus cannon well you know it's almost it's not worth it but you could challenge this if you were the Dallas Cowboys and say it's an incomplete pass that T is harm what's going forward the football was in his hand and oh dad it was definitely it was the motion was going forward but it's not working for the couple yards statistically it goes as a sack there's Brady down the field and look who's open it's happening bang out they're going to get him with a pick Keshawn Martin number 82 doubleteam Greg Hardy that time and they still could barely keep him out of the backfield sleepwake went on the top there they go they're gonna watch what they do blatant pic that's a boy whitest pict he's playing the inside here's Tom Brady look how fast and here he's taking a beating back there with his offensive line of speed is getting beaten right now well why didn't we talk about I said when you take a guy like Greg Hardy just a little bit make the quarterback holder he's worried about him what it brings in good Marcus Lawrence Tyrone Crawford guys that have been very close to getting along sacks long second and 18 he steps away from the pressure on the edge and dumps it off underneath to Martin but Brady it's not every game that you see this much pressure on Tom Brady and much less get knocked down this many times for four quarters well look they've started a trend in the NFL when you talk about the Patriots the screens the quick passes get rid of it to make sure defensive lines cannot be a factor like we're seeing here right now the tight coverage the pressure defense is taken away some of the easy throws for Tom Brady given the odd the defensive line that extra beat to get to him it's there and 11 on him again and the Cowboys defense has yet another sack Jack Crawford think you don't listen here he comes from the outside and well they got these tackles Jim they got him on skates they're worried about the speed the crowd noise but when you do that you lose your power and you get pushed back we're not even to the halfway point of the second quarter and already Navis has deck Brady four times four sacks Whitehead with Slater who else as he has four years down there to pounce on the returner right away this one belonged to Jack Crawford during today's pregame the cowboy is recognized five star breast cancer survivors on the field with Charlotte Jones Anderson and Nancy Brinker the founder of Susan G Komen and Tony Romo was down there also mark the presentation together the NFL and the American Cancer Society encouraging everyone to join in the fight catch crucial catch day October 13th more details NFL comm give here to Randall squeezes out only a yard he's got now nine carries for 30 that's well it's tough big defensive front end in now and I like I told you early it's deep they can rotate guys in there on the defensive front keep them fresh but it's it's not about the big runs a set it DeMarco Murray could hit the pile and fall forward and right now it'd be second and six and instead of second and nine or eight this is by the way coming on the heels of Ryan Allen's 62 yard punt it's the second time he's pinned Dallas back at the 13 yard line second and nine to get it over to lucky Whitehead and his first NFL coat a catch goes for a loss of three he's the rookie out of Florida Atlantic let me say this Malcom Butler you remember that plane a Super Bowl of course that was pretty good stuff and he has not slowed down since he if if the Patriots can't recognize an outside receiver screen what defense could because they must see it a hundred times every week in practice all during training camp and they should be able to fend them well and that was a great job that time on the outside Cowboys third and 12 back at their 11 can anybody get open that's the big question here they rushed poor weight its it over to McFadden then McFadden er as a flag out he's right at the first down marker will Jack the flag and it might be a hold against the Cowboys holding left guard Ronald Leary there he is look at him gets beat who that's out there just we talked about being multiple there's Jamie Collins a linebacker and inside pass rusher on third down was when you look at him though Jim he looks like he should be a defensive lineman he does Commons in his third year out of Southern Mississippi they took him in the second round back in 2013 and he stepped up even back his rookie year he's a very active outside linebacker for this patriot defense and now is ready to jump on the Cowboys on third and 18 Wheaton when the end zone dumps it off to McFadden and he's able to get a little bit of space near the 18 tripped up by Brown might as well might be the best call a day by this Cowboys offense don't take a chance you're backed up you've got to understand who you're playing against it's gonna be hard to shut out the Patriots the whole game even though they've done a great job so far the Cowboys defense screen was safe helps field position for three and out for Dallas Cowboys so far 56 total yards in the game Chris Jones go up the middle and butt down at the 45 by Kyle Wilber after 46yard boots and let's take a look at our nationwide Skycam here at AT&amp;T Stadium between Dallas and Fort Worth and it's 33 again New England begins with good field position third time in this game that started at their own 45 or better quick throw and an immediate tackle on Amendola by Corey white but we'll check again another marker on the field illegal use of the hands hands to the base defense number 24 fiveyard penalty from the previous spot first down New England although Morris Claiborne Governor on the other side going against Julian Edelman and receivers like Jill and Ella but not you know he's not sixfoot to number 11 right there but the hand to the face but you win the battle with receivers like him slot receivers you would say by beating him up on the line of scrimmage and throwing him off the route from the gun on first down wide open he's got Edelman who's tackled from me back to the shoulder pads by Wilcox picks up 16 same thing formation tight coverage and they switch it up oh boy look at the feet so quick the shuffling of the feet caught Claiborne made him fall down first down for the Dallas 34 Dion Lewis and again he's able to sneak down that sideline for an extra couple of yards gain of seven tonight what does President Obama have to say about Vladimir Putin Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton find out on 60 minutes tonight only CBS well slow them down get a first down or to get them tired now you got a better chance to throw the football got a first down with that catch by Amendola these quick throws not giving the cowboy pass rush the chance to get all over brady that's what they're famous for you know it was their game plan the Super Bowl gets the Seattle Seahawks and they've worked it to perfection but the pass rushes to strength get rid of the football fast and first down from the Dallas 23 and that thrown in the area Dion Lewis and again Rainey hit the ground the party was the one who did it to him yet again well he's really having a party from it Tom Brady's left side is it we watch break RT get that hit we talked to Tyrone Crawford on Friday the Tyrone Crawford says look when you play the Patriots there's no double moves as a defensive lineman you make the move and you go because if you make the second move it's too late he'll throw the football Gronkowski at the top of the screen he has one catch for six yards in this game he's got Claiborne on him now not the rookie Jones to the other side of convergence but Lewis so quick and he's within a yard of the first well they switched up Jim because it was its own and all I can say is she plays own against the Patriots that's what's gonna happen and hurry to the line on third and one and the Cowboys get a hand on worse he breaks the catch within a yard of the end zone they had him for the loss on third and one and he slipped right past it how about it the quick feet able to just basically jump in the air change directions Tom Brady says it's unbelievable watching and just see how many people missing when they got him dead to right in the Cowboys not even set so there was a timeout call again the England like it did on that third and one run by Lewis they hurried to the line look at this Lewis gets in within a yard of the end zone 342 to go in the first half and the Patriots a yard away from the game's first touchdown first and goal inside the one party on the Cowboys sideline here for this snap what is the tail pack but Brady keeps and that's got to be a touchdown it is best in the business when it comes to a quarterback sneak well they read it they know when to do it and what's so important is how quick I said to you before the game it's like Tom Brady is moving forward as the ball is snapped and the sinners that they must practice it so much because the sinners far out and what a good job that time by Andrews and Jim said every time they give the situation if you line up in a defense that doesn't cover the sinner or pinch it on each side he's going to get that quarterback sneak on you 21st consecutive trip to the red zone regular and postseason where the Patriots had produced points Gaston ski adds the extra point and it's got to be a frustrating half for Tom Brady being sacked four times took out some of his frustrations after that touchdown his first rush touchdown in three years we could Tom Brady we saw how he spiked the football in the end zone let's go what he says he's doing a little yellow today I saw him a couple times going off the field I couldn't quite pick out who he's yelling at I just know it was one of the offensive linemen so high expectations of courts they usually meet him to his down ski that kickoff there was seven yards into the end zone where Whitehead wants to run with it and again for the terrible dissent in the Cowboys not a good one at all third times will start a drive at the 13 yeah it was high it was deep in the endzone don't do it let's go to Tracy thanks Jim you mentioned earlier this is the first time the Patriots late here at Cowboys Stadium and I had a chance to speak with Tom Brady about he said it's weird for him playing in the lead for 16 years to experience a new stadium so he came out onto the field a little earlier checked out the clocks checked out the big scoreboard just tried to get a little acclimated to the situation and Bill Belichick telling us reminded his team all week about the distractions the stadium breaks he said expect a circus out there it seemed like they were stunned early but a huge touchdown there Jim now the Cowboys now will try to respond we'll call it from the 14 thanks Tracy Wheaton just a little dump off here to McFadden eyes to activate the stiff arm on Justin Coleman well what you do I like that that was different getting the shotgun first down it caught the defense may be a little by surprise so they give you an easy completion you know the Patriots like any team if you make them keep rushing the quarterback they're gonna get tired and maybe that's a way they can get some of these receivers open I mean so far go Beasley so we we've seen him shake a defender but really nobody else it's a handoff to McFadden then again the Cowboys will face a third and about four well you look at the cowboy wide receivers Beasley has two catches for 12 yards Whitehead has one catch for a loss of three and Witten has not been targeted so far so the wide outs have three catches for nine yards and this is what you have without Dez Bryant and that's exactly right they're just so reliant on one guy to help you it's like it's like Greg Hardy there's Dez Bryant aside on what he does for defensive lineman Dez Bryant does the exact same thing for wide receivers he helps him get open because he draws double coverage third and five Wheaton is almost intercepted right in the hands of Chandler Jones who dropped back in the coverage Chandler Jones 95 here he is turns reads the quarterback and Brandon Weeden he'd lost all we see in front of the receiver but sometimes you just go I want to make a throw you quit you get tired of dumping it short he took a chance and lucky to get away with it five of the six cowboy possessions have failed to produce a first down so Chris Jones for the fifth time short punt this time and New England with a flag out returns it to the Cowboys out of the field Brandon Bolden was in so fast on the punter he influenced that short punt Andrew GATS car on the tackle starting field position it is a big difference 16 yard line for the Cowboys doing in their own 34 during the return holding return team number 26 10yard penalty spot of the foul first challenge so that's a call on Logan Ryan will put the football back on the New England side but two minutes to go in the first half Brady and the Patriots also have all of their timeouts leading 10 three coming out of the twominute warning in Dallas and the Patriots leading it 10 3 they had three timeouts just drove it down for the game's only touchdown Brady scoring from a yard out big drive for this cowboy defense down seven keep the team in the game lady steps up and slides for a gain of one the Verizon halftime report is on the way there are actually three overtime games in the early window today we'll have all the stories from the early action JB and the crew also preview Thursday Night Football on CBS and NFL Network the Atlanta New Orleans game coming up in four days time second and eight when they blitz and Grady was able to get rid of it Paul looked like it might have been tipped oh it was tipped caught me by surprise here comes all feet off the edge you think in all its going to be its own the way they lined up and they caught the bump sure Tom Brady thought the same thing for a white Corey White playing the Nickelback this week taking over for Tyler Patman they liked the fact just the speed is sighs so far he's played pretty well out in the slot the number one third down offense in the league is only one for five today on third down third and eight Brady's pass incomplete off the fingertips at Gronkowski who's had a quiet first half quiet first half really good job of the Cowboys defense one are a couple reasons the pressure on the quarterback but how about that excellent I mean excellent coverage by Byron Jones and he's down on the field right now we've got a cowboy defender down and it is the rookie Byron Jones well if the cowboy offense can get in sync like that group of fans maybe put up some points before the half and there's a whole lot of shaking going on her wrist by the way the Cowboys charged to timeout the trends of the need for Jones to get off the field he was fine it appears Cowboys start in the better spot than their own 20 that's the best they've had so far nope gonna be back at the 13 again well let's talk about this cowboy offense not running the football real well but you tell me where you want Brandon weed to throw a doubleteam on Jason Witten nobody open as you go across the field and how about this listen to play did I've seen a lot of doubleteam at the bottom of the screen and just lock down everybody shadowed by a New England defender you don't know England all this is gonna change their team they lost some of their defensive backs and Darrelle Revis is gone they're playing as much mantoman coverage now as he did last year with Darrelle Revis out there helping them out the timeout means the Cowboys have only one and remember from the New England sign if they can make a quick stop they still have all other timeouts Cowboys need to find a way to get a first down and that's a drop the Easley usually so reliable and the clocks have 106 again the Verizon halftime report is coming up back in the studio in New York there's Tony in coach Cowher Parton boomer and Jane be ready to preside on the horizon halftime report I was gonna wear that coat that Bart has on the day and I said you know I'll wait Thursday night Thursday night I'll do that New Orleans Cowboys have not picked up a first down in 18 minutes of action second and ten Whitten hits the ground back at the five it's shared with the let Akal yep left guard that time Leary just got pushed back and ran over timeout New England outbound jabal Shearer what an addition he's been for this Patriot team one of the big sneaky free agent pickups up the offseason I think an all boy he got Leary just backpedaling and what you get in that position as an offensive lineman I know it's rough that's a tough spot but of course the other one disguise that you we didn't pay it you don't pay attention to Dion Lewis being picked up and they both have one thing in common they both Larry Cleveland the New England had their eye on 13 18 Cowboys go draw out to the 11 the other thing they actually have more than one thing in common they both had caught the eye back in Cleveland of their former general manager Michael Lombardi who is now with the Patriots as a personnel man and he's responsible for them both being in New England and he really been Dion Lewis speaks for self everybody can kind of see that his runs his catches and all that stuff but sheered I loved him at Cleveland so you know always players got to move because it's usually about money and he fits what New England's looking for a player that can do multiple things play the edge play inside on pass rush which we just saw and really just played well every game and that was a huge series Jim by the Cowboys offense not getting one first down they have only three first downs for the half and they all came on the one field goal drive other than that nothing don't advise to angle this to the sideline again now let's see where how far forward they go 45 yard line it's been really pretty much the whole first half has been like this New England right around its own 4045 the other end the Cowboys back inside our own 20 about this the Blitz up in it up inside mcclain the Greg Hardy Greg Hardy Jack Crawford Jack Crawford that time but the pressure you haven't seen this kind of pressure of course on Tom Brady all year we did see that one good Drive when they could spread them out and do all the things they'd love to do the Cowboys if you give a little tiredness drive do not be afraid to use that last timeout the slogan softens that party is not out on that defensive line to start this series but someone else is on Brady this time and they've got a sack with Tyrone Crawford there's the guy that really could step up and get some good numbers because of the pressure that Greg Hardy can't create Tyrone Crawford he's been about one foot away from about eight sacks this year how about five sacks by Dallas in this first half and the clock running as Brady again under attack steps out of it and is able to get a tatelman who's getting him in field goal maybe not quite has got to be close at the 13cent mark he's at the 39 and Edelman breaking exact hole who knows from here would be about 57 yards from Kozlowski but they have a chance to run another play well look that's all Tom Brady there no question said to him last night you know you're moving around more than I've seen you move and he goes yep I'm watching the other quarterbacks in the league I'm studying them they're moving so he has been moving of course he moves to throw the football saw it against Jacksonville up seen it every game and ulemas a big play there and Hammond Ola and Brady they spent a lot of time in the offseason training together Brady even took him up to Montana and at 9,000 feet they went through their own and kind of boot camp if you will sorry to get 6:00 in the morning working out pulling the football around with his two receivers amazing isn't that hard work it pays off and every time the Dallas Cowboys have not played pressure defense the Patriots have made a sizable gain against the zone and hold on timeout first called by Dallas and put the path back at 14 pretty much if you tackled the Patriots in the field of play it's doubtful they could get the field goal unit out there to try a kick before the intermission and New England is out of timeouts that's you know we sold the same situation at the end of the half in Houston and of course the Texans on that occasion Thursday night hit for the Hail Mary touchdown only thing I'm going to say New England's a little different they do so many things in practice situations if he throws a short run over the middle it would be close I wouldn't want to try it but they might be able to get up there quick enough spike line up and spike rady meet two scornful ollanta its Matthew Slater and it's incomplete with eight seconds remaining Slater so seldom used on offense but when they bring him out it's usually the fly patterns that's right because he's fast and he's the Steve Tasker of our time would be the best special teams player and in this generation just exactly fantastic and well let's say our kosowski attempt here is going to be from 57 yards he was hitting the back of the net from this distance in warmups I know it's game different footballs but this distance should not be a problem it would be a careerlong if he makes it this now skis kick hit the net who said it needed another three or four yards to be in field goal range well the line did no it doesn't look like it could have gone another six or seven yards out Jim you know watch them in warmups always watch the kickers and they just you just go I don't know what they're gonna do to you want to change the footballs that they kick in these field goals because pretty soon we're gonna indoors especially they make it look so easy and Tom Brady knows three points in this game is a big deal how about Tom Brady has never been sacked five times in a half in his career and he still leads by 10 with half time just three seconds away well we're talking so much about that side of the ball the Patriots offense Cowboys defense two sacks early what's the story of the game the Cowboys their offense nobody can get open and the Patriots defense is manhandling the running game so if Stephen gast\u00e3o skia his do the tenth year picker out of Memphis who has led the NFL in scoring the last three years and leads again this season he's just kicked this career long field goal and tied the New England alltime record long a 57 that belonged to Adam Vinatieri now they share it amazing how much room he had to spare just not surprised I'm surprised more I know okay yes they always can kick it farther than we think right and who are we to say that they can't make it from way out there I get bored watching the team's warmup so i watch the kickers a lot so that's it so cowboys take a knee they've gotta sort some things out for sure offensively as they generated only 60 yards of offense and three first downs it gonna halftime I'll just say of real quick they've got to give their team that got to be more deceptive formations movement make the Patriots back off a little and guess it watch you got what you're going to do instead of just line it up and make it a fight alright let's go down to Tracy thanks a lot I'm here with Jason Garrett and coach tremendous job by your defense there but how do you get something going offensively to keep them off the field we just got to keep battling we got to keep battling throughout our football team the defense has done a nice job pressuring the quarterback we've got to slow them down can't get let those receivers get free offensively we just got to be good on first and second down and convert some of these thirds keep mixing the running pass any chance we could see Matt Cassel at all no we're gonna keep banging away we're just gonna get it done for us Thank You Tracy good question there they're gonna stay with Wheaton who is 7 out of 13 for 36 yards in that first half only one touchdown that was Brady on a oneyard sneak to kosowski field goals including a careerlong 57 yards and the verizon anthem reports coming up Cowboys are gonna be kicking here momentarily to the Patriots and now it's time for who are you loved and presented by McDonald's Brady right behind his rookie center David Andrews a yard out the game's only touchdown until what are you looking for here in the third quarter oh my gosh well let's see the Cowboys had 11 first downs eight runs three passes you got to get this defense you know guessing and you got to open it up a little you got to make it easier find ways for Brandon Weeden to get some easy plays we I think we Chronicle it well in the first half nobody getting open you got to deal with movement and formations and supplies to the point Martin wolf take a knee so how do you think Brady comes out of that first they got the lead but you've never seen him hit like that and they have first time in his career sacked five times and a half well I think he reacted very well to it during the half he was composed but he had a chance he still made the throws and you know he didn't panic under the pressure of the pass lesson just throw a football when he didn't see something cleanly look at the first half numbers 12 first downs for New England again only three by Dallas all coming on one drive the drive that produced the 51yard field goal by Bailey right go line offense first play and blunt the big pack with a flag out is stacked up by Claiborne and Crawford and Shawn Lee holding often number 11 called on Evelyn let's go down to Tracy thanks a lot I had a chance to speak with Bill Belichick coming out of half as for the five sacks he said his guys just need to get open quicker one of those guys live from Kowski just one catch in the first half an update on Dante Hightower he had a rib injury he has been downgraded to happy so Hightower will not return for this Patriots defense meanwhile the Patriot offense first in twenty rady pass there is Gronkowski shopping aside at the fender and stiffarming Wilcox as well Iron Jones all Overeem up on the top side of the field by themselves and that was nothing Jones can do that was not offensive pass interference that was a perfect roll by Tom Brady back shoulder and the big drunk made the adjustment look what drunk did though more importantly after the catch he he can rumble he just cost Byron Jones aside like he wasn't even there and then almost was able to stiff arm and get away from Wilcox his guys that have played against one cows get said to me oh my gosh he's so much bigger faster and athletic in person that's a gain of 33 very bad ones good for three yards you know I don't want to overstate that one completion but it's like like a gamechanger here they kind of backed up first and 20 here we go you're covering everybody pretty well perfect coverage by Byron Jones field position changes and it just changes the whole atmosphere of the stadium he's got to be deflating for the cowboy defense also you know what it was it was the longest play of the game to this point 33 yards setting him up now I'll pass the 40 here's a second at 7 toss over to Dion Lewis look at that giggle and I'm number one and a murse now boy can he take out a defender with the best of Sean Lee brings him down but it's a first down yep and you know you said it they got away from Sean Lee I should say Atrix had their eye on Dion Lewis they love throw on the football to him they like handing it to him in the run game too and what a Dion Lewis say I feel so fortunate because of politics eagle of front office people not drafted this money might get he got another chance in the Patriots are a team that gives unique players like him until that was 46 it's got six more down to the 40 you know what I mean the interest oh no question it's such an interesting dynamic what they have now at running back you got the big bruising back like blunt who we've seen in New England most magnificent numbers in some games and then you got the short shifting running back idea on Lewis what a onetwo punch that is the one again is able to get back near the line of scrimmage as the Marcus Lorenz had him first no gain this comes to my point as you watch the penetration the tackle on LeGarrette Blount Bill Belichick give him a lot of credit he saw the rule changes in the NFL and how things were going to change in the game of football so he made his offense much more diverse got players that can do multiple things make it harder for you to figure out what they're gonna do on the offensive side and he was ahead of the curve the hurryup offense to spread offense with Randy Moss back in 207 and got a good quarterback to course running this often he's got Gronk oneonone at the bottom of the screen heard a father Kowski get separation from jones and takes him with them to the 23 so grunt Kowski now starting to get in the flow of things his second catch on this drive this one 418 goes underneath and it's just a little diversion the inside receiver comes out it makes Jones like okay I don't want to get picked he gives ground then it's too late 51 yards on the two catches on this series for Gronkowski after only one catch for six yards in the first half he's back to block and he's inside the redzone where as we mentioned last time once they get to this point New England has scored the last 21 trips inside the red zone well cowboy defense another tough spot form Rod Marinelli defensive coordinator they got to keep the aggressiveness there and going against this offense and the other thing is tired as a flag just thrown into the back of the pile and a holding signal they're gonna say this is a going to be a call against Dallas it appears remember the second half began with a touch back and then a holding call had New England back to the ten to the face defense number 55 so instead of it being third and two its first down now for New England at the 10yard line four players come off for the New England Patriots four more substitutions come in pretty funny and the four that came in or awesome all the running back three receivers miss Brady still winning Lewis for the touchdown sensational effort a onehanded catch and then he ducks underneath the Dallas defender and finds that endzone he might be short but he is strong recovers with the kids look at that goes underneath you know there is something to it when you're a short running back this happens a lot players that was Jack Crawford just ran right over the top of him I've seen him do this a few times already this year and we met him last night and you could tell Jim when you meet him he is like they say he might not be tall but he is strong looking his mouse key adds the extra point he went to the University of Pittsburgh right behind with sean mccoy and ended up being in philadelphia is a backup gives McCoy a lot of credit for teaching him how to make it in the NFL and he's making it big in New England touchdown Patriots Robert Kraft the chairman of the Patriots Danny craft along side and just witnessing now Tom Brady and his 400 and second career touchdown pass back into a tie with Drew Brees report all time and the Cowboys first possession of the second half will begin at the 20 it'll feel like that's midfield some of the art here at AT&amp;T Stadium the Cowboys now try to get a little creative offensively after producing only 59 yards in the first half random Costas pudding for a moment but regains footing for five that's what it looked like their first half chart in it was rough it was rough and you you said the word Nakata you know I really thought they were going to do more with Brandon Weeden today instead of trying to be the team that they were last year let's run it and dominate the clock look at this defensive front for New England I'm a long way away they look big from this far away slippers over here they run again with Randall able to keep his balance get within a yard of the first wake up and watch with the world for the first time ever the NFL was streaming a live game on Yahoo bills Jaguars from London Sunday morning October 25th 9:30 Eastern and learn more at yahoo.com slash NFL scream so the Cowboys have three first downs all day New England just managed five on its last possession and they've brought in Christian Michael they picked up from Seattle on wasn't it outside and pick up the first I think I'm anxious to seem here now you know what I say this doing the defensive front what a read takes it off tackle here seize it fast low to the ground kind of runner and strong got you know got him from Seattle now this doing on defense when I save their front now I know they have not been good at stopping a run so far this year but they are building it they're getting some guys back to big this defensive linemen they're deep and they got big linebackers to first purse down in 25 minutes throwing now on first and ten and then complete look at the coverage by Malcolm Butler on Terrence Williams who has been held without a catch Williams who caught the tying touchdown against New Orleans on Sunday night look at this I mean it's just all over him and he's been like that all day long so it's almost like in happen in this game and you know Terrence Williams I understand Dez Bryant's out out there but it's like Kevin Darrelle Revis they're taking extra guys and putting it on Jason Witten and then where's Brandon Weeden supposed to go with the football yeah no catches Williams no catches wit Witten and it's second and ten away going to take a couple of players with him maybe get another half a yard out of it you know I saw Kristen Michael come in there and run the ball I thought that looked pretty good maybe we'll give him another chance but you know usually when a running back comes in the game I'm sure they're worried about past protections and some of the other things that he hasn't been around here long enough to maybe accomplish and get ready for receivers brought in to this third down snap Devon Street lucky right head pick up there's a flag out right in the hands of Street illegal contact defense number 32 fiveyard penalty automatic first down soma Cordys infraction keeps the cowboys drive going I thought they meant maybe 22 on the outside that is I didn't see really that much contact by 22 or 32 but how about Justin Coleman a rookie going out there and I'm watching all the games they've played this year before today's game going man how do guys come in the lead undrafted play for the Super Bowl champions and find a way to get on the field and cover the third receiver he's a rookie out of Tennessee as Coleman the DB for the Patriots Saturday the SEC on CBS brings out the best game from the best conference Nick Saban's Alabama Crimson Tide going against Kyle Allen and the Aggies Alabama A&amp;M it all begins with college football today so Whedon with three straight incompletions that's the first time that's happened now this season this his third start of the year back on the completion train and he's got Winton for the first time today and a first down he picks up 16 what's dried Mayo in the middle they got two guys crossing and whatever he does is going to be wrong but the big thing is a couple things protection and you notice the New England defense backed off a little and ran and we even found the open guy 960 bit catch of Whitman's career Hall of Fame career you got a 10 years Rambow reaches out found a yard shy of the percents Mayo holds on to him really got some rhythm you know it only takes a couple first downs to change the mindset of the players the feeling on the field and more importantly Jim the guy calling the plays we talked about the rhythm of players all the time play collars especially offensive coordinators they need some rhythm too Scott Linehan well okay you got some things set up but protect it a little better now you can maybe draw a few plays up from that place sheets you have no chance to run where they marked it they gave them the first down so from the 38 Cowboys drive over four minutes long and short side and nothing there except Shearer who had a big first half including a sack that helped lead to a field goal right before the intermission a big season just you know you don't even ask when we met with Bill Belichick last night even asking like who's could have starters game play if you don't play with the Patriots in the game you're in trouble because they like to use they use everybody on both sides of the ball the rotation is almost impossible to keep up with they've got to figure it out on that sideline second and nine the FOP to grin forty's they're Collins's there and a loss of two or three this jason McCourty well in Collins Collins is like the newage linebacker watch ninety one here in the middle sees the run reads the quarterback and he's just so big long arms and can be all over it was there anybody open no double coverage on who did you see the double coverage on Jason Witten saw that minivan he was open Lindy Escobar had a step or two but not much there third and 12 couple yards to get in field goal range it is complete Devon Street second catch of the year and a Cowboys have a first down catch of the day for the Cowboys lays out gets his hands underneath it toes on the ground did that fall though was it all the way to the ground I think it is the ball is allowed to hit the ground yes he has possession that is a completion not going to be challenged go back to Randall and he ripped off a good run and a good nigger miles ahead for another four or five and that's Joseph Randle's best run of the game well now this looks like the Cowboys and you know even I'm sitting here this is what they were hoping to do from the beginning control the clock a little make their running game really get active and the best thing they're doing they're running right at New England not going sideways going straight ahead seems to be working a lot better than anything they tried in the first half they have more yardage on this Drive than that did the entire first half this their first possession of the second half down by Randall that's another good effort by the third year back out of Oklahoma State give him five he's got 61 on 15 attempts one possession by the Patriots to start the quarter which led to a touchdown and now this drive that's taken up nearly seven and a half minutes the Dallas dublin bc and Jason Whitney McFadden he is written down by Allen branch and the Cowboys will face a third down snap from the seventh and will need poor for the first Patriot player is down and that is Doron Harman third and four at the New England seven they're down three scores so unless they get I would think inches away from a first you gotta at least get a feel go out of this Drive till I I agree to him to me unless it's inside of one yard and you feel confident you kicked the field goal and you continue this game and keep it to try to get it to to score here's Witten in motion through the other tight end though is written in fact written but he's only able to pick up two it's just it's smart look what they did they tried to give Whitney some room make the defense back up they won't walk Avery will because they knew the yardage once before t32 goes around he knows he doesn't have to over pursue and puts it in a tough position and makes the another good tackle on the side makes him kick a field goal heard a few boos as they bring out damn Bailey but you got to come out of this down 17 you got to bring it within two scores absolutely no brainer Jason Garrett rain amount kit from 23 is good a long drive for Dallas it lasted eight minutes and 31 seconds but it only produces three demands phil simms Tracy Wolfson the cowboy season that began with so much promise and optimism opening wind they had against the New York Giants then the win on the road Philadelphia so they got a road win in the division or two and OH two division wins now would team down in danger of a third straight loss all of this of course coming apart with the loss first of Dez Bryant and then their leader Tony Romo Patriots will come out of the 20 here late third quarter here's a look at our nationwide Skycam with a minute and change to go in the third quarter Patriots lead at 22 six Tom Brady with a touchdown run from the yard out and a touchdown pass to Dion Lewis here he goes back the Lois Church is on them for five you look at the Patriots are coming out of there by week they get the early by which most teams would rather have it or in the mid season but going into that by they put up 51 and a win against Jacksonville scored on their first nine possessions of that game this offense really never goes into a protective mode they're always pushing it and there's a tackle on plunk to the yards shy of a first and on the season the Patriots have only trailed 43.3% of the time on the clock well what the Dallas Cowboys need they need a big defensive stop they need to make a play on the defensive side Greg Hardy been rusting he's back in the game can he fire this defense up to maybe give him a chance to get back in this game you got to admit for god\u00b4s been out all that we talked about his presence on the field was great in the first half and his plate was outstanding especially in the first quarter yes so they've just announced that that is going to be the end of the third quarter 22:6 as we head to the fourth back after this message and a word from your local station and let's take a look at next gen stats presented by assuring today Edelman Creek area three receptions and staple break tackles get 61 yards total Gronk key on that first drive of the second half 51 yards on two catches on that drive alone third and 2 big play to start the fourth quarter up 14 New England Brady there's no second option what a catch reaching out and making the Grandpa's Keshawn Martin who they picked up in a trade from Houston really tremendous job look what the peach which do they did on both sides they stack receivers they make you back off but here's what makes the play Tom Brady the movement in the pocket really just he his decline in ability is zero his arm is as good as I've ever seen it his foot movement is still outstanding I think he saw on the football great so far this year and he steps back he's looking down the field and he finds wide open there's a flag out you think Julian Edelman laying down the middle of the field ran into a defender probably Claiborne who was covering Edelman but you see what I mean the difference when you watch the Patriots how they always Dion Lewis is getting to pick on one side they stack the receivers so it always puts the defensive player you know it makes them back up and just gives the offensive player just a greater chance of getting open they're just not going to stay in there stationary and let you beat them up in this offense Motors along and it's not like they have one of these receivers that people consider to be you know of just an absolute beast on the outside now they've created their own little offense you solve IT rattle been going across that's a good call you think all the way he look you got to avoid the defensive players you can but they have done something different they've taking smaller receivers he created a role for him in this league and they playing inside a lot and they just don't split them out there and say hey your dad's Bryan Callen Johnson beat somebody oneonone and we'll pull it to the sideline and they got one on one down here for Gronkowski with flavor like this one swings away from the tackle yards have to catch that's been we got to let them catch it and tackle them it's a great thought but they are the best at getting extra yards after the catch Dion Lewis we've seen it with Edelman and medulla and of course Ron crunch Rob Gronkowski he does a little different way his yards after the catch with this because he can carry people with him and shove people to the side as we saw on that one catch in that third quarter Grady's hit his last seven passes he's got second at 13 and he's got an open Adelman two tackles is home for the touchdown Tom Brady took a big hit but once again the deceptive offense what they did he was inside comes outside in the cowboy defense doesn't react boy was Brady hit by Hardy who never saw it Edelman look at this oh let's let's get another pick on the inside and Edelman I don't know how tall he is let's say 510 but he is made of steel he is tough we saw it we see it all the time saw it in the Super Bowl a tremendous with the football on his hands pallemans third catch of the game that went for at least 20 this one goes for 59 and a touchdown the Patriots go up 21 Edelman the former Kent State quarterback who didn't even think about being a receiver until he played his last college game and somebody said you can make it in the NFL in another position we're back and you're looking at Jason Witten the acknowledged he grew up wanting one day be on a cereal box in that which has come true how about that Witten's lucky stars at local Albertsons stores what my cereal would be eat it so you won't feel good what a play by the Patriots again another play a different look by the way Brady and this half has not missed he's eight for eight including two touchdowns and oh yeah these two guys grew up about eight miles apart in the South Bay the San Francisco area Redwood City and San Mateo we talked last night to Julian Edelman all he wanted to do in college was try to take his team to a bowl game didn't even think about playing professionally and then it looked like he might go to Canada was offered to go to Canada that redish Colombia line said come up here and be a quarterback and then he had his agent and I'm sure he's very thankful this said no try this NFL thing you know I think you can do it and in another position he wasn't even sure what that position was gonna be big baton the flag out and he picks up five but Edelman ended up just working out as a receiver just hoping to get noticed by somebody with former NFL quarterback Charlie fry that's right Kent State and they were close together and unless this in case this football thing didn't work out he's also taking some exams to perhaps pursue a career as a firefighter down in Cincinnati so he was keeping that in play all the sudden he gets drafted in the seventh round by New England and he wanted to talk about people want to automatically assume he learned everything from Wes Welker he wants to correct you on that yes it's Randy Moss it's Deion Branch you know it's you know Jabar Gaffney Donte Stallworth the people he's been around he said I've learned a little bit corrected me that is well said and that's what you do when you're that type of player you you gather information from a lot of people try to make it work for you your weekend will start here when the Falcons undefeated take on the Saints on Thursday Night Football on CBS and NFL Network they win today and overtime and Lana does and they've actually trailed in the fourth quarter of four of their five games but they've won them all now and there's a nice pass and Williams has his first catch of the game good for 17 the exact distance he covered for a touchdown against the Saints beautiful throw and catch Williams got a little separate separation at time from Malcolm Butler and Brandon Weeden right on target and it's McFadden up ahead for three but you know real quick just going back to the Patriots they catch the football the yards after the catch it's not always the big ones it's always those three and four that they seem to die for and then the again we started it it took a while but they wear you down with the number of different looks and we saw one for the touchdown it'll be second and seven and looking as lost the football was it ever a clean catch I'm not sure that's going to hold up as a catch but on the field it looks like they're gonna call it a fumble recovery by three knee and New England have to take another look at that is all turnovers already viewed anyway Collins who reached in well slow motion it looks like he has it for enough time but if you see it and regular speed was it a catch in football it's gonna be close scooped up by Jonathon Freeney you will say cleat blakeman's coming out as a catch and a fumble or is it incompletion Mike Kerry in New York did you see it the same way I saw it the same way maybe even got a little stronger for catch fumble because he had control the ball switched it to his left hand then the ball came loose I think all those points for a catch were met very good Mike good to see you see you Thursday night in Atlanta Adrian's take over in New Orleans start at the 36 and there is a quick tackle by a McClane we've got an update let's go back to New York that opportunistic Denver D you're right JV Raiders down nine to seven driving on the Broncos approaching field goal range here you go Chris Harris jr. steps in front of a dirt car passed 75 yard interception returned for touchdown Broncos take a 167 lead Jim Phil and Tracy all right guys you don't mess with Chris Harris jr. we had the longest interception return in Bronco history a few years ago on the road at Baltimore that one went 97 this one today 75 to best units in football Patriots offense Denver's defense second and 11 years of bass and it's almost intercepted that was Corey white bori white we haven't seen too much of this today how about that he read it right away saw the faith and shot right through there boy right white we told you earlier give the Chi the first start that's an extra defensive back and his head of solid eight Brady's first in completion of the second half he's got third and 11 now scheme Wow you seen that kind of effort here in Texas a lot but it's usually over the rodeo with a football that's what it must feel like to these poor guys I got my gosh this is there's nothing liking in the league you know there's no tight in block it's physical the size it's so limber and it you know it's right out there could have it he doesn't have it though they're gonna go for Jim more than a foot well you're up three scores if you kick it that makes it four scores what would you call it trying to bring down Gronkowski steer wrestling's on micro free end up bull riding or yes dear wrestling the hosts see yeah before Gronkowski came along and they're the toughest eight seconds and squirt is that used to call bull riding you know you have all the line to the rodeo but I think it to go I think of all as the drunk is fourth down cowboy defense denies LeGarrette Blount boy good job right up inside they were ready for the inside run and they took care of it keeps the Cowboys what hopes they have still alive you surprised that didn't go field go there I thought they would go for it this is the way they play football they're aggressive in their decisionmaking that time it backfired you see Tony Romo and Jason Garrett their defense has just come up with the stop on fourth and one which plans diving ahead 4:13 you talked to Jason Garrett he does say that Tony Romo gives him some ideas from time or two on the sidelines yeah I would think so and probably gives him more sometimes he wants to hear but Tony were almost so much experience such a great player knows the game and you know as a quarterback you standing over the sidelines you can see things pretty clearly Wheaton has completed his last nine and they didn't have a chance to throw at this time second sack of the afternoon huija ball sheared well they're gonna block number 91 but look how late the game comes in other words it just the disguise and the patience in this you know when you're talking about doing those kind of games it's about timing and spacing and that time they did it perfectly the ball sheared is Jamie Collins Devin McCourty we all believe in people out but they've all been outstanding here today three sacks by New England by shear and that's Beasley trying to fake out McCourty we moved laterally with him holds him six you know let me say this we're talking a lot about New England they're up twenty seven to six so rightly so but to think about this team and I'm convinced this is not the it's going to get better this team is going to get better as this year goes along and not nearly enough for the first two Whitney well people are already starting to talk about comparisons with this Patriot team they're gonna go for here on fourth that yes I think they would you they have to here you want to win the game you're near me at field fort down three scores you must go for it comparisons being made to the O seven New England team well no it's early yeah just a really good start to the season if they can hang on here today waiting they slip out of it and he's gonna pick up the first by running for it I think if he Brandon Weeden I think today if they could have just blocked a little better and got a better flow we would have seen more this being spontaneous you know running with the football moving to throw but those opportunities have not been there for first down now for waiting mangle only one let me just answer this question still got a lot of time 6:52 timeouts twominute warning Brandon Weeden is going to be the quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys next week I know that'll be a big story Oh Matt Cassell they're going to go to him no they're not it's gonna be Brandon Weeden next week as the starting quarterback of this football team Matt Cassel of course the former Patriot game the Dow is just a couple of weeks ago by way of Buffalo it's Logan Ryan with the interception written ins the return well that was good timing on my comment but it's still not going to change anything bad decision trying to make a play tough to do against a good defense fans of all ages snapping up the pink gear during the month of October there at the Dallas Cowboys Pro Shop in this breast cancer awareness programs taking place throughout the month around the lien so the Cowboys turn it over twice in this quarter by fumble and now by interception look at him look at him going down the sideline near the 20 yard line that was Shaq Mason the rookie from Georgia Tech who was leading the brigade 69 that's what he does best he plays left guard when he does he is an excellent puller what a surprise playing for Georgia Tech and that great one offense they have down there but that when he comes in there always be alert runs to the right he can ball and lead and excellent at it and I'll say this to the Cowboys don't sit there and think don't think New England's just gonna sit here and they're gonna keep coming they play 60 minutes your job to stop them they're not gonna stop themselves by kneeling on the ball Oh his front running behind Sebastian Homer they're going without Nate soldier the second half because he's out with an elbow injury Jim let me give you a teaching moment for young quarterbacks when you're out there playing here's the receiver at the bottom of the screen what's Jason Whitney inside they're open you're down three scores just methodically try go down the field instead of trying to make a great throw and about trying to make that great throw all you do is throw what looks a little gasoline on the fire about your position and what you are and where you are in the football team on the brazing second and seven and there's a toss back to the line of scrimmage week five continues Sunday Night Football 49ers at the Giants on NBC this evening tomorrow Monday Night Football Steelers at the Chargers yes PN and of course Thursday Night Football undefeated Atlanta against New Orleans will have that game for you on CBS and NFL Network you were talking about math castle there he is he just moved his young family's got another child on the way in the next couple of weeks right and he led this Patriot team through the bulk of that season back in 2008 when Brady was injured in the first game went ten and five as a starter they lost out on tiebreakers to get into the playoffs but he played well then of course Kansas City had a Pro Bowl season the whole season to playoff he's very capable but you know he was just named the backup quarterback this week that's right moved up from 3 to 2 I have a clue tell them more he's still learning everything down here so he got ready to come in I don't think good start for this team third and seven Brady calls the timeout by the way we've got another doubleheader weekend coming up on Sunday early many will see Denver at Cleveland the Browns returned home after a heartbreak at San Diego and a thrilling wind today in overtime against Baltimore so they'll be hosting Peyton Manning and the Broncos who were winning out in Oakland at the moment and then late we're gonna be in Green Bay for that game San Diego and the Packers to most of the nation all starting with the NFL today at noon Eastern Time next Sunday on CBS now last Sunday talking about Tom Brady I said what did you do during your bye week he attended the wedding of his sister Nancy a Sunday night wedding in Boston and we send our congratulations to Nancy and Steve Benelli a wonderful occasion an element was a little twitchy in the slot back I'm up five ball start offense number eleven fiveyard penalty so they're down you know I was going down the path before that interception about how they Patriots have gotten off to this start that has sparked a lot of chatter about well who's going to beat this and you never know and I can throw out all the disclaimers in the world as they go down to about 15 you start looking around the landscape got an undefeated Cincinnati team hats off to them you know they've got Indianapolis coming up on the road they for some reason they've had you know for a number of reasons they've had the better of Indianapolis and all these meetings in recent years and well it's some tough matchups therefore the you necklace coach you look at the Jets their defense it's gonna take an extraordinary you know it's going to take a defense that can slow this offense down and the Cowboys five sacks in the first half who's gonna do a better job than that but it just doesn't deter this offense it's so many years a Bill Belichick and Tom Brady being together and they just keep adding ideas on to what they have and we heard it from the Cowboys the whole day on Friday Wow a lot to get ready for and they just do the their best way to win the game dominate the run game by their offense and they had to constantly pressure Tommy here's Gaston skiout 34yard mere chip shots after the neck thing on that 57 yarder career long in the first half Patriots this year have a 70 point differential over their opponents up 24 here some of the early headlines around the league want to come back by the Bengals staying undefeated and the Seahawks lose for the third time this year and Matt Ryan and the Falcons win in overtime over the Redskins on a pick six return to end it and the Packers shut down the Rams to stay undefeated you look at that would eat but stands out to you film shoot Devonta Freeman the fact that Atlanta is running the football so well therefore no listen the Cincinnati Bengals we know they got some guys back from injury their talent they got guys at every level on both sides of the football that can make plays for the land of being five and all can't wait to watch them Thursday night we'll look on the AFC side and you've got different not to close out that game you got Cincinnati and you got New England they're all gonna be undefeated at the end of this week three of them yep from one conference yep some good football teams some good units right now if you said to me and I think the painters for the most complete team but you don't the other thing to talk about the Dallas Cowboys it's not over this you know they can recover from this we were what was it a couple weeks ago the Giants were all into maybe the worst giant team we've ever seen I hear people talking about it and look where they are now so this league can change the Cowboys have difference makers that can help them win games they've just got to find a way to win a game here or a couple without Tony Romo and Dez Bryant I'll tell you where the Giants are if they win tonight Hosting San Francisco they will now be in sold position so possession in the first place in the NFC East go over to pick baton tries to go between a cup of a Patriots picks up nine got a long streak going scoring touchdowns talking about the Cowboys third longest streak in the league 65 consecutive games but they got four minutes a little more than four minutes to try to keep that going that picks up the first McFadden written down by Collins that was Brandon Weeden I would do that every time until they take it away from me well the Cowboys when they lost Romo with the broken clavicle you had to say well what what can this team go hearing Tony's absence as Wheaton just flips it back over third straight time couldn't make bad news and they're about to lose for the third straight time I thought they could probably go 500 that looks like that's gonna be really tough to do of course after a Nolan 3 start but the a couple things now if they got Greg Hardy back that gives us some hope and more playmakers on the defensive side but the offensive line just can't dominate we saw last year between turn around the rabbit is Beasley might be fun Brown was a great thrown cats that time by Beasley and Brandon Weeden as the longest pass play of the game for Dallas 21 yards but the offensive line in DeMarco Murray I look they're running the football game with DeMarco Murray his style his size with this offensive line perfectly and Jason Witten out of bounds at the 33 the Cowboys now all for this game you're gonna drop to two and three they have the bye week coming up then the second game of the season against the New York Giants ooh they suddenly gotten hot here the Cowboys beat him week one the Giants again tonight going for a third straight win second and seven where's the Giants really could have won every single game to this point yes they could I'll tell you what was impressive about the Giants they played the Buffalo Bills week last week Eli Manning against the Buffalo Bills they're great defensive front was hit one time in the game to tell you that Wheaton has hit 19 of his last 20 passes and I know you're gonna say of all a lot of them have been of the short variety they'd have a one down the field for 21 to Beasley but do you know listen this is the world we live in this is what the NFL is about and the discussion will be about Brandon Weeden the fact that his starting record as a quarterback the fact that they're all increases Tony Romo has gone out and scramble for another pounds at the 11:00 so we reached the twominute warning and Dallas trying to least put up a touchdown before this one's completed tonight on CBS begins with 60 minutes in a wideranging interview with President Obama followed by new episodes of Madam Secretary The Good Wife and CSI cyber only CBS America's number one Network Robert Kraft has made his way down to the field with three of his grandchildren as the Patriots will try to keep Dallas out of the end zone here in the last a minute 53 seconds and incomplete going for Escobar was Patrick Chung defended that perfectly yep that's the Trung a safety place up inside a lot plays tight ends good job that time the Patriots really deep doubt the safety position laughter Jordan widget Richards from Stanford when he's played he's done well two and down for Wheaton as everywhere as he flings it and complete one of the mottos that you picked up on over Bally ranch over the Cowboys facility private holding defense number 23 if I was half the distance to the goal line automatic first down is how you'll see it right here behold now coach Garen wanted to use a a mannequin instead of a will a symbol of what nameless faceless go out and that's that's who were playing that's about us let's do our job don't worry about the team were playing that man again I saw it a really goodlooking uniform and he kind of told us the story they honestly travel with the mannequin and put him in the locker room he's waiting back to the end zone too high but you know they got a lot of work to do the Cowboys I mean now this was a tremendous effort I thought today by the Patriots even on the defensive side but they really this they need time to figure out what they're gonna do on offense to help themselves to be more productive to take pressure off of their defense you know Jim their defense probably the biggest problem they had to date is they had to keep going out there after three plays you know they had so many three announced the Cowboys did in that first half talked about defense it's about efforts be hustle six of those occasions in the first half three and out so to the field in a hurry as Wheaton on second and goal completes the pass from maybe a yard it's anything at all no incomplete Wheaton though he'll one tell you that Romo has been a tremendous teammate trying to get him through this stretch they and dinner together Thursday night here he compared backing up Romo to backing up Derek Jeter popularity and I know slow mo had won the championships but I'm down here they think of him that's right like he's Derek Jeter which Wheaton was drafted by the Yankees back in the 2002 baseball's now because of the enzone inattentively again heading back to Escobar well one more attempt here they hit a play like that last week to tie the game against the New Orleans Saints down the sideline on fourth down but they meet he needs to quit relying on that type of play because you're just not gonna hit a high percentage run the offense don't look out thinking oh I got a fade i'ma throw it look at the receivers inside whatever give them the chance and not just put it up for a jump ball on the outside timeout called by the Patriots so the Patriots just looking at the standings in the AFC East they go to four and oh the Jets on a bye this week three and one what a start that's been for there's new coach Todd Bowles Buffalo wins today on the road at Tennessee another Road win after winning at Miami a few weeks before that and the Dolphins on a pie with a new coach new interim coach Dan Campbell and here's the NFC East with the Cowboys falling to two and three Giants again tonight and you've got the Redskins and the Eagles also a two and three so it's gone bad three weeks in a row your one game half a game right now out of first place depending on what the giant feet away Weedon man open and he missed him Terrence Williams was all alone boy really great moved that time by Terrence Williams against Malcolm Butler that kind of just sums up the day for the Cowboys football team especially on the offensive side and they look it gets rough when you're in a quarterback in situations like this keep your head down don't read the papers and of course don't listen to talk radio and I think about your job get better and find a way to win so this is gonna be the first game since September 26 2011 the Dallas does not score and touchdown a game in which they beat the Redskins on 6 Bailey field goals 1816 but you know we talked about Cassel earlier but given that they're going to have the bye week another if you will extra time for extra three or four days forecastle to learn the playbook do you think they might try to get things looking a little bit different a new energy by going castle out of the out of the by I don't think so I think you heard JC Garrard talked to Tracy Wolfson at halftime they feel like Brandon Weeden made really good strides in those first two games today was not the best but they're done I think they'll definitely have him as their starting quarterback in two weeks after this file Tom Brady 275 yards two touchdowns those two coaches both sons of coaches Steve Belichick and Jim Garrett Romo and Belichick have a moment and after eight years since the last time New England came this way they stepped into this building for the first time and win it on a one signing of one sided affair 32 6:30 to 6:00 tonight on CBS begins with 60 minutes new episodes of Madam Secretary The Good Wife and CSI cyber Phil I'll see you and Tracy and all the crew Thursday night down in New Orleans for Atlanta and the Saints Jim Nantz saying so long from Dallas you've been watching the NFL on CBS home of Super Bowl 50 you",

  "transcript": "television Cam Newton matching up against JJ walk the kickoff is straight ahead CBS Sports welcomes you to the following presentation of the National Football League welcome back to a beautiful day in Charlotte North Carolina the sun is shining it is 83 degrees it is tradition here in Charlotte prior to a Panthers game to town the drum keep pounding is the phrase and honor of the late Carolina Panther player and coach Sam Miller and the honors today fall's an NBA MVP Steph Curry who hails from these parts as well as just as well as he drops the 3pointer let's go down to came here at all Jamie will drag with Mookie clean out with the concussion you and Trent mentioned the big hole up the middle defense now that responsibility falls to back up thirdyear Pro AJ client Ron Rivera told us that he's very lucky this linebacking group is already very vocal in fact this summer the Panthers miked up the linebackers and the safeties at OTAs and mini camps and passive players listened back to those tapes to make sure they were communicating properly on the field now that responsibility because duties Lee calls the defensive plays with this team falls to EJ Pine Creek Thank You Jamie big Ron Rivera told us yesterday that a lot of people were very surprised at what they heard on those tapes when they were played back yeah you sometimes as the player you don't necessarily know all the conversations that go on you know what you're focused on but some of that can be a surprise Carolina on the receiving end of the opening kick and it will not be returned Houston won the toss and deferred so that means Cam Newton the Carolina quarterback number one pick overall back in 2011 175 yards and a touchdown throwing last week and another 55 on the ground Trent he's a combination threat we talked about that in the opening the fact that as the defensive unit the Texans need to maintain their rush lanes they need to maintain their gaps because if you leave a crease Cam Newton will find it Jonathan Stewart in the backfield along with Cam Newton who will work out of the shotgun and he will throw on first down sideline going for the interception on the past to Greg Olson was number 27 Clinton Demps Brian Khalil is the veteran in the middle of the Panthers offensive line in his ninth season out of USC and Jonathan Stewart rushed for 56 yards in last week's win at Jacksonville he caught four passes for another 25 second attempt slap Matson complete off the fingertips up set in junior Texans have the best defensive player in football up front in JJ Watt after an injury played rookie season Houston feels last year's number one overall pick to Debian clowny is rounding into playing shape and like clowny cornerback Jonathan Joseph hails from Rock Hill South Carolina just 27 miles from here third and 10 Martha's slide that looked like number 74 my crummers the right tackle cleat Blakely is our referee today the Carolina talking last week's game not getting the ball to Greg Olson enough coming down on first down they're trying to squeeze it to him and Quentin dense as you say Craig was it was all over then on second down can't put a little heat on that one on the slants dead again see the person coming off the slide here that's a black comes in neutral zone infraction Brian Cushing so the Texans take it then they give it away what's important here on third down keep an eye on where Greg Olson is going to be and where that matchup is going to be in the middle of the field chick doesn't left his head and it falls incomplete like Brian Cushing may have been in on the Carolina quarterback and it'll be the punting unit onto the field well you have to be calculated with the pressure that you bring in Romeo Crennel talk to me about that he said with Cam Newton you have to maintain those wrestling's you want to put pressure on him but you want to keep him in the pocket because when he breaks outside the pocket that's when you really expose what's going on on the defensive side of the ball Brad Norton will kick it away to Keith Humphrey this is returnable across the 25 to about the 27 yard line 60 yard punt in an 8 yard return and here comes number 15 Ryan Mallett missed it season out of Arkansas making only his third career start today appearing in just his 9th NFL game his job to keep Trent you know Ryan Mallett is it isn't on a short lease we talked to Coach O'Brien about that and he said you know of a form a plane experience standpoint Ryan Mallett has less plane experience so they want to give him an opportunity to see what he can do and obviously that's why he's getting start here today they'll mix up on the snap looks like mallet might have gotten the ball sooner than he expected it starting left tackle Dwane Brown out with a hand injury today making for a major shuffling on the line Chris Clark replaces him Jeff Adams and Derek Newton switch sides Arian Foster not ready yet to return at running back DeAndre Hopkins had the big day last week with 98 yards receiving and two touchdowns lost again on the place secondary 11:4 into the hands and dropped by Garrett grin upfront for the Panther defense Charles Johnson has 62 and a half career sacks pile of starts for Starla two delays not get back from foot surgery middle linebacker Luke Kuechly up with the concussion protocol we told you a Jake line starts for him and cornerback Josh Norman had quite today last week was forced fumble a fumble recovery and a 30yard pick six 13 the other Josh Norman dust norman anticipated that and jumped all over it trying to get a quick wide receiver screen as norman reads it from the snap beats the block and is able to come up with the tackle for loss when we asked Josh Norman yesterday do you like to talk on the field he said little bit he said he said I don't like to start it but I'll finish it if someone else wants to get on Ted Ginn jr. is deep and make this the fall for the fair catch when we get up Italy Martin are down on the near sideline so here's cleat Blakeman personal foul the singing team number 21 wait we're not miles adopt an opponent it's a 15yard penalty from the end of the kick first down Carolina that's Teddy Williams a spear quarterback for Carolina so that is going to back Cam Newton and the Panthers up and we'll take the timeout with 13 11 to play in the first this is the NFL on CBS second Carolina penalty of the day as the Panthers starting to narrow in 15yard line and it's Johnathan Stewart time for us to go green you talked about the pass rush a compressor that the two outside edges bring here JJ Watt to your left and to Debian clowny to the right it looks like they're gonna pressure with the Blitz but the inside guys drop out in the zone blitz clowny comes from right to left up the middle bring pressure up the slot the number four defender that you see there that does not allow Alex Smith to set his feet plus is Alex Smith into the pocket that's where JJ Watt picks up the sack we have an injured Carolina Panther on one knee at the 17 yard line looks to be maybe Trey Turner the right guard with that we will take a break with 12 52 to play in the first here in Charlotte one of the best places for fan player interaction that was the Panthers in an after practice feast with some of the locals here's a handoff to Jonathan Stewart and Stewart up across the 20 to the 21 yard line let's go back to that injury and see what happened well let's take a look right here you'll see his ankle gets rolled up on by Vince Wilfork watch here as the play continues Wilfork just falls right into the back of his leg you don't want to speculate obviously it's a lower leg injury right now Chris Scott is in the game at right guard that's 62 325 falling on your Edmond and that's what's on the paper on third and fourth Cam Newton with time throwing and came up way short of his intended receiver Kareem Jackson the nearest let's go down to Jamie well Greg I know it looked like that left ankle got rolled on too but when they came to the sidelines Trey Turner is actually having his left knee worked on and he just walked down the tunnel on his own accord with no help but they want to go check it out a little more all right Jamie thank you so no first down for Carolina on this possession either on the one put pressure on Cam Newton on that last play with JJ Watt he was being doubleteamed by tight end great by Ed Nixon and the running back has ever get too impressive England this is mumphrey back to his own 19 flies in from behind as he has brought down at about the 33 or 34 yard line and now another flag is thrown the laundry's out early today Trent yeah there have been reviews but a lot early on I think it's important though as the Texans take the field here to get Ryan Mallett into some kind of rhythm I know that first series they tried the wide receiver screen they tried the the quick throw into the flat neither one of those was successful I think it's important to get him into a little bit of a rhythm here early on during the return illegal block in the back return team number 57 to 10yard penalty from the spine of bow first down Houston so Justin Tuggle is guilty of the foul on the play where there are some key people missing from this Houston versus Carolina matchup today Arian Foster still not ready to play yet after glorious surgery Dwane Brown we told you out at the hand injury Luke Kuechly concussion installed a tool man not yet ready the pictures push down my fate on the way in and out of the hands of his intended receiver Nate Washington and Washington have lots and lots of room to run well the Texans had pretty much sold out on the fact that they were going to throw this ball deep that DeAndre Hopkins on the far side of the field going deep and Nate Washington on the underneath trying to drag across but the delicate throw to make when you have the defender cutting underneath than with mallet on the rollout that makes it a much more difficult throw for him he would rather stand in the pocket anchor his feet as opposed to being thrown on the move that's not his play as much as it is Brian Hoyer ziz it well when you get flustered when Horner warriors strength is as opposed about second turn what Passover in a minute and complete and the whistles look like he ran out of time on the play clock well that ball was to the screen he soon takes a timeout this will be their first timeout so to avoid the penalty Houston took a timeout early the first one used in the game 1142 to play in the first back to Carolina after this there's Brian lawyer week one starter for Houston Texans secondly $10 matter not much offense on display here today steps up and falls over for the tight end Garrett Graham so far six total yards on offense for Houston plus six for Carolina which adds up to zero total yards for both teams so far you know if you're into defensive football this is the place to be right now neither quarterback has got comfortable Tim Newton's been under pressure on one end of the field and Ryan Mallett has yet to settle down that time they're having to tighten across the middle start the fires a little too hard overstriding good job when this sign has his man five and out of bounds at about the 38 or 39 yard line DeAndre Hopkins well that's just a straight straight full of their Greg DeAndre is gonna get an outside release here trying to get across Josh Norman space he crosses it on the sidelines mallet has the ability to step up and just throws a laser on the sideline he that that arm strength was on display on that play Josh Norman told us Hopkins is the bell cow for this offense new set of downs from now pushed down tattoos in their own 38 and Malak to the nearside and again that's Hopkins in and out of his hands and Norman was right there DeAndre Hopkins played well in the debut last week against Kansas City tied a careerhigh with nine catches 98 yards scored two touchdowns and also had a twopoint conversion well that's coming off of a big season a year ago over 1200 yards receiving there's his mom there trying to stay tuned yeah Venus Chris perfect can't get out of the grass with curtain Coleman polkas they're changed change of pace back they put him on the field and good receiver out of the backfield tends to being outside the tackle cycle runner that time getting it off the middle Wow jumping over the line of scrimmage is number 97 Mario Addison who had two sacks last week offside defense number 97 still third then Mario Addison right here on the edge he's the one that gets jumped offsides last week having two sacks in the game against Jacksonville he little antsy wanted wanted to pick up that third sack of the season three penalties last week for Carolina three already today two tight ends now for Houston on 31 because pulp the feedback that they give it to the first pack drew J cross and prash across midfield into Carolina territory for a first down hey never miss a little football action with the CBS Sports app every play every story and every highlight right as they happen download the CBS sports app now props with his first carry of the season gets a first down on the Hopkins and we gonna pendulum off the flying looks like they're gonna call Justin woman on the whole Hopkins is running the slant route prior to the pass holding defense number 24 say look Greg even from up here both quarterbacks I've had a chance to throw a slant today and they both with our fire and head in there here at the bottom of your screen Norman you can see it's it it's a hold of the left shoulder pad at the Andre Hopkinton that's what draws the flag it's hidden to make that a little bit more catchable ball on the slam both guys are talking the lady needs to cover adjustment to make that throw Chandler worthy in the backfield now the mallet has no place to throw it and so he just bounces it off the turf things looking very uneven on offense right now for Houston 1 you have to remember there's a lot of changes on that offensive line with Dwane Brown out of the game newly added Chris car clipped Chris Clark just picked up in a trade from Denver is now playing left tackle right tackle Derrick Newton is over to left guard you still have Jones at Center and Brooks at right guard but Jeff Adams his plane right tackle so you have three of the five offensive lineman to change them the week ago the third and short balances way to Mountain Carolina 42 or 43 yard line see swords coming in motion they're just a quick flip almost a shovel pass really you know last week JJ Watt lost his helmet on the play these these Texans have to use a better glue yeah he didn't quit on the play handed or get the sack even without the helmet bird Nate in the pocket wide open over the middle Jonathan Grimes out of the backfield inside the 30 for a first down mallet calling the troops order Brian about the 25yard line trying to get in some tempo now picking up a couple first downs you can see the Texans are staying up in the line of scrimmage trying to trying to hurry that tempo up doesn't allow the defense to change bodies out we talked about Shawn McDermott liked to change his fresh bodies in on defense Mallon on the move Joey just misses connections with Nate Washington West Horton applying the pressure for Carolina coming off the edge now it's trying to buy time with his feet rolling out of pocket Washington just with a corner route he tries thrown the defense to sleep by coming inside and then heading off to the corner once again mallet on the move is not necessarily the thing he's most comfortable with third and six with grinds in the backfield once again you see Hopkins and and that stuff at the top of the screen again now a quick pass off the fingertips of Keith mumphrey and he was open good decision by mallet going away from that roll coverage they tend to be rolling coverage over towards where Hopkins is if it's not mantoman this time montrezl sits open right in the middle of the zone you see the three defenders around him good read good route does bad execution on squeezing that ball yeah you gotta catch that one here's Randy Bullock from 43 yards and it is good so with 757 to play in the first the Houston Texans jump on top three nothing back at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte 3nothing in favor of the Houston Texans they go 53 yards and 13 plays and pull up with the 43yard field goal Fozzy Whittaker is deep along with Joe Webb and no one gets a chance to return this one that touch back will bring it out to the 20yard line hey your weekend begins right here with Thursday Night Football on CBS and NFL Network Washington visits Eli Manning and the New York Times right here on your all the Super Bowl 50 CBS ports to the Giants they lead that series all time they've won five of the last six outings Trey Turner back onto the field at right guard now for Carolina can be decided by a and nobody breathe out basta 30 for a first down Cam Newton Cam Newton with a big first down there on the run but going back to his first full pass attempts doesn't have a completion yet coming out early time to get the ball to Greg Morrison depths undercuts it that time just throwing it too hard on the slant route to Ted Ginn and then the next two pass attempts get tipped into the line of scrimmage so starting this game off over four still looking for that first completion pushes it and being tumbled to the ground is Jonathan Stewart and that wasn't pretty let's get our first update of the day back to New York JB and coach Cowher Gregg as you know turnovers hurt yeah after Terrance West Columbia Isiah Crowell take some since an 11 yards out in Cleveland 14nothing lead over Tennessee back to Greg Trent and Jamie JB turnovers hurt us I know they kill coach Cowher loss of 3 on the play second and 13 nuki from behind to Demyan clowny disrupting that play he's coming off the edge up top you'll see he's able to to beat that pressure or beat the block off the edge and cam trying to get the ball out of his hand and that's the third time now six pass attempts three of them his arms either been hit or the balls being tipped Wow across the 30 up to about the 33 34 not nearly enough for a first down and the thing that has impressed me about both these defenses is the way they swarm to the football as we got a player injured down on the field it's like Jericho Cotchery who was in on the blocking on that play so they will look at him we will take a timeout with 625 to play in the first quarter you were watching the NFL on CBS home of Super Bowl 50 and terrico cancer is on the right side of your screen there he's going to fall over the top of his teammate at Dixon bring down a penalty marker flies mumphrey hit by Teddy Williams number 21 let's see what the penalty is the officials get sore on Sunday markers claim elites being very thorough today there have been a lot of flags here early on we've seen a lot of good defense and a lot of penalties that's that's how this first quarter is going so far during the return Billy the block in the back return team number 21 contending yard penalty first down in Houston the penalty is on Darryl Morris let's go back to that play that injured Jericho Khatri you see loading onto the cart there will see cats are here on the right side of the screen and watch teammate that Nixon as he's trying to get a block here it's Dixon that falls right into the back right leg of cautery he needed help off the field and we saw that before you get to that cam and get it card into the lock we know meanwhile and move out so about the 17yard line want to remind you that we too continues later today on Fox and then tonight with Sunday Night Football on NBC tune in tomorrow from Monday Night Football on ESPN you get a chance to tell you trying how how thrilled I was to see that you survived the summer of deflategate that was brought up over and over and over again so I think just like everybody else me glad that it's appears to be over with for now can't avoid it game over wrapped up back at the can and a couple of penalty markers while Kyla love was celebrating Charles Johnson was depressed personal foul grabbing the facemask defense number 95 15yard penalty from the previous spot first down Houston Shawn Johnson says it's on me he's given to my bad here's Johnson 95 here on the right side of your screen oh I'd say that's one of those ones oops see the left hand pulling the facemask he immediately looked at the official like did you see it I felt it but did you see it they see getting everybody's side five and a half to play here in the first the best Mirza this is Gordon much of anything maybe for about three or four yards Aspen King well great we saw Jericho cotchery walk off the field couldn't put any weight on that right foot until he got to the cart they checked out his right ankle he is questionable to return a couple of his teammates walked over including Greg Olson to give him some support before he left the field all right Jamie thank you out of trouble and he is stacked up at up a 33 and a half yard line new commitment by Kirk Coleman see him there on the screen he's came up and run support once he saw the tightend block that's who he was lined up over man the man covered soon as he saw the door rents go into a blocking stance then he came on the pressure on I was able to make that tackle this is a game and need some offense by someone 37 and a late flag one two three four five personal foul unnecessary roughness defense from the 50game Elena hit on the runner first down Houston you know if you could grab Thomas Davis and tell him you know one ref might be wrong but before flags flying it was kind of a given especially when you hit to the head or neck area here the player is already down see Davis come flying in put that right shoulder right into Grimes chin pretty much says he's looking around that is the third forced down by penalty for the Houston Texas Valley deep drop down the sideline looking for Hopkins incomplete go are covered by Norman with a little help from Roman Harper the safety so yeah Harper in the middle of the field it's it's mantoman coverage you'll see Hopkins is here right back here is Harper he's going to try to get back Malik comes back off the play fake watch the arm strength he has his feet aren't really set he's falling to his left and he's just able to flick that ball out there good 55 60 yards second and 10 off customary dude's got CC right there on the sideline now miscommunication on the far side Charles Tillman almost came up with the interception pass intended from mumphrey he'll be third and ten and that time there I believe maladjusted misses on the backside here you're gonna see Josh Norman he's going to come on the pressure over here then you're gonna have an out route when you have that type of pressure coming from the backside you can see on the front it's a zone here you have an open receiver on the backside that's being aware from a protection standpoint it was picked up by the back but that's his mallet being aware with that rotation and that covers and ten for the touch the screen why and Grimes forward to about the 41 gonna be about five yards shy of a first down and no sign of the punting unit coming on yet we talked about this with with coach O'Brien about his decisions of when you want to be risky and then it's calculated risk how do you feel he obviously feels very confident what his defense is doing to be able to go forward a disposition to the field korkin five they need the 36yard line for first now what's the combination of players up here you have a bunch for Mason you have three players together that causes confusion by the defense if you can pick somebody else out of the backfield is blind then he is about two yards one of the first down Shaq Thompson the first round draft pick out of Washington made the hit so with that the ball will go over on downs that drive cut short and Carolina in possession when we come back look at the Panthers first three possessions what does that tell you Trent that tells you why Bill O'Brien went for it on fourth down at the the 41 yard line it's having that confidence in his defense the way they've been able to get Carolina off the field Carolina had great time with possession in their opener last week more than 34 minutes they've had but in their first three possessions they've possessed the football for 24 seconds a minute 19 in a minute 32 Newton now on first down play fake lots and lots and lots of time and now Newton takes off and dives across the 40 up to about the 42 yard line clock continues to move to 40 to play here in the first quarter and this is what this is where Houston you're going to go there go deep here but Houston they're only going to rush for guys on their defensive front and drop seven into coverage they typically so you've got four guys here in the rush but then look at all these bodies back here in coverage moment you've only got three receivers on 2nd and 6th Augustus Stewart Stewart sits at the 40 just as he crosses midfield and into Houston territory at the 48 yard line run out of bounds by Justin Tuggle while I'm finishing up with my last thought now I was good decision by Cam Newton to run the football not force it downfield this time on the draw play to Stuart he's able to break contain and get outside and pick up the first down Cam Newton to Paris for 15 yards so far today and this is school let's do it the another tackler in the backfield have been hit hard as he approached the 45 yard line Tuesday it's a matchup you don't want to miss Stephen Colbert goes oneonone with Donald Trump this Tuesday on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert we were in the last minute and a half for sporting in the backfield on second and seventh in the backfield play fake and now he crawls beside behind that is complete to the tight end Greg Olson out of bounds about a yard short of a first down and Cam Newton was hit low that time by JJ wide it looks like he's gonna get blocked into it actually wasn't what it was John Simon coming off that side but this is a pretty protective of quarterbacks legs but when they're blocked down into it they're not going to make that call good accurate throw with someone all over him for progress was marked at the 38 which is enough for a first down though the Panthers knocking on the door straight drops for Newton he's gonna go for it all down the far side of the field get out about Ted Ginn jr. even though Cam's eyes weren't over there from the beginning of the play he knew he had mantoman coverage based on the rotation here you have Ginn 101 with Jackson going down the left sideline soon as Newton leaves from Center he notices safety in the middle of the field he knows what his route is it's already built in keeping his eyes keeping that safety the middle of the field and taking a shot down inside second and ten setting up the screen and it almost blew up in his face Mike Tolbert and Bernard Rick McKee the rookie linebacker out of Mississippi State was right there what a great read by McKinney that ball almost could have been a pick six with the way that Cam Newton floats this ball you're gonna see McKinney coming here from the middle of the field he reads it he reads it Newton has to just flop it up over the top of the rushers really have nothing on it I could play by the young man on Mississippi State makes it a third and Carolina and we will come to the end of the first quarter before the snap we played one here in Carolina three nothing Houston Greg Gumbel Trent Green Jamie our dog back in Charlotte we are all in agreement that neither team is burning up the offensive numbers third and 13 good protection in and out of hand to tip him Junior and that time Newton was right on target well he's beating Jonathan Joseph Ginn is just on a dig route you see this Paul hits him right in the chest he jumps up and instead of catching it with his hands he jumps up and tries to catch it with his body that's ultimately what leads to the ball hitting his shoulder pads or the chest plate of his shoulder pads and causing the ball to bounce off that's really that's really the first time camp newtons have an opportunity to throw the ball downfield cleanly the other times they he's been under pressure or the guys have been covered we're at Northland trying to plant this when inside the 5yard line it takes let's see it'll be marked into the end zone so it did cross the goal line then came up for the touchback and that means that Houston will start from its own 20yard line and watch the ball is it Dennis crosses right on the goal line there I have the right bounce on it look at that shot aerial coverage of today's game provided by Met Life it's proud of you we get to North Carolina you get to whip out your accident a little bit and work on that get some barbecue around here too yeah Mike Chris Hulk on the carry for a yard it'll be second and nine Kyle love with the tackle here's Mallon some of his early throws you see when he sets his feet he's got a strong arm and he's accurate this next one has a little too much heat on it but he's more productive when he's able to anchor his feet in there and fire the football as opposed to moving around and that's been evident here certainly stuff too now in the first in and pulled out to about 25 to come before and it'll be 35 car Coleman up from the secondary well George Godsey told us the offensive coordinator for the Texans told us last week against Kansas City falling behind the way they did it they don't want they don't want to throw the ball 50 times the game they didn't want to put the ball in the air that much that's just the necessity because of the way that game was going they'd like to have some balance in they're having a hard time today one of the good guys he's to the rumble ball eight times flown at 17 so far today and now at control year in that pass making the diving catch on the far side is DeAndre Hopkins now Josh Norman says take a look at that I don't think so you know I'm all the way on the other side of the stadium and I know that officials ten yards away from him but it looks a bit like it hit the ground from way over here but and on that replay it looked the same so Ron Revere is going to challenge this you know that looked a lot like a Steph Curry dribble so they'll take a look we'll take a break you're watching the NFL on CBS the home of Super Bowl 50 as we take another look we get to say hello for the first time today it might carry our officiating expert what you think Mike hey Greg well the rule is if the ball hits the ground before the receiver has controlled it's incomplete you can see the receiver may have had his hand over a portion of the ball under it but the ball clearly hits the ground this is an obvious clear threeperson this is an obvious layup for Mike Carey do you realize the best we got to bring my gift for the tougher ones all right Mike thank you that's right so Mike Carey is want to know so far why that cleat was under the hood may be listening to Mike's analysis on that I think that was that was pretty clear the key is they got it right all right Mike thank you fourth and five and Shane LeClair 16th year in the lead 62 to 37 at Texas A&amp;M and he has been one of the great putters for a long time back out across the 25 to the 26 only one more day until the biggest premiere in the universe you won't want to miss the first new episode of the season The Big Bang Theory on its new night tomorrow at 8:00 7:00 central here on CBS down to Jamie our doc Gregg we saw Jericho Cochrane wide receiver leave the game earlier with the right ankle injury he was evaluated he just came out ran a couple 15 yards up and down the sideline said he was okay and now he's back on the fields the Panthers offense Thank You Jamie he's not only been evaluated he's been rejuvenated that's a that's a big surprise get the scene back out of here first down Newton and the Panthers on the move as a first down and more you want out of bounds across the 42 there 41 yard line let's get another update from the NFL today in New York JP hey Greg here's the evaluations big bad and unstoppable yeah Rob Gronkowski who did couple with the DB can't cover him here right there second touchdown pass to Tom Brady 21 7 New England over Buffalo hey Greg and you were right earlier and coach hates turnovers back to Greg Gumbel show me a coach that isn't crazy over turnovers newton growing sidelines complete an extra tight end Greg Olson how about the sly smile on Cam Newton space when you ask him if you think you might throw to Greg Olson a little more today than you did last week he gives us one of those looks like I'm not going to tell you but I think my look will tell you and pretty clear that they're trying to get him to football been targeted several times today and that's a better route for him to run the other one ditch this sitting over here is more of a hit try that one that's a runaway route if you do mr. Stewart Stewart run away out the middle inside the 42 about the 37 and a half yard line good job up front you'll see Stewart here on the handoff just a counterplay following his block through the middle created a big lame form some of this could be the fact that the Texans defense has been on the field for so long second and short yardage here now for Newton with 12 art in the backfield brought down by Kareem Jackson the quarterback it's about discipline within the defense maintaining your rush lanes and keeping leverage that time on the back side the defense collapsed allowing Tolbert to cut back and find an opening 49yard Drive you see how that compares with their first full drive going for the endzone wide open touchdown Thank You Junior the Texans attempt to bring pressure rushing five this time they don't get to Cam Newton allowing the oneonone on the outside the double move a double move by Ted Ginn jr. there's get here now go up two hits in a little twirl with that type of protection in the pocket Cam Newton's able to put it right into the corner he beat AJ boy yay on the play the extra point is good damn Newton his second touchdown pass of the season and the Panthers are up seven three and that's what happens on off days the u.s. national White Water Center here in Charlotte North Carolina Cam Newton first floor drives he went for of 11 throwing for a total of seven yards and on that last drive two out of two for 37 yards including a 25 yard touchdown pass seven three Panthers Clinton Dems deep an onside kick almost looked like a like a mistake Jonathan Grimes covered it for Houston sea bream de no did he pull up at the last second I'm guessing it's a wreak it cuz the ball fell off the tee and then good thing the official was on top of it whose the magnitude of that earthquake that hit that had a little tilt on the ball anyway but clearly it fell off the tee there's no wind that let's go back to that that let's go back to that touchdown pass but I want you to tell you to show you what Cam Newton is looking at here you have all guys up in the line of scrimmage you have a defender rushing Cam Newton is going to use his eyes up the field on this safety who's going to be oneonone but then you got Ted Ginn here is just running it up and go so you see all of the things that are going on with the defense that's what Cam Newton has focused in on he realizes when the pressure comes that he's got mantoman on the outside once he realizes his guys pick up that pressure that's when he knows he's going to be able to celebrate because he's got the oneonone and having the time to make that throw now look back to working out throwing and he's got the man complete across the 35 and close to the 40yard line that's tight end CJ the doorless that's good for a first down at the 39 well and playaction passing allows that to happen when you can get some run game going get a little bit of things going on the ground it's those linebackers to fight up and you can hit that tight in in that second window right now and the shotgun put the pass over the middle and that is incomplete intended for Garrett Graham the other tight end a reminder for you replay every game of the 2015 season on demand with NFL game pass for the Winnefeld optom slash game pass to start your free trial well that was all the pocket being pushed back in the mallets face there's only four guys rushing everybody drops into cupboards he wanted to anchor down in there that's what happened somebody got in his face he wasn't able to make an accurate throw throwing sidelines almost intercepted Josh Norlin going up high looking for his second of the season well that's a little catandmouse my defensive coordinator Shawn McDermott showing five guys at the line of scrimmage like they're going to throw further like they're going to blitz so mallet thinks he has mantoman cupboards on the outside but in reality you see by the way Norman is playing the ball lifting back at the quarterback he knows he has helped over the top that allows him to cheat on that route and almost get the interception third and ten we put the Panthers a job in coverage with a cell here now on the move again shakes one tackle about the 34 33 yard line Charles Johnson and dawan Edwards giving chase once again we go back we've been talking about it with the Texans we can also talk about it with Carolina's defense when you can rush for drop seven in two covers and still apply the pressure that's where you're giving yourself a huge advantage Ted Ginn jr. he of the touchdown reception back inside his own 15yard line for the kick and he grabs it for 22 across the 35 absolu about the 40yard line 1005 to play in the first half Ryan Mallett down by the ankle 7 3 Panthers and Charles Johnson is going to come off the edge here and he's just going to come right up the middle as they do this te stunts you'll see he comes clean as a quarterback you're fine with pressure off the edges because you can step up in the pocket but when pressure comes up the middle and you're forced to flush it takes away all your reeds and all your progression clamp and that doesn't fit well with what mallet likes to do on first down listen Jonathan Stewart is Stewart firm up twos across the 40 to the 41 yard line Jadeveon Clowney all excited about playing in front of the home folks he's from Rock Hill South Carolina just 27 miles away and South Pointe high school he played offense defense special teams the number one consensus player in the nation coming out of high school he ran the ball 32 times for 277 yards and nine touchdowns he was hysterical and Cotchery his markdown across midfield this was the read option but with with the Hopsin part of it so here he's able to fake out cloudy then he's able to get up to that next level just back to the old college option play it's justin Tuggle in the backfield in counselor he's able to pick up everything from our campers in houston territory again Newton decided appeal complete to techie in junior that was a bullet Greg and the thing to point out there with Ted Ginn what he did that time as he caught the ball with his hands instead of jumping and trying to catch it with his chest which is where the ball bounced off before that time he just reached up trusted his hands and was able to bring it in that feels like someone has alerted the offense just shy of the 35 yard line but enough for another first down autumn Jonathan Joseph continues to playoff coverage they'll just take those little five and seven yarders all the way up and down the field Newton has completed six in a row now looking for seven in a row he's got it outside of the Fiat complete to filling Brown down to the 21 yard line in the pushdown give credit to this offensive line wants the protection you're gonna see filly Brown out here he's just gonna go and hang out in this area out here he just floats to the outside but it's the protection that gets Cam Newton the time and gives Brown the time to get open on that far side from the 21 Newton a quick snap and a penalty marker fly well yeah they think of a call cam for moving forward the motion offense number one to fight yard penalty still first down he looked like he was coming to the line to make an adjustment and got the snap it's very rarely called will you see will you see that called on a quarterback here you're gonna see cam and you'll start working towards the line of scrimmage looks like he's going to change the play or attempt to change the player protection a lot of times when the ball is snapped quickly they won't be any penalty at all because you're you're just catching everybody else offguard we're in the fact because he was moving forward that's why that penalty was home rushed in 15 play fake the Stuart lots and lots of time and now he's gonna close to the original line of scrimmage we have a penalty marker in the secondary looks like they're gonna call ahold gonna get it on Kareem Jackson I believe country's covered or moving defense it is on Kareem Jackson will cream Jackson you'll see right here is on Norwood Noor we're just going to make a double move and try and get outside and you'll see Jackson reach his arm around that's what's going to be called the hold right there as he wraps him up he had helping to the top so there was no need for him to gravity me not down at the ten yard line intended for olsen batted down by rahim wore the safety well on this one's on camp noon he stares him down he staring down Greg Olson and that's wherever he more is able to read the eyes and know where he wants to go it cam had gotten rid of that ball a little bit quicker that could have been a completion but with the amount of time the more had now we're getting in the second intent before it one play to get it set up for a better third down Jonathan Stewart 21113 as we come up on six and a half minutes to play here in the first half of a seven three game you know Greg I just saw clowning come running back on the field it made me think of that high school highlight you just showed how about that as a running back if you're a high school defender and you see him as a running back comes ready there's nothing there it's not fair at all look for him wants to come out the edges here third and seven under pressure escapes depression on the moon diving forward to the 10yard line how about the respect that two of those carried both Watt and clowny were doubleteamed on this pass rush and both of them were able to push the doubleteam back in to Cam Newton ultimately force him to plus Bryan pushing in on the stock and a little disturbed field goal attempt upcoming by Graham Cano from 28 yards out is good 526 to play first half the Panthers stretch their lead to 10 3 welcome back to Charlotte 103 Carolina leading the Houston Texans 51 yard drive in just over four and a half minutes resulting in the field goal only 83 degrees players are reacting as if it's a lot this is Chandler he's gonna run it out burden as penalty markers fly he comes up short of the 20yard line David Mayo with the tackle during the return illegal block in the back defense number 35 Finley's half the distance to the goal line first down Houston penalty on Eddie Pleasant little back the Texans up to give us a chance to tell you Saturday the SEC on CBS brings on the best game from the best conference the Tennessee Volunteers tangle with the Florida Gators and it all begins with college football today we're here on CBS Sports now on first down Oh bat it down soon as it left his hand by Toni Ely the defensive end getting quick pressure up the field trying to hit the swing route right here is it's going to try hitting the swing route but ely gets upfield almost close to a backward pass which we're going to quick touchdown for the Panthers but that ball was moving forward Carolina dominating control of the football here in the second quarter second lieutenant year mr. Chris Pope just across the 10yard line we were talking about it during the break Trent that Ryan Mallett needs to complete some passes get some first downs and give that Houston defense chance to rest well great you just showed the time of his Essen for this quarter and even though you said the temperature at 83 degrees it's much hotter down on the field with the humidity in its tight end CJ Fedora was having trouble staying on his feet he is a secondyear tight end out of Iowa almost looks like he's cramping low they're messing with his knee there and for initially I thought maybe he was cramping but we talked about time of possession Greg and just in the second quarter the amount of time that the the Texans defense has been on the field you can see that last series it seemed like they were getting pushed around a little bit which they hadn't been doing prior in the skinny yeah no one usually pushes the Houston defense around when there was a couple times where the head cut back runs where you know either the linebackers over float or the gap responsibilities had broken down and that's what allowed them to get that take a look and see what happened CJ Fedora let's number 87 right right the middle of your screen let's see oh here he is right here and see what happens here as they looked like it already happened as Norman maybe was pressing up against him oh there gets bit back over two miles that leaves the screen there so fedora wits limps off field that leaves tight end duties to Garrett Graham and on occasion as we have seen JJ Watt thanks for the flooring 9 trying to keep the drive alive steps up road incomplete off the hands of Nate Washington defended by Charles Tillman and another flag is down he'll use of hands answer the face offense number 17 that penalties decline brings up fourth down that penalty is on Jeff Adams someone does a nice job and knocking that ball out here we're going to get the hands of the face coming off that edge see Charles Johnson's head was tilting back on that is tech convenient breaks it to the near side and out of bounds at midfield 33 to play in the first half Carolina with the lead in the football again a reminder coming up the Verizon halftime report JB and the guys for all the latest scores and highlights back in the studio in New York they'll have a preview Thursday Night Football on CBS in the NFL Network that's all coming up on the horizon halftime report so yeah we touched a little bit on deflategate and just didn't amaze you how people just lost their minds that summer long yes it was it was a topic of discussion for a long time obviously going back and forth with the league and the Players Association and Tom Brady and what was going on with that obviously the court system now is what about telling the King down to but Gladwell glad we're back to football and incomplete JJ walk in on Cam Newton been happening with number 99 today well they've been doubleteaming him quite a bit you can see here two offensive linemen occasionally here with Dixon via the tide in you get it tight end in the mix and every now and then they'll be crazy enough to put it right back on but that hasn't hasn't fare too well for him so you see the big boys staying on in most of the time 35 catch is made by Devin Funchess the rookie out of Michigan this time Newton recognizes the facts that they're going to bring dimps off the edge snips comes down at safety he comes off the edge you gotta get one on one on the backside once again watch skin catch it with his hands the drop earlier was just oh I'm sorry was Funchess with the ket's catching it with his hands bringing it in not allowing the defensive back to knock it out far side of the field that is complete inside the 25yard line out of bounds at the 23 for the first down to Greg Olson also already seeing lots more action than he did a week ago Olson one on one there in the slot with Jackson gets over to the sideline and what I see right now is the Texans defense that is walking around they seem very tired very sluggish after that completion getting back to the line of scrimmage see laden with hands on hips taking deep breaths JJ Watt working extra hard with any team on first down to the past aside cut down by Kevin Johnson the rookie quarterback out of Wake Forest Cam Newton distributing the ball don't look at that already last week olson only had three targets and one cats today he already has four receptions Newton with time over the middle tip intercepted at the goal line picked off by Raheem more more back to the 15 lost the football covered by detection Justin Tuggle was there to pick up the loose ball when that ball wasn't the tightest Spiro as who is attempting to get the ball to Kevin Norwood Oh his arm was hit so this ball comes out wobbly and Norwood gets his hands on it and this will be an automatic review on the turnover but it appears Raheem more got his hands underneath that who was it that hit the hit Cam Newton's arm was a ginger why they are continuing to take a look upstairs Jared Creek was the one that came through the the defensive lineman that was able to get come through and hit Cam Newton's arm causing the ball to flutter out so the turnover is confirmed and here is Ryan Mallett now with time over the middle the backfield and how to about the 31yard line real quick back to the pressure here's Kirk he's going to be the one that comes out watt on the outside they end up just doing a push in the pocket Creek comes off and he's won two hits Newton's arm causing that ball to flutter in the air when I go up the hands of Kevin Norwood rhymes on the second and one if we put the first down and a few years to have it as we come up on two minutes to play two minutes to play when we come back in the first stab Carolina with the lead he's still the ball fill Network all coming up on the Verizon halftime report he's come the two first downs remaining and a lot of all three of their melon why 38yard line by Rolen Harper I said first down I meant two timeouts remaining at that time their crimes being able to get out of bounds and hit by Roman Harper on the sidelines good decision by Milan not forcing the ball up the field he knows he has a minute move minute 54 he does have the two timeouts as you said Greg plenty of time to keep it in continue to hit the intervene throughout it's not having to post it up the field at this time and Carolina takes a timeout so they use their first timeout and they also now have two timeouts remaining let's talk Super Bowl the Carolina Panthers played in Super Bowl 38 down in Houston and they took on the New England Patriots back and forth game Tom Brady and take the loan both throwing for over 300 yards and three touchdowns and then came down the atom military 41 yards out with four seconds to play Elizabeth 32 to 29 when that was Carolina's only Super Bowl appearance its 21st year of franchise now neaten wants to get him there second and six I pass on his receiver Jonathan Grimes out to dry incomplete well and grind has not only took a big hit but he also saved it intercepts in this ball coming out too high you see the defender that ultimately Davis ultimately puts the hit on Grimes he's the one that would have had the interception head garms not been able to put a handle third and six by calling another timeout they do they use their second this is what happened with Luke Kuechly the middle linebacker for Carolina last week suffering the concussion after they get on jaguars running back TJ Yeldon late in the first half and they were hopeful right up until Friday that he might be able to get back he was not those are the rest of the inactive today you can tell this this Houston offense really misses arian foster care well it's hard to do a combination of backs and it just hasn't worked out up until his play third and six her mouth under the gun rolling over the middle and it bounced short of the intended receiver Nate Washington well Mario Addison was putting the pressure coming off the edge for the Carolina Panthers hitting mallet as he was throwing you'll see at it's Addison coming off the top up here he's the one that just beats Chris Clark off the snap and mallet has to throw that ball sooner than he wants to and really can't get anything into it Ted Ginn jr. calling for the fair catch and he makes that yet about the 14 yard line 1:38 to play here in the first half and Carolina with one timeout remaining and offense there hasn't been much to talk about on either side of the ball Carolina has looked a little better as the game is progressed Carolina's got into some rhythm they're here in the second quarter and that's really when you look at those yards and those numbers a lot of is reflective of what what has gone on here in the in the second quarter that first quarter would they have about seven yards 10 yard and it was a three now three and out for an out so it wasn't a very productive but they figure things out worse Houston is still trying to come up with something to get the ball moving get some points on the board cause you put her in the background when that pass is locked down by 99 Ray J what I would think they'd have watched enough film by now to know that wasn't what's gonna jump up him you know he's he's been known he's all the way up here at the top coming off the edge and he's been known to jump up and snag these out of the air to not just bat him down but catch him and you know that eight yards or whatever it was into the end zone that he needed to just trot in so be careful when throwing that play that way on second and 10 this is which remember when we were talking with Cam Newton yesterday that would you would you prefer to run at JJ Watt or away from him he said neither one to tell you the truth neither ways that either he's gonna hit you the point of attacker he catch you from behind you can see last season among all defensive lineman how many categories he was first in picking up right where he left off last week having six tackles for loss and that was just defensively at five touchdowns that he scored last year three of them on offense and a safety and five fumble recoveries oh and by the way he's 290 and he does all that so pretty impressive for for JJ Watt third and seven now each team downwind time operator deep down the side from Tekken jr. the intended receiver well that was the pressure that was applied from the Texans that time forcing cam to throw that ball earlier than he wanted not allowing him to get the separation the timing just wasn't right so came in to flick it down the sidelines it's amazing when you say you flick it down the safe flicked it down the sideline about 60 65 yard nice flick yeah three get a chance to return this back on 17yard line near side of the field and out of bounds at about the 30yard line it'll bring the Carolina defense onto the field and that includes Thomas Davis back in January Davis was named the 2014 NFL man of the year for his work in the community and for playing excellence to the guys and his lead I just want to say to you let's change this world we're well compensated for what we do let's show these kids how much we care about them they give the media something positive to talk about instead always bash and I lead Thomas Davis good man the players are getting get to talk to him yesterday in our production meeting pushed down from L not only as a player but as a person ng safely and that is Fozzy Whittaker walking off to the locker room early on there's someone down for the Texans and they're all waving to the sideline that is number 70 Jeff Adams the secondyear offensive lineman from Columbia he looked to be a nagging yeah it's his right knee is what he's grabbing as he's going to the ground you don't want to speculate too much but he he obviously isn't a lot of pain as you see him so he's lined up right here Ely is gonna be coming off the edge you can see you can see during the pass rush he just goes down and grabs that that right leg just kind of look like it buckles on him yeah he planned it as the OSU is backpedaling trying to plant that leg you can see him plant that right foot to try and anchor in and immediately hopped up on the one foot and grab that right leg so unfortunately they're bringing the card out on the field and and as if this Houston offensive line wasn't in enough disarray they had some major shuffling up front with Dwane Brown the regular left tackle being deactivated and now Jeff Adams about to be carted off Chris Clark who they just traded for with Denver a few weeks ago was filling in for brown and a left tackle spot atoms as we saw in that last replay was playing right tackle because they move Derrick Newton the normal right tackle over the left guard it's like such a game of chance up front there Trent because last week we got a look at Joe Thomas the fine left tackle for the Cleveland Browns and this is his ninth year in the NFL and he's never missed an offensive snack not one well I have so much respect for those guys up front and the job that they do and the wear and tear that their body goes through and when you see a guy like Joe Thomas a guy that I played with for many years in Kansas City just when the Hall of Fame will Shield's he was another player that had 234 consecutive starts you see those guys and you see the way that they're able to well you know what they put their bodies through it you have to see feel for Jeff Adams as he's getting put on the cart and his teammates are all rallying around him and showing their support teenage paying tribute to Jeff Adams and the opposition keeping their distance but still you can tell it affects them too well it is they all know the amount of work that's put into this you don't want to see anybody get hurt they all spend an entire offseason getting their bodies ready and see a serious injury like that it affects everybody I mean while Kendall Lam a relief reagent offensive lineman out of Appalachian State has come onto the field second and 10 67 seconds left here in the first half Oh now almost intercepted at the 45yard line number 25 been a banned Wickery drew a bead on it and couldn't hold on now once again what's under pressure not able to step into this throw as the pocket collapses around him that wicker is just kicking himself you see him put his hands on his head knowing he had a perfect chance for an interception m\u00e1rio Addison was the one pushing Chris Clark back in the mallets face 13:10 didn't get off in a hurry the lategame offense fiveyard penalty still third down so Bill O'Brien is going to have to address the offensive struggles at halftime well and I don't know how you fix it you only have so many offensive linemen that are healthy so you've got bodies in there but you know it's a matter of having the time to do something with it and pull just across the 25yard line Carolina's gonna use that last time I have the time preserve as much time as they can again being one of the better punt returners in the National Football League Ron Rivera said one of the problems even in the opening game win at Jacksonville was that his team didn't start quickly and he would like to see that they didn't start very quickly a day either they did start quickly today but but for them Houston didn't start quickly either so kind of worked our way through that first quarter be a nice way to put it now in the second quarter Carolina has been able to get some things going but there's still some area of concern there for the Texans Leffler booms one out of there here cut down as he crossed this 25 yard line penalty marker grown on the near side of the field I think the officials gonna ice their arms at halftime they may need to they don't just call the flag they get together and discuss it which is you know they want to get it right but it's definitely made for a longer first half during the kick holding return team number 25 Tony's half the business to the goal line for the end of the kick first down Carolina so that penalty is on Ben and Wickery 46 seconds on the clock Carolina by a touchdown do they look for more here then they go to the locker room with a one touchdown lead well I think based on the penalty and the fact now they're down inside their 10yard line I think it's more of a traditional hand the ball law kind of run the clock out don't take any chances down this close to run I'll give you 20 yard line and that's a first down and you can see Carolina's not necessarily hurrying up to the ball they just want to get some separation from the end zone they don't have to run another snap if they don't want to October and then we'll do it for the first half so the offense of guns not out in force in the first half as the final seconds tick off the clock the Houston Texans manage a field goal Carolina a field goal in a touchdown and at the break the Carolina Panthers with the lead by a score of 10 to 3 let's go down to Jamie well coach in his third career NFL start how do you feel like Ryan Mallett fared the whole team we just got played better you know it's a 10 3 game in a 10 3 game you know another half of football so we just got to go in there make some adjustments and come out ready to go certainly a challenging quarterback but have you contained him the way you want to yeah you know he's a good he's gonna make his plays he's a great player and like I said we're gonna go in there make some adjustments come on play good second half yep Jamie thank you and we have come to the end of the first half here at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte that is the end of the first half 10 3 in favor of Carolina we're back with the Verizon halftime report after this message and a word from your local station you're watching the NFL on CBS the home of Super Bowl 50 welcome back Charlotte as we wait the start of the second half Carolina with a 103 lead on the Houston Texans let's take a look at the DirecTV ultimate picture cam the lone touchdown of the day came from the arm by Ian jr. in the back of the end zone that's the only touchdown we've seen so far this afternoon ten three Panthers Greg Gumbel along with Trent Green we heard Bill O'Brien they used to head coach tell Jamie our doll that they have to go in and make some adjustments what kind of adjustments do you make for Ryan Mallett who's only come was only making a two point three yard for completion well they have problems with protection on the offensive line so there's two directions of thought here you can either add more guys to protection and only put a couple receivers out or you're gonna get more guys in to protect and only have a couple receivers out but let's look at the second half here for Houston you have to find a way to protect mallet you have to find a way to keep him upright and be able to step into his throws that's when he's a more effective quarterback and then for the Panthers it's cam cam and more cam he's the leading rusher for the Carolina Panthers and right now in the second quarter especially he's gotten going in the passing game you know they're gonna have to find a way to get a little bit more pressure because JJ Watt has not been able to show that pressure consistently on Cam Newton nor has Jadeveon Clowney well and that has to do with how much they've been on the field here in the second half they are at least in the second quarter they haven't been well rested and you look at the amount of snaps and the amount of reps that they had that's why they were sluggish there towards the end of this half for the end of the first half Houston gets the ball first in the second half Quentin dumps his deep zone from 20yard line and we go down to gaming well great you guys just said it we think Ryan Mallett had a tough first half I certainly wouldn't want to be him in the second half Ron Rivera just told me they didn't get after the Texas quarterback as much as they would have wanted to in this game as far as the Panthers offense tempo and pacing is going to be key Rivera agreed that was a really brutal start to the game just for Cam Newton to get going so it will be key for them speed and Cam Newton's gonna lead them to this win thanks Jamie and you know we had the question all set for Bill O'Brien before he even settled into his seat when he met with us if Ryan Mallett is not the answer do you go back to Brian Hoyer coked out across the 32 about the 33 and to followup on that gray coach O'Brien said listen this is Ryan Mallett steam at this point in time now he can't say how long it's going to be but he knew he wasn't gonna give him a short lease for this game he wants to say you see him for an extended period of time and so look for him to lick who ride him out to be in here the rest of the way nothing there for bull he's racked up by the rookie linebacker Shaq Thompson first half numbers favoring the Panthers as you would expect the struggles offensively for the Houston Texans come on highlighted there is a number of penalties that's why it's hard to get any kind of rhythm for either of these all offenses the number of penalties and then there been injuries on both sides as well that's why the sun's going second and ten now at Chloe and he's got a man across the 40 and close to a first down that's DeAndre Hopkins that is a first down well you can see the tempo that the Texans are attempting to get into with that first completion of this Drive they got up to the ball they snap the ball quickly and now they're continuing to go into snow huddle not necessarily a 2minute type of tempo but they're going with the no huddle just to increase the tempo I'm getting some kind of rhythm immediately after making the catch is Alfred blue Thomas Davis with the hit word from the Houston Texans by the way is that the injured offensive lineman Jeff Adams will not return second and seven when they give me across midfield into Carolina territory to the 48 dozen be furred entombed Charles Johnson with the stop as you look at the Texans firsthalf possessions and just not a whole lot to show on offense today well we just saw help her group blue carried on that last play and that's the biggest game he's had all day five yards he's only got four carries for six yards so they need to get the run game going to take some of this pressure off of Ryan Mallett third and two two yards keep the drive alive from Allen and the Houston Texans now I'm throwing and out of the backfield onehanded grab by crisp bolt and he got the first down fine fine job by Polk Tillman and Harper hitting him not long after he pulled it in won't poke does a tremendous job of this onehanded cats securing the football the spot that they've been giving him is enough for a first down that's a catch under perfect new set of downs from mallet at the Carolina 45 this is pull both is a fourthyear running back out of the University of Washington and it's been it's been running back by committee since the loss of Arian Foster what has been and really blue is your main running back that you like to use in first house but now that they've gone to this no huddle spreading and that is complete to the 26yard line the Cecil Shorts the third and for all of his troubles today Ryan Mallett stuck that one in their wellness this entire Drive it's about giving your quarterback in rhythm and firing in there and he he just seems much more confident right now as he's stepping into his throws the first that there was a lot of throwing off his back foot loading with pressure in his face but so far in his five he's kept very consistent on first down this is take again and pulled inside the 25 to about the 24 and a half maybe 2 23 yard line and by getting this running game going you also take some of the pressure off of the offensive line it's a matter of the guys up front for Carolina we're really getting after the quarterback getting after Ryan Mallett the first half you can find some balance that takes that got away with absolutely for diverse pounds on this Drive already this is beyond great Hopkins and Hopkins at the 15 if you see what they've done different describe Greg you see how that getting the ball out of his hands quickly all the throws have been underneath there haven't been very many throw there when there was a one throw earlier that was up the field but most of these throws have been under that 7 8 yard range get the ball out of your hands quickly get the ball on target this has been a nice Drive for the Texans thing to open up the second half first time into the red zone today on the quick slant DeAndre Hopkins inside the 10 to the ceremony what's these quick pops doing a quarterback's percentage good it is and it's you know it's getting getting into that tempo I keep saying tempo rhythm tempo rhythm and that's something the ballot is never able to get into the first out on second and team this is pork a yard on the play courtesy of Thomas Davis so mallet and the Texans now looking at a third and two they can get a first down without getting a touchdown Alfred lose in the backfield with mouth hauling the flu in the back get up as they call a quick timeout here he started to say I was gonna say with blue in the backfield I would think more of a playaction pass because the Carolina's gonna think with blue in there there's gonna be a run inside the tackles so give that playaction pass bring those guys in there and then you had the four guys out wide to where you could get a rubber out in see Bill O'Brien the head coach there off to the right I thought he was an absolute delight to talk to during our meeting he was great you know you never really know for us that's the first time getting to talk to Coach O'Brien and we didn't really it you know as you go into those production meetings you know how forthcoming are they going to be and he was very open with us very honest especially about the quarterback situation and what the thought process was going into making that change this week and some of his thoughts of course about the defense and his thoughts about hard knocks he was very open about that and it was it was a nice soft living there definitely one Houston had 93 total yards in the first half 73 on this Drive third and 2 I still look for a while to the outside now end zone then he come down it has ruled a touchdown Garrett Graham we'll see if that holds up but what a catch by Graham at the back of the end zone Welling from here it certainly does look like a cat's Graham putting the one hand up and being able to bring it in and look from up here to get both feet in you have to finish the catch there's one foot down two foot down two feet down in bounds it depends on when he secures the ball so he secures it right there the one foot is on the ground the second foots on the ground and ECB finishes the catch yeah he did the ball stays secure there's no movement of the ball as he hits the the upright or not the upright by the goalpost mallet with the touchdown pass Graham with his first touchdown catch and the extra point is good 829 to play an impressive drive by mallet and the Texans and we have a 1010 tie here in Carolina you're watching the NFL on CBS this telecast is copyrighted by the NFL for the private use of our audience any other use of this telecast or any pictures descriptions are accounts of the game without the NFL's consent is prohibited Garrett Graham's first catch of the season is a seven yard touchdown reception one badly needed by the Houston Texans Ryan Mallett seven out of seven on that drive as Houston pulls even at 10 apiece 829 to play here in the third quarter and this will not be returned it'll sail through the end zone the touch back and Cam Newton in the offense will begin the 20 yard line it was Ryan Mallett to Garrett Graham dandy catches back at the end zone we're back to Charlotte epidemic that's Charlotte North Carolina skyline is easy on the eyes isn't it and great weather go with it damn Newton at you to Jonathan Stewart and Houston defense can stand tall now as they pull even a 10 take a look at the first half possessions for the Carolina Panthers there wasn't a whole lot there offensively to show to shout about either no they were slow coming out of the gate that's for sure and coach Rivera told us that he was looking for a faster start that didn't happen but they did get things going in the second quarter a little bit and were able to make some awesome scoring ground second eight deep drop from Newton neatly on the run sliding across the 30 for a first down okay we we had to we had to compliment him on that sliding because the coaches have been after him to do a little more that well that's not something he really likes to do he will fork with the person coming off the edge wat losing contain on the outside and you can see Cam Newton taking the slide there and giving us a little first down signal six carries for 47 yards rushing yogi over the liver incomplete fans want to fall against quittin Dems covering Greg Olson let's go down to Jamie well I think Greg it's time to reveal to the world that Cam Newton is a pescetarian going on for years he doesn't eat meat he only eats fish he told us yesterday that the thing he misses most is Fried Chicken but he doesn't really do it for dietary reasons it's more of a mind over matter challenge so pretty interesting his mercury levels he admittedly said are very high I had no idea what a puss he said I'm a pescetarian I wanted to say I'm so sorry he has no idea okay thanks Jamie second and ten new employee over shooting Devin Funchess the man coming across in third and ten we've since found out that means that they need anything except fish and a lot of it yeah you know it was it was pretty amazing you know he said he still has a sweet tooth you know he'll eat some of the not necessarily good things for anybody stays away from meat and chicken and it's all about this one Jamie touched on it perfectly it's just it's more of a discipline they're not necessarily because he wants them a certain type of diet it's just to prove himself he has that discipline Newton with time throwing his side of the field incomplete but here is the penalty marker and this looks like it's gonna go against Jonathan Joseph illegal contact defense over twenty four to five yard penalty automatic push down Ted Ginn is going to come up and he's just running an out route but I want you to watch right here Joseph he's gonna easily gonna reach that right arm out right when Jen tries to make the cut he reaches that right arm out and wraps it around his waist and that's what the official sees and why the flag was thrown so new set of downs for Cam Newton and Newton gonna keep it on the right side breaking tackles midfield and out of bounds at about the 45 yard line it is just with the read ops and he's going to be reading it right off of outside linebacker John Simon we talked to the Texans how do you tackle Cam Newton is there certain when you go for his legs do you stay up high do you tackle is arms what is it you want to try and do and they said well the first thing you need to do is is you need to try and wrap his arms because you don't want to continue to play and throw the ball upfield of your the hanging around his arms that time signage is too high not able to bring him down Kennedy shake some off when you're 65 to 45 you got to bring him down more than that 19 yard run is the longest for anyone today going over the middle tip intercepted as a penalty marker flies in the secondary Ronnie Moore has the ball but let's check the fly they're gonna get dimps against Olson but because that ball was tipped it won't be a pass interference now if they call it holding then the play could stand prior the past holding defense first down watch dips he's going to be man the man on Olson here they are right here in your side screen Watchmen and follow him across the field you'll see him grab him you see the jersey extend that official that's in the back he's a good 30 yards 25 yards away from it as soon as he sees the Jersey extend the flags coming out every time so the turnover goes up and smoke for the tech teams trying to bounce it outside and dives for a couple of yards we even even in pregame worlds you look at the sheer size of Cam Newton you know Ron Rivera was a pretty good linebacker in his day for the Chicago Bears and I asked him he's he's ever imagined a quarterback that big running at him and he just kind of rolled his eyes well the funny story told us how many people come up to him and sat it I didn't realize you were this big he's because you're standing next to came all the time it has such a large man he's a tough you know it makes him look small so and Ron's shared with the fact the guy camp size would have played a different position when you appointed great grab at the 30yard line by Greg Wilson watch Cam Newton as he stands in the pocket it takes guts to play quarterback in the National Football League and he stands in here and makes this throw right as he's getting hit and taken to the ground puts an accurate throw is a king dent that was putting the pressure on Cam Newton but with that arm strength and obviously Olson with his hand strength bringing the catch in five catches 43 yards for Wilson today knew at that time as he thought about running it up the middle by JJ Watt and JJ doing a the Cam Newton bit nice little pop and then JJ with the pose first down the other way he's always creative with it he's got the numbers to do that play clock down to five Stewart snow inside the 25 twisting his way to the 21 yard line it be third and about three and he just freezes Kevin Johnson who comes up for the tackle you'll see him as he approaches the screen Stewart here getting to the second level watch 30 just get froze in there neatly under center third and three don't play of this Drive maybe throw incomplete inside the 20 and that looks to be enough for a first down 10 in junior coming across the middle Cam Newton showing a lot of patience on a lot of these completions and you got to give credit to the offensive line I know he took us out a little bit earlier but that time Texans were bringing heat to try and keep the first down from happening they picked up they picked up the pressure and allow Cam Newton step in and take in with the with the hit or with the cats as the hit was taking place securing that cuts for the first time under three minutes to play here in the third katako inside the 15 to 14 this Carolina team won its second straight NFC South championship last year with a 7 8 and 1 record and had to come on with a rush at the end of the season to do it only amazing thing about it is they had to go on the road for the playoffs and win a playoff game after after having that losing record but this is exactly at Carolina need if they need the answer the Texas scoring drive to open up this half with a long drive of their own incomplete the Newton was lucky that Jonathan Joseph was dialed in on Mike Tolbert and was coming up to try and secure the tackle and not paying attention to the ball because this could have been a pic going the other way ball comes out a little bit high towards Tolbert you'll see Tolbert coming out into the flat here as a quarterback does your life pass in front of you when that happens it's one of those ones you release the ball and you and you wish you had a string on it there's some of those who dismiss a task and defend it back birthday and they'll take a timeout 2:09 to play in the third 1010 with Carolina knocking on the door the view from on high with 209 to play here in the third quarter third and six for Cam Newton and the Carolina offense Newton to go fourth inside the 10 pushed down in Lowell at the 6 yard line to Tobin Tolbert's gonna do a fake cross you can come out here and then reverse back out that way and that's really what freezes the linebacker in terms of coverage creating that separation on Justin toggle everybody pointing fingers on the offensive line cleat Blakeman we'll get the last point neutral zone infraction defense that's Jadeveon Clowney half the distance we'll put the ball just inside the three finally lined up right here forcing goal Gregg he really was Superman this is a call quarterback draw when he goes airborne and rahim or not a prayer to stop it you know with the extra point it is good 104 to play in the third quarter and the Panthers answering right back with a touchdown to grab the 17 Carolina comes right back to grab a 1710 lead on Houston led by Cam Newton we have 64 seconds to play here in the third quarter Quinton Demps deep for the kick and will not get a chance to run this one back it'll come out to the 20yard line Cam Newton prior to the game out on the field in his Superman shoes this Superman tshirt come game time he gets airborne over rocky Moore and the only Superman would come up smile how's that for an accomplishment who knew the great Otto Graham around the football that much most rushing touchdowns by a quarterback in the first 63 games of a career and still going with the way they made that last drive and inserted the Texans Russ to those guys are pretty much a good Chandler worthy worthy 25 30 Cal across the 32 about the 33 reminder tomorrow here on CBS the geniuses from last season's hit drama are back don't miss the season premiere of scorpion tomorrow at 9:00 8:00 central only CBS last 40 seconds of the third quarter after that last drive and touchdown Trent lots and lots of congratulations for the Carolina offensive line coming off the field well and rightfully so they had to come back and answer the Texans drive after they open up the third quarter with a long 80yard Drive and Carolina going back out and doing the same thing so it was it was a good answer good test for the for the offensive lineman of Carolina as you mentioned and now it's up to the Texans after having not having much offense the first not have to see quite a bit here in the third quarter fast to the outside that is completely Cecil Shorts the third and he is out of bounds about a yard short of a first down as time expires here in the third quarter we've played three in Charlotte 1710 Panthers we're back after this message and a word from your local station you're watching the NFL on CBS with our producer Bob moms Bock our director Suzanne Smith Greg Gumbel Trent Green Jamie doll the rest of our crew here in Charlotte on the data began with NBA MVP Steph Steph Curry pounding the drum getting the honorary honors his honors our honorary Carolina the 17th and lead as we start the fourth see now I'm gonna think about honorary honors all the way home let's give it about you Brian mellitus straight past what to do as we begin the fourth that's great second and ten Holt out of the backfield well and under press Ramallah didn't have time to hang on to that ball and see how the play developed he had to get rid of the ball quickly he was trying to anticipate had to release it early and really didn't have much stance on that point so junior is deep and he will fair catch this one at 17 yard so that's where Carolina will start and going back to Steph Curry reigning NBA MVP grew up playing high school ball nearby Charlotte Christian won three conference titles are an allstate honors and returned to the area with a championship trophy this week stopping by Davidson College on Thursday and Charlotte Christian on Friday I bet you that trophy gets you a lot of access he's a heck of a player heck of a person he tremendous for the community and really happy for him the success that he's had he's kind of good without a doubt that's for sure I just can't get a lot of quickens reading soon they interest you to know I have an equally quick release but the ball is nowhere near as accurate there's Dell curry his dad was a really good shooter in his day that's perfect timing catching him flossing as these lots in the game but good hygiene is never out of style I guess welcome to television second date it's in the intended receiver it'll be third and eight when that with ball was tipped that was something we we saw a lot of in the first quarter when there was plenty of pressure applied to Cam Newton and his arm was either being hit or balls were being tipped at the line of scrimmage that time Ivan Olson down the middle of the field but because of that tip not allowed to get to him from the start of this game to now try and it feels like the running game has just been an afterthought yeah cam cams hadn't had some effective runs but it's it's been in big chunks and just not a real consistent steady regular meter to deliver diving for the first down and got it out to the 27 yard line when you have to remember when a quarterback is running and he goes headfirst he's just like a regular runner that it's where it's where he's touched is where the ball is down if you go feet first and you slide then it's where the ball is when your feet begin the slides so by going headfirst he's able to pick up the first down Newton with 77 rushing yards compared to 61 in the entire Newton the throw on first down had it batted at the line and Jadeveon Clowney get credit for that one Jadeveon plane playing once again only 27 miles from his hometown coming off the edge he's able to get a hand on this ball you talk about the number of family and friends and were gonna be in attendance and he always plays inspired football but he had a little something extra today being in front of the hometown people to the outside that was the 30th snap played today by Jadeveon Clowney he played 30 last week little Brian indicated that he could get more this week well he was very clear when he had a chance to talk to him he wants to play as many snaps as they'll give him he it's the Texans that are that are monitoring things as you see his family here there's his mom you know guys from the South Carolina area it groups in 25 and 30 35 people visiting today Newton under pressure trying to spit away escapes once a helmet goes rolling out and he's down inside the 15yard line any Pleasant Quinton Demps see they bring seven men in pretend seven men with the rush can't block everybody and Pleasants the first one to get after him helmet comes flying off before Demps comes and cleans it up telling you there's something about those Texans helmet they just don't want to stay on this is mumphrey trying to turn the corner back to about the 45 yard line 11:46 to play here in the fourth quarter superstars on both sides of the ball and right now Cam Newton his guys for the one touchdown leave mean to win their first of the season Carolina looking to go to a No under center and a straight drop and for all and under through it intended for Cecil Shorts our reminder coming up the subway postgame show JB in the game back in New York alone wiliest NFL scores and highlights coming up on the subway postgame show see the Texans take advantage of this good field position just poke me back for you on suckling 10 far side of the panel everybody intended for Hopkins covered closely by Josh Norman they have noticed about Josh Norman today Greg is he has a tendency to look back at the quarterback he talked about trying to focus on the quarterback him even that time has the plays going down the sideline he he faces back squares up and tries to jump that's the second or third time today we've seen him do that so 13:10 over the middle and a bullet in and out of the is that a completion if it's a completion that's a fumble Josh Norman covering they're going to talk about it when you have to remember the rule here not only it is rule to catch and a fumble you have to have both feet down you have to have the ball secure and you have to be making a football move there's the catch one to Thomas Davis what they get forcing the fumble welcome back Clete Blakeman about ready to make his announcement question is if Cecil Shorts the third made a football move with the ball after review the play the receiver cannot maintain control the ball therefore it is incomplete pass brings up fourth down the previous spot please put 11 minutes 31 seconds 11 31 on the game clock let's go to Mike Erie in New York Mike hey Greg this here is a little different than last year a receiver has had control check two feet down check but then have the ball long enough to become a runner to be able to award off an opponent or avoid contact there were no more steps after that second step the ball skipped out incomplete alright Mike thank you very much and the pump is going to be down just inside the 20 yard line so with 1122 to play in the Carolina offense back onto the field and a reminder next Sunday the NFL on CBS brings a doubleheader action Trent and Jamie and I will be in st. Louis for the Steelers and the Rams the Chargers will take on the Vikings then in Game two the Bears and Seahawks take center stage all begins with the team that will take you all the way to Super Bowl 50 kids begin the guys on the NFL today first down at the 20 yard this is Jonathan Stewart left side we lose yardage back 17 yard line Vincent willfulness and Whitney merciless with the hit well you have to give Carolina credit for attempting to stick with the run you meant you mentioned earlier gray the Cam Newton is leading them in rushing with 77 yards with Johnathan Stewart now as 13 carries for only 50 yards as the Texans defense tries to keep them one onedimensional on second and 11 Stewart and Stewart to about the 22 mentioned Vince Wilfork on that last play it's strange to see Vincent anything but a New England uniform yeah there certain players he just he recognizes as one type of uniform and Vince was the anchor of that New England defense for so long and for many world championships but his a great relationship with Romeo Crennel and when he became a free agent Mike Vrabel was a teammate of his you see right there up in New England it was easy to recruit it down third nation and on the sled trying to break on the football intended for a Derrick Devin Funchess was Kevin Johnson the rookie cornerback from Wake Forest saw it coming you see right here on the outside Johnson reads that all the way but says the big six four receiver out of Michigan but Johnson planted that boot drove on it before fronts eceive indid and was in position to get the interception fourth time today Carolina has gone three and out Keith mumphrey back at his own 22 yard line booming kick that 16 in the right up the middle his monthly just across the 32 about the 32

started in the middle today for Luke Kuechly and comes up with the pick the coaches were raving about a decline just what type of player he was what type of parolee was knowing that he could play multiple positions they had no worry at all about him filling in for Luke Kuechly welcome back vanity to play in the fourth quarter Cam Newton play fake with time go da Kenzo anyway Billy brown is oneonone with Jonathan Joseph on the outside Cam Newton comes off with a heart white fake it's the safeties to fight up here's the combination gives a little nod to the outside to get Joseph's hips turn then takes it inside to the post that is just like they drew it up and we have a soon they're calling for some sideline help for one of the officials that line judge Paul Johnson welcome to the nearest sideline we need little hydration the point attempt is good and with 853 to play in the fourth quarter Carolina stretches its lead to 24 to 10 when the heart play fake you're gonna see temps come up in formation he's going to bite on that fake but you're going to see the route just a nod to the outside with a deep post so as Cam Newton comes off of his hard play pick he sees the safety drop sees Brown with that outside nod so here's the route here the Safety's way behind he has no help over the top Cam Newton puts it in a place and till the ground jumps up catches that out at IIST point so it doesn't allow Jonathan Joseph to come up and make a play and as we've learned over the last couple of season you have to finish the catch to the ground till the ground does finish the kids you know you really have to do some jumping if you're gonna highfive Cam Newton I like the the excitement that he brings at the field he's definitely enjoys playing football you can get get that broom with a Jake Lyons interception set it up through the end zone for the touch one more look at another touchdown pass for Cam Newton today and this one right on the money and then for the fans it's football giveaway day here in Charlotte man you see the smile on his face up by two touchdowns therefore part of you they'll make you smile on that road marker on the near side of the field there is no foul play for a defensive holding pass was in the air at the five time the foul occurred please call legitimate its second down meanwhile Carl Johnson coming back onto the field after being treated on the sidelines a little heat exhaustion good man Carl second and one locks it up as a man open it he hits him dirty inside the 25 is Nate Washington lost his footing thought he had six and couldn't maintain the balance right mallet has time Nate Washington here at the top of your screen Mallett just laying it up over the top so all the way down to the 23 yard line 38 yard pickup here are the Texas knocking on the door mallet over the middle inside the 15yard line to DeAndre Hopkins being down by two scores the defense knows what the Texans are going to do so for this depleted offensive line kind of a patchwork offensive line did they put together here giving mallet twisting these last two pollution Alex stepping up trolling and complete intended for Cecil Shorts 2/3 726 on the block that time Carolina showing like they were going to bring pressure and dropping out into a cover two and dropping back in zone forcing Mallon to try and hit the underneath throw second intent the best just a moment ago inside the 10 to the 8 yard line to Cecil Shorts the third will be down two touchdowns you definitely think this is four down territory here so you have two downs to pick up the first down they need to get it to looks like this around the three yard line so look for a little bit more of the same Bill O'Brien trying to work the inside Bill O'Brien was in four down territory back in the first quarter he was thirtyfour now why for pull out of the backfield and it'll be fourth and four that's just recognizing that the defensive end was peeling off on your running back so he just tried lobbing it out there open the boat can run underneath it so what's been working for Ryan Mel coilette Carolina is going to sew presser but then ultimately drop out into cut so they've got fun find those inside windows that they were on the previous partner that's right and we are gonna get a timeout timeout with 638 remaining Carolina uses its second here in the second half and a reminder coming up the subway postgame show can he be in the guys will have latest scores and highlights coming up on the subway postgame show just a reminder Texans can get a first down at the 3 yard line so based on what they've been doing this drive look for something inside again you're spread things out with movement poke out to the formation sprint him out wide with the three wide reciever look the statement tied into the now other subpoena movement Pickler Aysen and find out if their man the manner zone where he wants to go with this ball quickly pulls it down going to run for it didn't get there for the touchdown now let escape the rush and looked up and had a wide open field a couple of times in this game we've seen one team score and the other team answer well not and that's the one thing you can't get caught up in when you're facing Ryan Mallett you're thinking okay he's not the mobile guy running warriors the mobile guys so let's go mantoman and let's tie everybody up but you don't assign anybody to the quarterback he's not a female it's going to be the mobile guy to run around and nobody has signed the Ryan Mallett there he sees everybody covered and has a window to get it into the end zones mallet engineers an 80yard Drive in just two minutes and 22 seconds and Houston back to within a touchdown again at 24 17 with six and a half to play but what's the combination a receiver so you have three including the tight end Graham here and you have poked out here with DeAndre Hopkins and what happens is with them dropping into their routes you'll watch everybody lock in you got three on two up here you've got four on three down here but this entire part of the middle of the field is wide open as Ryan Mallett steps up and is looking for us that's why no one's open you have three on two and four on three but nobody's assign mallet recognizes that has a window or lane to get it into the end zone seven plays eighty yards and still plenty of time plenty of time timeout situation Houston has two remaining Carolina has won and Fozzy Whittaker will run this one out of the end zone 20 freaks three close to the 30yard line Carlos Thompson with the tackle those of you just joining us number one has had himself a heck of a day trip well here's the touchdown pass early on to Ted Ginn who's on the double move on if Superman gets flipped into the endzone then follows it up with that touchdown pass to Philly brown on their last possession that's not Carolina got to there 24 points a look at the numbers on the day so far meanwhile for Houston a little bit slower going is Ryman now a new starting quarterback has worked his way into a rhythm here in the second half Jonathan Stewart pulls his way close to the 35 yard line well that's important to point out you talk about Ryan Mallett in that first half the Houston Texans had 93 yards of offense at half time in the second half they have 178 yards of offense so you mentioned Malik getting into a little bit of a rhythm and obviously they're getting some points on the board feeling much more comfortable as they've been able to move this ball in the second half and we talked about at the beginning of the day how unusual it is that a head coach would change quarterbacks just one game into the season and not because of injury well in coach O'Brien was able to tell us he said you know what Ryan Mallett got into that fourth quarter against Kansas City gave us a spark and I want to see what he can do I'm not gonna be a quick trigger with him I want to see him ride it out so when things were struggling there in the first half we knew that he was gonna stick out stick it out with mallet for this second half and things have turned around for me he was bombarded all week with that question wasn't he and he was very he was very nice about it he knew we were gonna ask it he knew it eventually come around but he was prepared for it and had the answer that that definitely backed it up 30 now for Newton take the stool new controls it back in my opinon spread Wilson and submit feel 40 35 yard line in the first down 27 yard pickup well the Carolina Panthers are going to do they're going to overload and put an extra offensive lineman to one side and put Olsen Olsen is going to be on the short spot here lined up as a tackle but he's eligible and he's going to sneak out the back Cam Newton's gonna roll out this way you get the defense to draw across you bite them in you feed them in and then Olsen sneaks his way over to that back side and you hit the throw back for the big game Mason had just one catch last week he has six 470 yards today this is Stewart and for those of you just blue just joined us JJ Watt has not been the disrupting force that one would normally expect he's had some plays but he hasn't been the consistent force Carolina has done a nice job mainly double teaming him you'll see him with guards and tackles sometimes tackles with a tight end very rarely do you see a running back on him but they're putting a lot of big bodies on him and trying to wear them down especially in the second half you look at time of possession it's it's been a case where they're trying to wear them out 3:45 to play in the fourth this is catered so back to the line of scrimmage in no more Brian Cushing Whitney merciless combine for the tackle the Texans because of the score because of the situation in the time left they're putting a lot of guys down in the Box putting a lot of defenders near that line of scrimmage see JJ Watt stay 7th straight game with a sack three minutes to play third and nine in a beat down produced in defense pumps ones throwing incomplete inside the 10yard line intended for Olson and covered well down there by Clinton Demps and by Raheem or that's a prime example of the protection in the time the Cam Newton has had most of this afternoon really nowhere for him to put that ball try to try to put it high and on the back shoulder and see volson can't can't get it as the the Panthers good enough to try to pick one area 33 yard organ 0:04 his last three from 50 or more yards going back to last year this man on his way at night of course this one is blocked at the line of scrimmage so look at the field position now that the Houston Texans get with 244 to play and two timeouts it appears that jarred Creek right here number 93 it appears he's the one that's going to get a hand on it you'll see the push he's lined up right next in between will forked and watt new he got a hand on it and now because of that attempt this gives the Texans good field position with 244 to go mallet and company from the 43 bounces off of the shoulders of Chris pulk out of the backfield it'll be second and ten well now and this will be interesting to see what Caroline decides to do defensively do they keep with their four and their three man pressures and try and drop in to cover to keep everything in front of them or do you continue with the pressure bring those linebackers go with some mantoman if you go with what they've been doing they're just gonna rush the floor try and drop guys in coverage and see if mallet can make those after it goes up this is pullpull shakes a tackler in the backfield 45 works his way to the sideline pop continues to move is you'll be walking down at the 47 yard line Thomas Davis with the tackle to 25 to play that time Carolina decided to bring pressure brought pressure from the strong side mallet recognizing to check in to the run away from that pressure now on third downs they cut trying to get the crowd noise into this thirtysix Hopkins of Norman now with a bullet and DeAndre Hopkins wasn't looking got to get a roughing the quarterback it looks like personal foul roughing the passer defense in the 94 at least 15 yards their previous spot first down Houston defensive and Kony Ealy that a perfect design here he's the one coming off the edge he's gonna get the penalty here but they had to disguise a presser so malla thinks he has mantoman you can see Ely takes a couple extra steps as he hits mallet makes no sense you got him off the field bringing up a key fourth down obviously to give a first down the discus the pole hope to the 35 and that takes us under two minutes 156 to play here in Charlotte Houston looking for the time touchdown along with Trent Green and Jamie airdog Greg Gumbel back in Charlotte a game that started sluggishly has turned into a heck of a tussle 24 17 Carolina a minute 56 to play Houston looking for the tying score for course now under pressure and under throws and this pulp was covered out here by AJ climb it'll be third and seven third seven mallet still has to remember with a minute 51 left in this game he still has plenty of area in the middle of the field he can't can just look to the outside it's not like he's down on his own 20yard line he's in good field position here so utilize the space utilize the the open parts of the middle of the field as you approach this tilt down and down seven there is no thought of a field goal here 37 throwing complete meat Washington and Washington at Seabury its forward progress is Martin very close to a first down I couldn't tell you how difficult of a ket's that is by Nate Washington that is a fastball behind him as he's running inside he has to reach behind him and make this Katz they stopped it for a measurement Washington's going to be at the top of the screen and he comes inside incredible cuts reaching back to get it here is the first down line here is where the receiver is Washington trying to get to the ball it appears on that replay short little bit short small fourth and inches but on the replay it looks like a good spot so I don't you know even though it's under two minutes from a spot standpoint I think that was a good location that they mark that ball fourth down you have a patchwork offensive line Gregg you gots three three different three different guys up front because of injuries guys sliding to new positions the success now we're going to have a timeout taken by Houston that is their second so each team down the one turnoff so with a success so with the success of mallet his hat throwing the football that you throw it or do you run it here for the first down Oh on fourth and short guess they're taking another look at this to see if the spot is good he's clearly sort of the line actually I think he's even further away from the line than what they ultimately spotted it it's only going to be a few inches away so where they've had success running the football by spreading people out and then trying to get the run inside so I think you do that again I think you spread everybody out the Carolina decide soon to bring that pressure to put all those guys in there didn't you do one of your rubber outs on the outside if they decide to keep everybody expanded then the Texans are doing opposite they brought in big bodies trying to run the ball this is poke both fighting for first down yardage and he gets it to the 26 yard line a minute 16 a minute 15 to play Carolina 100 Houston on1 looking for win number one on the season just looking for a tie game here right now a bullet to the 20yard line incomplete Cecil Shorts the third you still have time 50 seconds here left in the half you still have one timeout mallet needs to understand you can utilize the middle of the field like you did on that last completion second in four throwing it far side suit away stops the clock with 32 seconds to play and it'll be a 34 smart decision stopping the clock throwing the ball away realizing there's pressure coming up the pocket on third down now with 30 seconds you need to continue to put the ball in the air so you can still utilize the middle of the field so because you're close to the end zone you utilize the middle of the field you can get everybody up and spike the ball you don't have to burn the time out fit these in bounds it's different than having the full field where you have to stretch because everybody's condensed and close together you can still get a ball in bounds get the first down and spike it and save that time timeout fall by Carolina Carolina takes third and final time though this is a 30second timeout so Carolina is out of timeouts now would you feel good running the football here I wouldn't I would continue to throw it I think you spread them out again you see what they're going to do what what Carolina has shown is they bring their safeties down or one of the two safeties to act like they're going to bring pressure and then they bail them out so that they have helped over the top don't give up the big plays they're trying to disguise something I think you continue to work the middle of the field you only need four yards to get the first down so go up get the inside receivers to clear out in the middle get your outside guys that comes rubbing underneath you pick up the first down get down you can spike the ball that will give you around 20 seconds with a timeout left first down the 12 yard line third and four going for the endzone we have a flag on the north side of the field it was Ely that was offsides he got leaning on that snap count and if mallet did realize that you can just throw a jump ball in the end zone because it doesn't matter you've got a free play if it is on Carolina then its first down for Houston offside defense number 94 play was in the neutrals or the snap fiveyard penalty yardage is enough for a first down Ely once again making the mistake he had the roughing the passer earlier to keep this drive going now getting caught with the hard count giving him the first down just inside the 15yard line 27 seconds on the clock throwing for the end zone incomplete he had a man running free at the goal line that was Nate Washington you know Greg you did have a man running free Bay didn't have time there was there's the defender got free on the inside even though Washington came free up the middle you'll see Washington he gets free up the middle but mallets going to get presser coming up the middle he doesn't have time to sit there and wait to see which direction Washington's going to go had to get the ball in his hands his smart decision on his part save the yardage save the time second and ten pressure going down tried to throw it away says it's an incomplete pass what are the official said clock continues to move and now stopped with nine seconds to play well here's the problem if it even if it is an incomplete pass it's going to be intentional grounding so that's that's the mistake that mallet makes on this is I know he doesn't want to go down with the ball but go down with the ball use the timeout and then it gives yourself some time the Texans want an incompletion the Panthers want an intentional grounding that's the first indicator that it might be intentional grounding as he goes over to talk to Bill O'Brien so Bill O'Brien is talking it off the clock clock continued to move even while the players were on the ground but you know it's a different situation trend if they throw the flag the clock stops then but if you wait to throw the flag there's a delay and a loss of time on the clock won't you have to remember the new rule now is you can go to replay to check the end of half an end of games you can check the clock with the replay system here's Clete okay here's the situation the ruling on the field is an intentional grounding offense by the quarterback that's a tenyard penalty from the previous spot plus the loss of down which will bring up third down also this situation requires a ten second law save the ten seconds at the time the class was incomplete there were 12 seconds on the game clock so please put 12 seconds on the game clock so that timeout that Houston had come in comes in very handy now at throwing the ball away and watch the game clock on the left side so here's the game clock here's mallet about to go down so they want the game clock reset the could be been reset at 16 right so now cleats coming over to take a look at the the replay system remember that's a new new rule with the replay system this years you can review the the clock at the enhance and end of games ending over time bring in Mike carry Mike please blink and get that right yes about the clock yes yes so the rule is actually that if the clock runs out they can fix it and replay what happened in this case most likely was all seven officials were on the field or watching the clock one of the officials saw that it was an incomplete pass looked up and saw what the time was at that point he wind communicated that with the referee and then they reset that's my opinion of what happened all right Mike and the clock should stop right when the ball hits the ground and somebody must have seen that and it looked to us that that would back the club will clock up to around 15 or 16 seconds remaining it might help but when the official looks up and sees it he sees only what he sees on the clock and in this case it looks like 12th look on that is that or is that not correctable in review no the only clock situation death renewable is if the clock ran to zero then they can go back and put time on the clock unless of course there was a reversal on the play okay Mike thank you sir meanwhile as this game trudges on to can you be your own doubleheader games you know I understand what Mike is saying I understand what the the letter of the law is in terms of the rule the problem is is when the ball is incomplete the clock is ticking from 17 to 16 so it's 16 when the ball hits the ground so the official that's in charge of that that mike says is part of the crew that when the ball is incomplete that's his job to look up the clock he waits for seconds until he looks up and sees the clock in 12 seconds so there is a four second discrepancy between when the ball hit the ground and when the official is now claiming that the the incompletion is at play so it'll be interesting to see what here comes clean away from the replay booth and what was ultimately determined 10 penalties on each side today there's cleat bleakman after reviewing the play the ruling on the field stands is called on the field in addition the batch is confirmed with me at the time the pass was incomplete there were 17 seconds on the game clock to please put 17 seconds on the game clock rings up there down so here's the play one more time you see the game plot on the Left mallet gets rid of the ball it falls incomplete and 17 seconds on the clock meanwhile mallet is looking at a third and 22 with no timeouts remaining Houston needs the five yard line for a first down you there have to throw this ball so the receiver can get out of bounds or you have to throw it into the end zone I don't know if you can get to ball snap this side and poke out about short of the 20 yard line 13 on the clock well if you get out of bounds you have time for two more plays but it is fourth down so they're gonna have to take a shot into the enzone fourth and 16 for Houston now loose looking throwing end zone ever saw zone intended for DeAndre Hopkins you see Carolyn only rushing for dropping seven in two covers and everybody is pretty much at the goal line or behind it Mallett on the run comes close to passing the line of scrimmage Cam Newton overexcited with me to be complacent because he goes crazy with the wind with that Carolina holds on for its second win in two outings 24 17 over Houston meanwhile the Houston Texans fall to Owen and Ryan mallets first start as a Texan fall short yeah valiant effort here in the second half you know they came out in the start of the third quarter after halftime and put together a nice 80 80 yard drive it's just Cam Newton came up with some bigger plays when needed Carolina Panthers have now won six straight regular season games going back to last season take a look at that fourth down play one more time we oughta remind you the final score 24:17 coming up next the subway postgame show for trek and Jamie Greg Gumbel so long from Charlotte you've been watching the NFL on CBS the home of Super Bowl 50 it's the subway postgame show you'll see plenty of this you",

  "transcript": "Bill O'Brien of the Houston Texans arrived here in Miami just one game off the pace hard to believe and for Jacksonville a winner earlier today diamond London them has just gone final as they defeated the Buffalo Bills 34 to 31 what a moment for Dan Campbell now the youngest head coach in the NFL on an interim basis it's taking over a couple of weeks ago for Joe Philbin as you see where Miami sits right now in the basement of the AFC East Speer Adidas and Wilcox rest of our CBS crew interesting two teams Samba that have underachieved to this point both road wins last week which team validates what they did seven days ago well I think that's the key they're gonna come armed with their defensive stars JJ Watt for the Houston Texans and Dominic ensue and Cameron Wake for the Miami Dolphins the goal is going to be to shut down the opponent's running game and then put pressure on the quarterback Miami wanting the toss electing to defer and so the Texans will receive the Wookiee kicker and drew points on to put it away is hopefully one of the wide receivers for Bill O'Brien we'll take it on atbats from just outside his end zone he has a couple of Steve's across the 32 or pounds just past the 40 excellent return for mumphrey of 43 yards and that brings us to Brian Hoyer you see his numbers took the job away from Ryan Mallett couple of weeks ago in Indianapolis Malik pulling himself broke the cardinal rule never take yourself out of the game and employer's never looked at ya he'd never heard of the story of Wally good right gave birth to new Garrett and the rest is history lawyer last Sunday excellent thirtysix pass attempts 15 of which worked on in the direction of the LA Hopkins the budding superstar first Tana hoy is gonna throw has a man up the scene it is things no surprise there overthrew him as for year it was under heavy the rest all kinds of movement today with some injuries Blanton Brooks have scratched out with a toe injury Derrick Newton moving over to that right guard position backs and receivers we've been talking about the entree Hopkins four straight games of a hundred yards receiving to tie a franchise record a look saw man dead atomic ensue yeah Donnell consumed means business and guess what Dan Campbell told us he sat down we talked I listen and now we're going to give him ownership about his deepest blaze they're coming out with that energy we saw from there one week ago Arian Foster blowing up with a backfield a loss of two Cameron wake all four of his sex last week came in the second quarter of that team hard to believe called Lisi entering the day second in tackles on the team in Jamar Taylor today making a start as Bryce McCain is out for display that me already third and long this is what Brian Hoyer told me yesterday he the situation they want to avoid next up Betty down by the way and so the trend continues for the Texans one of two teams in the league that has not scored a point on their opening drive at all this season yeah it's gonna be about which defensive line can dominate get penetration and put pressure on the opposing quarterback as we said we know the Dolphins are well armed to do that they're now starting to play with the intensity and energy needed to play at a high level the defense that has been so maligned here doesn't follow the defensive coordinator fired this days after Chaco Canyon were sent to the exits here as Jarvis Landry has nowhere to go dumped down after a very minimal return of 70 and so not ideal field position for Ryan Tannehill who's throwing multiple picks in each of his last three games but finally last Sunday in Psalm had started to look like the Tannehill they expected at the start of the year yeah and he's gonna have his work cut out today remember in his first career start going up against JJ watney's Houston Texans down in Houston JJ Watt batted a number of his balls couple of more intercepted was a miserable day for Tannehill turned out to launch a career a great one in JJ Watt sant\u00e9 Hill has worked when the jar deed has snaps this season from the gun on first attempt it's like that's Lamar Miller out of the backfield tackled right after the catch by Brian Cushing the seventh year linebacker out of UFC Billy Turner making his second straight start at that right guard position taking Jamil Douglass's spot Jarvis Landry shot out of the gates but his production has slipped a bit over the last couple of weeks Tannehill said that they have made it a point to get Landry more involved here beginning this afternoon against the Texans second and nine on the 13th and a kick strike this is NaN tree parks at an Atlanta so pages in the they able to break the tackle and work his way close to that first down marker for Miami defensive starters JJ Watt headlines this group twotime NFL Defensive Player of the Year with no sex over the last two games hasn't got three straight without a sec since 2013 to Debbie on cloudy back miss last week's game with an ankle injury only the 10th game of his career by the way with all the games that he's missed first down on the LAN Xang tension run so first intended just outside the 20 the grabbed it first Lamar Miller crosses the 35 and another first deadline is Miller picks up 13 yeah they'd like to come with this reverse action what it does in the holes the backside of the defense see they're able to split it and you can see today beyond cloudy Holly gets a hand on him but he was forced to hold on that reverse just in case they gave the ball to kitty steel so they've been very creative have the Miami Dolphins in terms of their ability to run the ball last week they ran it on seven of their first 11 plays and now they're getting it going here too that you see the run play breakdown guys miss little Juke step to the 40 all the talk Solomon about you know how they went back to the running game we spoke with Dan Campbell talked to Ryan Tannehill and said look this is how we wanted to play all season but they had issues with falling behind early in games last week the first time they were able to stick to the run yeah and Dan Campbell doesn't want to get away from it even on these short throws to Jarvis Landry they look at those essentially as a run play getting the ball on the perimeter they're gonna get the ball on his hands a lot second and five penalty marker thrown Miller's gonna run for the first down we'll see what the call is run out of bounds by AJ Bouvier on an eight yard run by Miller as we wait the call from our referee John Hussey besides number 90 defense penalty is declined result of the play of the first Ally it's against cloudy hard to believe some of the kid who took first overall last year has only played in ten games so far in his career but we asked Bill O'Brien about where clowny is in his development and he said he's real close he's played very well yeah when you put the tape on there are moments where the Davion clowning really flashes and I think he's going to be a special player in this league he just needs more experience more opportunities and he's got to be able to stay healthy to stay on the field he could be an impact player that's Jarvis Landry and motion behind the line of scrimmage first intended of crossing wrap over the middle to sharpies 53 yards from my antenna Hill he's working oneonone against the rookie this is Ken against Kevin Johnson and it's just a real nice throw this is what they want the quick slant routes gonna come here and then the safety doesn't help hey I'm a single high safety if you've got to be able to at least make the tackle here but you can see defenders run into one another and how about Matthews has really been a breakout player for this offense they've struggled at times but he's has been one of their most consistent players fourth touchdown catch you to season from Matthews who is just want dueled in the off season that story of him driving to the team facility the night of the draft after he learned that they had selected Devante Parker out of Louisville as fair trade and he enters the day as their team leader in receiving yards and touchdowns as he builds on those numbers 53 yards by catching on from Tannehill on CB s longest pass of the season completed by Ryan Tannehill as rishard Matthews goes 53 yards for his fourth receiving touchdown of the season Zama we knew that secondary for the Texans is banged up Kevin Johnson the rookie making the start as a Blaine Jackson out today due to injury secondary right at the start there's Frank's boobs that kick through the end zone 7a nothing Miami you're watching the NFL on CBS what a world one couple of weeks it's been for Dan Campbell the 39 year old interim head coach of the Dolphins question mark they were asked him this week after the emotional win was this success sustainable so far a good start what a career he had solid tight end four different teams started his career in 1999 you see one of nine current head coaches who have played in the NFL and Samet not hard to see why his players say he's so easy to relate to and sit across the table from him he looks like it still strap it on in play this is Arian Foster and coach tenant of minimal pickup as he crosses to 20 yeah Dan Campbell I love the fact that he's really tried to keep it simple what he wanted to do in his players infuse the practice in preparation with competition oneonone competition while the rest of the team watches and he said it really has made a difference in terms of their attitude their intensity overall physically Campbell has launched a good start both his offensive defensive edicts to this point as lawyer whoops under center on second and nine the diptych foster at miami defensive front able to get another push call him lease he lead the charge tarik Shelby right behind him this team is now getting after they play fast and physical on the defensive side of the ball last week they came out and Rashad gels the starting safety he delivered a lip that really galvanized this team look at this it was clean they walked the line it's a tight line they don't want to draw penalties but he talked about it that you know Dan cam was really asked him to play fast free and physical and it's made a huge difference it's just the way they're playing on both sides of the ball Lauren and 13 Hoyer is going to sling it far side of the field it's incomplete intended for the rookie out of Arizona State jaelen strong Jamar Taylor making his fourth career start today for Bryce McKean on the coverage and there you see Taylor making a play this is some of the I think the energy the tempo that we're witnessing here today Spiro you and I were here for their home opener against Buffalo that's that's not what we saw we saw a team that was very lethargic that was just kind of going through the paces right now they're playing up in the bit with great energy in infant what a damn Campbell's exroommate's at Texas A&amp;M on for his first punted goes 55 yards seven to nothing Miami the wait is over the world premiere of Supergirl just one day away be sure to see what everyone will be talking about Supergirl premieres tomorrow after a new Big Bang Theory only CBS our Supergirl here in Miami slightly more buff shall we say eclectic looking crowd here in Miami first intense seven to nothing balconies first and ten that's Lamar Miller there so far they have kept Tannehill in rhythm solving those quick passes to his target stare get the ball out very quickly under two seconds and throwing on the perimeter of the defense with JJ Watt can't bat down those balls getting it to the outside getting rid of it quickly under two seconds allowing the play makers to create yards after the catch but a Dan Campbell tell us yesterday I don't not want my quarterback getting his jersey dirty in the first quarter no hits on our quarterback early so far has gotten his wish seven of ten with a quick StreetPass this is Landry nangi breaking a number of tackles already on his first couple of catches had a first down at reception on their first drive and it's right at the marker this time as he picks up nine plus you can't help but like Jarvis Landry look at this he's or he's like a running back but yet he's a receiver if he creates yards after the catch he breaks tackles we saw him do that on that reverse run one week ago he said that at LSU he learned to play just about every single position and they're using him because he can play a number of different positions on this often third and short this is Jonas Gray needed the 38 for the first nine I don't believe he got it as that Houston defense not fooled JJ Watt among the tacklers and it looks like the chains crew will come onto the field JJ Watt made an excellent play there he plays hard he practice hard they can look at this look how he beats and defeats the block spins out of it to make that tackle it because he Brian Cushing getting at the feet of the running back as well alright so the chains crew will not come onto the field officials say he was short so on fourth down the punt team will come onto the field matt dar they're lucky punter out of Tennessee will punt for the first time today keep monk from standing back deep inside his own town spiraling kick takes a dolphin's bounce minutes down just inside the 10 so a 53yard punt seven to nothing miami on CBS Oh JJ what making the young kids stay here in Miami we asked what yesterday what motivates him to play such a high emotional level and he paused and he said every week he envisions that someone is in a stadium that has never watched him play and said that's all he needs to get himself ready to go every Sunday he said there's a megastar in the NFL that first down pass intended for Hopkins is incomplete and so far lawyer has been unable to connect with his favorite target yeah and so far he's got to really get going he's got to get something going he's trying to get it to his numberone target remember DeAndre Hopkins the number one targeted receiver in the National Football League he averages 11 targets again where they're trying to get the ball in his hand he has produced now you know he's going to draw a lot of attention today from this dolphins deeper boil in second attempt goes Drew's reads and completes to foster over the middle this is their third offensive possession they've gone three and out twice as they'll face a third and three coming up the Dolphins come in they understand Bill O'Brien Tony they're gonna try to take away Arian Foster they're gonna try to take away DeAndre Hopkins but those two players have been productive and you know Arian Foster continues to just get better after something that growing injury during the preseason he looked good in last week's game Boyan third and three airs it out neo side of the field incomplete appeared to be some inadvertent contact as hopkins tangled up with Brent Grimes who by the way is also playing banged up today still not full strength after he sprained and me against Jets back in week four before that by Grimes's did a good job of cutting him off look at that Grimes says I'm not ready to run with them but if I could fall down in front of them that would slow him up enough to keep him from getting to that past forty second punt Ford LeClair the sixtime allpro as this big start continues for Miami's deepest short kick from lek ler 33 yards officially 7 to nothing Miami you're watching the NFL on CBS talked about his illness last week was pumping himself full of meds to play today full strength saamana to Jose hey I'm making his presence known getting up and trying to distract Ryan Tannehill getting involved in terms of the run defense he could get off blocks with that athleticism as well as skinny in the game but heard about the Dolphins new approach in their physicality in terms of how they want to play said they got a new coach who's running a toughness campaign he's in but will give it back to a will fight power with power I love the way that he was able to articulate himself in our meetings mr. tan again excellent field position as tanana as a chef Kieth on C bar savage military making miss ranchers inside the funny plenty of open question 50 yards on a touchy one Jarvis Landry is not to be messed with this is a guy that is playing with great energy a great tempo and he just he's matched up against the safe you got to see him come here and then he's gonna run out and twenty nine this is going to be Andre how he can't stay with him and Eric's a separation he's not going to go out of bounds we talked about his determination Sparrow at the top of the game he's just a looting tacklers is going to find his way to the end zone trying to give this often some kind of smart some kind of big play we didn't think the emotion from last week could carry over to this week in terms of what Dan Campbell has instilled in his team but I think the players have caught that and the coach has spread and he said I'm gonna give him the spark but they have to go out and maintain it whatever Dan Campbell is selling to this point they're buying longest reception in a career of Jarvis Landry first touchdown catch of the season and the sixth of his twoyear career the lantree in our visit with him as the officials now are looking to see him and stepped out of bounds on the initial move call on the field is a touchdown and this is what they're looking at right there from that vantage point appear to be well inbounds 13 to nothing dolphins on CBS after review the ruling on the field is confirmed touchdown oh they'll put that on Jarvis laches early career highlight tape what a start for he and this Miami offense what a Ryan Tannehill tell us about Jarvis Landry he was talking about all of his receivers kind of giving us an evaluation he said when he got the Jarvis Landry oh he's just a football player he could do anything that you need a football player to do such versatility and you love the tenacity before today the last pass plane from Miami of 50plus yards was last December the 14th they've had two of them so far and we're still in the first quarter and it was just a nice little out route and he was able to stick that foot in the ground and elude the defender and once you get him going we showed him on a reverse play last week where he ran with this same kind of determination they couldn't get him on the ground til he got into the end zone and gets paid they're here again today and suddenly the skies have opened up here in Miami starting to rain but they're having a good old time as the Dolphins dominant to this point and Dan Campbell who wears his emotions on his sleeve feeling awfully good about this dolphins see Matt he is seen over the last five quarters well he knows how the game is supposed to be played the game is supposed to be played with emotion it allows you to take your game and your physicality to the next level that's even now the range coming that the fans are Orlean it were to stay dry as good as their team is playing here Tannehill two touchdown passes already in the first quarter Dan Campbell's got his team fired up the fans are getting wet just another day in Miami wild weather patterns in this part of the country and it has the feel of a party at this point for the home team in Summit what a difference we walked out of this stadium at the end of that week three game their home opener against Buffalo a game in which they were down at halftime 27 to nothing the place was dead the team lethargic what a difference from that day to where we see rainy and gamble dunk about he says you know you can compete and have fun you can improve and still have fun this is a game and players should enjoy it he said I wanted to put the fun back in football we made it competitive than our practices oneonone manonman and each guy had to prove himself in front of his teammates I just thought he did a wonderful job of sort of reinvigorating his players and allowing them to go out and feel what it felt like to have fun playing football again has it been fun so far through the Texas you see their first week possessions Chris Mulkey onto the field north set back behind Hoyer you were starting the game just one six passing this is Colton released by Philadelphia a guy that O'Brien really likes it's such a difference in the weather now saman what was the worst downpour you ever played in and how does this affect now the offense with lawyer Wow there's been a lot of those moments where the weather can affect the way that the quarterback handles the football the way the running backs handle the football it can the receivers fall it in those passes that are just on the fingertip now the ones that you would haul in are now going to skirt right off the hands of a potential receipt second and ten and polkas blown up and it really puts the Texas in a tough spot here down two touchdowns obviously means the pass game but now difficult to do that in the ran yeah you also need the run game I don't think you can get away from it even though you're down 14 nothing but how about this dalek ensued other players getting penetration into that back hill he is as we said before shut down the other teams run game and hit put pressure on the quarterback you force him into third and long now you get to pass well boyeur from the gun on third and 14 rolls that and that pass incomplete keith mumphrey the rookie only receiver in the vicinity and that miami secondary without Bryce McCain so far so good well you asked how does the weather affect things little you see your hands Chancellor facecentered 74 on the off that dock penalties decline fourth our mascot weather effects things for your miss the receiver was wide open Keith's mom for his wide open on that play now they're gonna go three and out for the fourth consecutive possession well the Texans seem that was suddenly Saturday Feb 3 last Sunday at Jacksonville two touchdowns and playing on their feels to say the least that isn't an jury panel give Tannehill a short field 36 yards on the pike now Shane LeClair has struggled nine yards on the return from Landry tonight at 60 minutes the first and only look inside the US air war against Isis plus an interview with Vice President Biden only on 60 minutes tonight rainy Miami spear adidas saman Wilcox west of our CBS crew so far these sexist fans that have made the trip haven't had much to cheer about Tannehill pitching a perfect game to this point six for six so far Houston Texas one yard total offense and I don't care how good their defense is if their office can't pitch in and play more complimentary football to be a long day for the Houston text first intent as they begin inside Texas territory it's Miller of course down to the 20 down hill to the 15yard line Jonathan Joseph finally able to bring him down as they continue to gash this defense well they were able to pull the guard look at number 63 Danah stop she's digging them out and then Miller No without block this is the power run game that damn Campbell has gotten back to and Lamar Miller has responded he's playing better I think the fact that they're tied in Deon Simms is back in number 80 the position that their head coach Dan Campbell wants to play are they're cranking it up getting loaded up at the line of scrimmage 29 yards on a run from Miller here he is again as he inches closer to the 13 a pickup of three we mentioned earlier Miller had 19 carries in that win last week that more than doubled his season average and again you don't fall behind early you can stick to the one game and it makes all the difference for this offense I think it makes a difference too we talked about Deon Simms being healthy remember they had lost left tackle Brandon Albert for spell there now he's back in the lineup he's healthy on that offensive line so the office blinds playing better I think they have bigger bodies that can change the line of scrimmage to get there back to the next level of the deal between emotion 77 Miller lives in a pile close to Kazan Millar the former fourth round pick in 2012 rushed for just over a thousand yards last season fifth best in the AFC dolphins have not had a running back rushed for a thousand yards in consecutive season since Ricky Williams did it he had Oh two and then again in o3c Lamar Miller his hands are wet he looks at ow to get them dried off very smart if you're gonna handle the ball you gotta make sure that you could possess it can't risk the turnover now if you're Houston you got to find a way to come up with a stop here Wayne has eased up a bit still coming down this is third and for tanning her looks right close up Annabella to injury and he's into the end zone for his second touchdown JV yards from Tannehill in my here the first are they run a crossing route all the way across the field and they sort of screamed the defender off Jarvis Landry and I think it's a person see he's going to be here but then watch the receivers all come here as Landry comes across and then he's going to clear away from the defender Kinney steals just provided enough of the screen to give him the edge to beat Kevin Johnson for the touchdown great play design Dan Campbell loves it you just wonder where this offense was from Miami over the first four weeks of the season third touchdown pass thrown in the quarter by tan Hill and a second to that manner Jarvis Landry receiving touchdown before today through the second year of mantry he's got two of them in the corner as Andrew Franks is good on his point after this Houston Texans secondary they enter today's game allowing the fourth highest total of touchdown passes they've already given up three touchdown passes today Kareem Jackson one of those starting quarters out today due to injury Kevin Johnson whom salma just mentioned making the start in his place Quentin Demps is banged up off and active but so far all kinds of issues for JJ Watt and that defense and meantime Jarvis Landry is Amida catalyst to the stoppage office he's made two plays there's no doubt about it five passes so far in this game found his way to the end zone twice his ability to create yards after catch sibling at LSU for offensive coordinator Cam Cameron talked both he and Odell Beckham jr. every single position whether it was H F X Y or Z so we can line up anywhere if we just want to be able to get the ball in our hands doesn't have the best speed he does have great quickness but I think more than anything he's got to NASA T's got intensity he's a competitor Andrew Franks on to boot it away that is mumphrey again unable to play it on Tuesday the Dolphins partnered with the United Way in Special Olympics to host a hometown huddle event over 100 students in the 1st and 8th grades from Dade and Broward County Schools participated the event spread the Dolphins dolphin message of Education physical fitness and positive choices as this franchise has had incredible ties to this community for so many years finally trying to give their fans something to feel good about as they have blitz to Texas with this uppercut punch in this first quarter to see the total yards discrepancy at the top of your screen that first down pass from Boyer and sent it from Foster Jenkins on the coverage and this offense Samet about as bad as you can expect so far and I know the Miami Dolphins have improved in intensity and attitude all those things we talked about but if you're the Houston Texans you put up a fight and right now Brian Hoyer you've got to lead this office do you have playmakers like DeAndre Hopkins around you have an Arian Foster you've got to be able to get it going right now Brian Hoyer 1 for 8 the 7 yards here in the first and often foster foster still trying to get his way to full strength it's a devastating groin injury in August tore the groin the muscle off the bone completely such a devastating loss for an offense that is so reliant on him but last week's AMA the best that he's looked in probably a year they are surprised at how quickly he came back from that injury and I thought when I put the tape on last week he looked really good but that season low or career low average was to the National Football League he's much better than them in his careerlow 4.9 this year and nearly 2 yards per carry that's Garrett Graham one of their backup tight ends now to go off of his fingertips in they have not helped Hoyer until this point to a punch I ain't need this leg from Gary Graham Brian Hoyer needs Graham to make that catch put the ball right on them this is somewhat wet down there we saw the rain come down the rain has stopped that imagine the balls wet the grounds wet but you got to make the play for your quarterback five possessions five green outs for Hoyer in this office look at the lanes with how many tackles has he broken till this point well for an awful lot of real estate but he's going backwards Lantry trying to find a scene he may have run about 70 yards on that play it seemed like but loses eight as it is a 53yard punt officially now we talked about Dan Campbell emphasizing toughness and competitiveness this was Wednesday's practice he brought all the players together in midfield have a younger guys in the middle of a huddle surrounded by the vets it was a rugby style scrum where the players on the inside had to escape and get past the veterans on the outside say they don't see very often fight their way out here at all it's like you know the old bull and the young bull he just wanted the guys to be competitive get used to mixing it up and being physical every single day at practice so that when you get into a game on Sunday becomes this is Miller and posting ten bounces to the outside and upended as he gets nearly to the 25 Kevin Johnson the rookie cornerback on the tackle we asked Campbell about some of the coaches he's a played for in coach trip you mentioned Bill Parcells he says ourselves when he was in Dallas used to line up the entire team 26 guys down the middle of a field oneonone and they would just rammed into each other and those oneonone drills until they were sore I said you do the tough guys were right he said there's no doubt the entire team was tough and you know those Parcells teams they won't really reliant on quarterback play as much as they were just um being physical teams that ran the ball played great defense secondly to tannenhill funded under the top layer chin to Miller straight up the gut crosses the 30 first down run as this offense continues to get anything it wants with 62 seconds left in the quarter oh there they've come out to compete they want to win but they know they got to compete to do some interesting formation on this first and 10 play tech C's appeared to be fooled but they are able to converge on Tannehill as the Dolphins will face a second down coming up Brandon done out of Louisville on the tackle today beyond cloudy is the one who disrupted this play he's got to be here wide she just stepped right in that passing lane but he's going to intercept it and that's what calls Tannehill to pull it down and then try to run with the ball but you know yellow Brian talked about today me on Kylie said he's a bright player stud really hard he's more instinctive then you would believe and he saw it on that black Santa Hill swings at me still has me in completion to this point he's eight of his first day that's Matthew's who had a 53yard touchdown catch earlier picks up ten and another Miami first down to take us to the end of the quarter 21 to nothing Dolphins will return to Miami after these messages you watch in the NFL on CBS Hall of Super Bowl 50 pull all the confidence that Brian Hoyer and this Houston offense had generated after the win last Sunday but afterthought quickly forgot until this point there is Ryan Mallett and just an interesting little backstory mallet isn't told you at the top of the show miss the team charter here yesterday paid his way here he commercially arrived last night is in uniform and he's active and Osama knee down three touchdowns Bill O'Brien has had a very quick hook whether it's been Hoyer whether it's been mallet but now with the situation involving Ryan Mallett you wonder what's going through his mind here's his lawyers show there Hoyer is off to a slow start this is typically a case where maybe Bill O'Brien would go to the next quarterback but given the fact that the guy couldn't set his watch in time to make his flight you have to wonder even if his head is in the game if he's ready to play so maybe O'Brien is more class they would Hoyer we're in normal cases he would go to Ryan secondly me and pick the ender lantern lantern little screencast this is Miller and looked way too easy they were able to outflank the defense and for Lamar Miller he's never had an easier touchdown in his life says welldesigned play well blocked any steel is the receiver he's going to throw a nice block as well now see you're gonna see them it's gonna be right here but watch them just come right out of the backfield and he'll catch a nice screen play they kiddy steals down the field he gets a block look he doesn't get touched from there excellent blocking down 54 yards on the catch and run fourth touchdown pass thrown by Ryan Tannehill and it goes from bad to worse for the Houston Texans 28 to nothing as we play in the opening minute in a 2nd quarter you're watching the NFL on CBS well this was the conversation between Bill O'Brien and his defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel during that last break Romeo a very proud football man has been coaching some of the best defenses in this league for a long time so far this hasn't been their day 28 to nothing as this defense has been victimized by the big play sama to say the least right now this deep this could stop a nosebleed they've allowed four cuts I possessions for the Miami Dolphins they've allowed three plays of fifty jaws for war whether it's the shark Matthews or this job is Landry whether it's Lamar Miller they're taking it to the house hustle by this Houston Texas defense right now Romeo Crennel we've got to get his guys together they got to find a way to improve their play three of those four Tannehill touchdown passes have come of 15 or more yards first in 10 years we're still looking for their first question and I've just hard to believe that pass now he's down complete while you're kind of clutching in his right throwing shoulder Derek Shelby was the man giving chase they'll be planted or you're into the ground figured if I'm going to run this way someone's getting hit and the seed plant that right shoulder into the ground never a good thing for a quarterback lawyer remains in the huddle Malik's waiting right now hire one of 10 seven yards passing on the day ceil yards of total offense for the Texans to this battle deflected and intercepted with shadows are you kidding me it's pokies law what can go wrong has gone wrong though tight heads just pops this one up we saw a Joan says thank you I'll take it runs it in for a touchdown and that backflip I'm sorry Dan Cal was going to say we got to be careful of doing that it was CJ Fedora which the tight end and look Hoyer hasn't been very good but we have seen multiple drops Solomon from his receivers in his first half in that one comes back to haunt them 23 yards on a pick six by Jones what a wild week this is a Miami team that appeared dead in the water a couple of weeks ago suddenly up 35 said nothing as they look for their second with in as many weeks the maintenance crew has been busy here the University of Miami played against Clemson here yesterday were blown out 58 to nothing quickly got this stadium turned around and this time the home team is on the better end of a blowout till this point 35 to nothing 14 points for the Dolphins in the last 14 seconds there is monthly with plate prices the 15 past the 20 and brought down at the 23 to pick sixes for Jones in the last two weeks Rashad Jones is I think one of the best safeties he probably never heard of makes bigtime plays he's a bigtime hitter and he talked about it I'm not as buffle but he's doing these backflips every time he gets into the end zone he's awarded his hip from Fedora wins he's able to get it into the house and he knows that back look again how absurd Campbell's got to talk to him about that because you need worse are gels on the field healthy doing what he does best Nerys foster little Juke step picking up some yardage as he crosses the 25 we talked to her shot Jones yesterday about Kevin Coyle their defensive coordinator who was fired a couple of weeks ago Jones was very close to him called him pops and said that he wants to finish the season strong and still thinking about his defensive coordinator at this point yeah Kevin poyo he said told him that a here's the guy here's the guy that just really kind of called me in to talk to me about being a really good player but has it deflected out of his hands it's fumbled and Hawaii falls on the football just past the 25 as they recover at the 26 Lou and a room oh you saw it on the sideline the new defensive coordinator after the change and there's Bill O'Brien there's a naru mo ami Miami side part of the coaching shake up you saw Matt over the last couple of weeks he's the former defensive back coach and he had coached Rashad Jones in that group they needed to make some changes they now have the spark they were looking for but Kevin poyo is still remembered by many of these players who saw jealous is just one of many bird seven hires passed behind his target mate Washington and once again the Texas wolf on this defense has been really tough on Hoyer they're getting after defensive lines getting after tight coverage on the back end Anna Romo he's doing a really good job of just coordinating his defense Joe Jones told us all he's done is made the calls more clear more simple so we can play fast sexy still without a first down as Andrea will play it just inside his own 25 minimal return 53yard punt from Leclerc all miami on CBS what a great start to Cincinnati by week to celebrate their incredible 6a no start as to see Brian Hoyer on that Houston sideline no one could have imagined a nightmare start like this Samba down five touchdowns yeah this Houston Texans football team they got to get it going the defense has got to be able to recognize what Miami is doing all they're doing is a bunch of bubble screens quick passing from Ryan Tannehill but yet they're not tackling they're able to turn those short games into long runs and find their way into the end zone little draw play to Miller some is just such a crazy a couple of weeks ago coaching change here when a disastrous home opener against the bills in week three now suddenly if they can put the finishing touches get the second straight win a Miami team that was a trendy pick in the preseason suddenly back in contention oh there's no doubt about it if you're Bill O'Brien you look at the AFC South no one's running away with that division either but right no these teams got to wake up you're right from week to week we're getting different personalities from from some of these things this Landry emotion Tannehill on second and nine come on on the run completes this with chard Matthews just inside the 40 12 yards and a Miami first down huge difference for Ryan Tannehill he talked about how close he was to head coach Joe Philbin who's been let go he says look we didn't get it done we weren't productive change was needed and I think what bill laser has done he's allowed him to get on the move get rid of the ball get the ball out of his hands quickly but obviously the improvement of the run game is giving him much greater rhythm within the offense who saw the brilliant as you charge so far from Tannehill 10 of his firsts here three of his four touchdown passes up in front 50 plus yards miss tackle had appeared to be from jj1 as Miller makes him pay for picks up seven there we talked about his fear Oh missed tackles but you've got to be able to get there there this will work he's there or several guys you've missed them you know JJ what's gonna he's gonna play hard he's got a hustle but these guys now they've got to play better as a group and not just rely on one or two guys to make the plays Miller gets blood Damian Williams to set the year running of Oklahoma onto the field this is nandri gets to the outside right at the first down market John Simon the thirdyear linebacker out of Ohio State able to run him out of bounds and the officials say first down Miami we told you Jarvis Landry just like a running back they're gonna get him involved in the run game Simon's clawing at trying to get him out of bounds Landry refuses to be denied the opportunity to pick up the first down look at that soil first downs on the day for the Dolphins anemic Houston Texas offense they've got nothing done today total yards 300 for the Dolphins in Texas Burstyn 10way action from Tannehill nice block at the end of spring him loose nowhere to throw but out of bounds and that his first incompletion as a penalty marker thrown in the houston secondary comes at the 936 mark of the second quarter illegal contact 29 down and that's been the kind of day you know we've seen so far from Houston Andre Howell on the penalty yeah you got to see tannaz gonna roll out to his left there's a pill back block right there by number 34 Damien Williams you know the penalty on how happened way down the field clear on the backside sometimes I don't know if it's really an obstruction the quarterback have a chance to throw the ball to the receipt miss Miller getting to the outside I think that's a question that a lot of fans have been asking with all the penalties the game that for a lot of people has become over officiated in some ways so with the penalty that Tannehill incompletion negated so he's still perfect at 10 of 10 for 213 yards and the four touchdowns he is in good rhythm and they have kept their quarterback standing up hasn't been hit it's very comfortable and he's in sinking in relevant now this is something they've done went down a hill and looked at four more snaps under Center for the quarterback Tannehill on 2nd and 5 facing the pressure and sex John Simon one of their backup light back who's getting there there is a penalty markets wrong Simon beat Chauhan James on that play immediately illegal shift offense penalty is declined result the play the second down alright so Simon the thirty year linebacker who came over from Baltimore on a free agent contract before last season finally making a play for Bill O'Brien's defense a gala Med second and long and now the key is to really I think just to improve their tackling I think so many missed tackles where they've had Jarvis land to pointblank range he's able to escape and be able to get the touchdown the same with the long catching rod on the rishard Matthews fillet many of them have come after a missed at some kind of a delay here our referee John Hussey the discussion on the field after declining the penalty after discussion it is third down after the penalty that should have been changed so it is third down officially and that will certainly change the play call here for Tannehill and the offense so third and 13 from the houston 47 and now the wind has given way to plenty of sunshine here in South Florida little short passes quite that's Miller another marker thrown right behind the line of scrimmage Jonathan Joseph on the tackle for Houston as Miller was well short of the first down marker real aggressive tackle by Jonathan Joseph that's what Romeo Crennel is looking for there's no foul on the play for an elephant man downfield fourth down the game has come to a a bit of a grinding halt e'er the summary you look ahead there's still plenty of time left two and a half quarters thirty five to nothing you just wonder what you can say to your team if you're Bill O'Brien at halftime after really what's been an embarrassing first half performance think what you say is don't worry about the scoreboard you just come out and play one play at a time let's see if we can put a bunch of good positive affective plays together and see what we can do and the spoil take care of itself I think that has to be the critical focus Houston 40 that punt from dar 41 yards will await the call here from our referee who's suddenly a busy man John Hussey first year as an NFL referee illegal formation on the kicking team that penalty be enforced from the deadball spot he keeps the ball first down 35 then nothing is Miami's second quarter on CBS 35 to nothing you know what has been one of the most lopsided halves of football in the NFL this season get up high in the air still loose and it falls incomplete one of the few breaks that the Texans have had today saman we came into the show talking about DeAndre Hopkins and as we look at the replay so far Miami has taken him away in this game yeah and look I think that's in dama can sue who was able to bat that ball up obstructing the view of Hoyer but you're right they've taken away Hoyer's primary target DeAndre Hopkins he hasn't caught a ball yet in this game short pass from the wire that's Nate Washington on the reception as you see what Hopkins has done so far there if that's the single coverage but boy you're overthrows and doesn't give him the chance to haul it in that one he couldn't hold on to it because of tight covers you could see Brent Grimes doing a good job of keeping him from getting on top and coverage so Hopkins right now still trying to find his way Palace first into the tech seats today at the 7:45 mark of the second quarter and that's one thing that Hawaii told us in our sitdown with him yesterday is that they expected that to start to happen teams to target him doubled him a little bit more and taken away really just make someone else beat him on this offense Nate Washington is a guy that's got to begin to make some plays the tight ends fedora wits and Graham have to make plays but both of them and put the ball on the ground in fact mordor wits calls an interception because he couldn't haul the pass thrown to him in and it was returned for a touchdown on Sept 30 10 Hopkins on a comebacker it is a completed pass i suffered by hopkins to come back olivier vernon on the shut against lawyer 10 yards on blood he pays for this work watch it complete but not without paying the price marcus mariota last week i find it over $37,000 that's foster able to bounce to the outside chased by Adama consume you mentioned named Washington summon didn't play the last two weeks with that hamstring injury they've had injuries Cecil Shorts is down today shorts who finally gave them a nice effort last week we just can't seem to get healthier yeah I think for as much attention DeAndre Hopkins is going to draw from defenders than the receiver opposite of him Nate Washington in this case is gonna have to begin to produce to take that double coverage off DeAndre Hoffman in second down Pass is complete as Hopkins as they move inside Miami Territory 8 yards as Hopkins makes his second catch Hopkins even told is it yeah we're gonna start to get more double coverage I'm gonna have to remain patient he said last year we're team to do it I find myself getting frustrated is it but I'm just gonna have to allow the game to come back to me sooner or later I will get the oneonone opportunity under pressure and his first down pass intended for crisp polka falls incomplete we touched on the just a historic case that Hopkins was on coming into this game last week became the first player in league history to post nine plus catches and better than 145 yards in three consecutive games and you just wondering how he was doing it okay instability at the quarterback position healthy number two receiver behind you to this point Hill crosses the 35 first down one for the taxi to suddenly is often showing some signs of life there you can see the explosive run by foster but more on DeAndre Hopkins he said that he had to work with both quarterbacks mallet and Hoya he didn't know who would be the starter and spent a lot of time working with both this off scene the work that has paid off to this point Texans fans not thinking about any of that at this point there's a nightmare first half continues that pass intended for the rookie mumphrey falls incomplete what if bill O'Brien's team can somehow find their way into the endzone here before going in at the half it's just about one play at a time one possession Spiro out of time to get the ball into the end zone that's what you have to do it the deep it's going to have to come out and create some total this is people coming over from Philadelphia released by the Eagles it's been a huge asset for them especially on third down but again you look at the struggles of this team Salman and right now entering the day just one game off the pace but Indianapolis in the South yeah come away with a win here get to 500 you're going to find yourself at about eighty nine and seven I think able to win this division out of it any of these we should point out the pulse right now down 20 to nothing against the states lawyers past you said o'clock that's Washington or astounded ward duksoo shoulder inside the 20 close to the 15 shackled by Rashad Jones a pickup of 16 or just what we call Nate washes his name oneonone coverage against tomorrow Taylor you can see he's able to separate at the top of his route and make the catch get him down inside the red zone this is where normally Hoyer would want to rely on those tight ends but today they haven't been so reliable play action it's incomplete again off the hands of Garrett Graham Bobby McCain quickly converging another drum by Houston receivers and they've got to do something about this the door which is got to come in for Graham because he Graham drops this one now he's got to head over to the bitch gonna hear from Bill O'Brien dolphins though they're played physical they've got something to do with some of the drops you saying mr. Bennet has ever had to suffer through as difficult to have his this at any level football employer towards the end zone intended for Graham is in complete coverage on the play by Rashad Jones order was drawn to lead him away from Jones y'all still just got a great read look he goes to the front side shoulder and that's how you almost get that interception sometimes down inside the red zone it's a quarterback particularly with a big tight in you don't want to lead them as much as what to put the ball right on them and away from the defender so maybe the ball on the back of your there would have been a better plan forty play the dragon sex meddling flag fraud just beyond the line of scrimmage inside the 20 it was just about to say third down was when Hoyer was so effective last week and their victory in Jacksonville aside he fessed number 15 fiveyard penalty Valerie its Olivier Vernon on a penalty huge break for the Texas yeah you're gonna see him right there he's got a jump get into that neutral zone before the snap of the ball so the penalty will make it third and five and another chance for Houston as Dan Campbell up side from the other side of the field we receive that at the bottom of screen I think that's the fallback their defense twosix for the first down and foster doesn't get it now you would think Hoyer would recognize that the defense wasn't quite lined up he could have went with a quick snap there threw the ball to jonathan Grimes the fullback who was lined up on the right side of the formation no one was covered in Spiro and that's where the real veteran quarterbacks the Tom Grady's the peyton manning's they recognize the defense you go quick count and come away with an easy touchdown I'm sure they're talking to him about it like did no one covering number 41 the fullback Jonathan Grimes George Godsey their offensive coordinator taking over the play calling from Bill O'Brien and there he is at the bottom of your screen look at him no one's out there OS go cover him a veteran quarterback see you got to look out there you got to snap the ball get yourself an easy tug they still haven't covered them and then watch he is still running around scrambling trying to find who to cover I think if you're a quarterback that's where we talk about football IQ and having a sense of the presence in the huddle that's where being able to do things that are maybe unscripted to be able to manufacture points really help your team there's one sided a quarterback comparison as you'll see you know one half of football in the NFL affects you from Tannehill three touchdown passes of 50 or more yards as why you're desperately tries to get his team in the endzone look like Dan Campbell signaled for time out that'll be the first timeout taken by Miami as Houston gets ready for a fourth and two with NFL mobile watch local in primetime NFL games live on your smartphone learn more at nfl.com / mobile speer adidas Sowell cots west of our CBS crew from Miami week 7 battle between two teams looking for their third win of the season two teams coming off road wins last week now down here inside the red zone fourth and two most likely you're gonna throw it right and the tight ends have been getting open that's the one thing about it we talked about how many passes Bureau that they've dropped so far in this game but they are getting open they're getting opportunities test ball now they've just got to catch it intended for Jonathan Grimes trying to make the Bobolink it's Bobby McCain the rookie on the coverage and a turnover on downs gives it that's in Miami that's not where you want to go with the book to me I think you got to go here but you can see you have your fullback out there and that's where they eventually want to go but watch the ball should have came out right there did the Andre Hopkins who ultimately came open so Hoyer just throws it up for grabs to the fullback who's in coverage against the corner no way is he going to win that battle I think you got to have better feel for where you want to go with the ball if you're Hoyer and any time you get DeAndre Hopkins in oneonone coverage that's where you got to go Houston Drive 15 plays 66 yards but it stalls inside the Miami 2 Miller Miller 13 Russia's as he approaches 90 yards on the day so many contributors for this Miami offense till this point is you see why now it looks like he's shaken up it's not something you'd normally see JJ Watt coming up Lane he's such a hard worker you know he talked about the improvement you saw from their team last week he said hey there's nothing like hard work I kind of looked at him you know but I'm gonna see him right on your left on the left side there he is penetrating right in front of the ball carrier slips and falls down there dan Campbell marveling yesterday at watt says he's a guy who just never seems to get tired as they will continue to look at JJ Watt second and fouryear Santa Hill on NewsCenter this is Miller another wide open see Miller still going plenty of open grass in front of them 2010 85 yards as Miller is into the endzone for the first time split the defense and they get him cut off they get them cut off they get them walled off and that's how you're able to score it's gonna be off this right side see they're gonna come here and watch they're gonna get the linebacker number fifty mikeam did he gets walled off once he can't get to the next level you missed again tackles in the secondary from there the speed of Lamar Miller gets him into the end zone it always starts with a missed tackle first our first time of the end zone for Miller on a rushing score today had a receiving touchdown earlier as that point after feu Franks is no good maybe the first thing that has gone wrong for the Dolphins this afternoon Romeo Crennel cannot be happy he's allowed Lamar Miller 175 rushing yards here in the first half poor tackling from Romeo Crennel defenses just doesn't sound right is not something that's common his defenses are known for being very good against the run very good in terms of tackling in terms of technique and fundamentals we have not seen that from the Texans defense here today so JJ Watt you having to come off the field for a play and Miller makes him pay for it as he runs 85 yards for the touchdown a little history for you the Green Bay Packers tie the lead record as they put up 49% points against Tampa Bay and route to a 55:14 victory that was October the second nineteen three as this Miami team has blown the doors off this game we're still 2 inches left before halftime look at the rushing yards it is incredible Solomon sometimes these games just don't make any sense sitting here and you try to analyze it what's happened in front of you but this has been hard to believe the Texans team that was confident after the road winning Nashville last Sunday with multiple uppercut punches in this first half and if this was a heavyweight fight I'd have stopped it a long time a long time ago right from bleeding hemorrhaging if you will Salman maybe it's us last time we were here week 3 it was 27 to nothing at halftime dolphins were losing to the bills Joe Philbin was fired open a little over a week after that see on I go the other way I I understand that I'm powerless in the position that I have up here I have nothing to do with what's taking place out there we haven't missed attack what we haven't made attack or haven't caught the ball at all foster fraud since the 25 close to 30 10 yards on the run that's either gonna be an awfully quiet Houston locker room at halftime or there be Gatorade Eli's yeah tables could be broken someone's got to wake them up right this Houston Texans team is not as bad as what you're seeing here in the first half went straight to hiatus for your time he's an optimist runs out of bounds as he picks up a Houston first down a pickup of 11 but there's no doubt about its bureau that Dan Campbell has touched the pulse of this football team and he is awaken these players in like every good coach he's getting the best of his 53 on this roster what appears as though JJ Watt is okay physically mature he's got a lot going through his mind have to leave the game for one play Lamar Miller runs for an 85yard touchdown to make it 41 to nothing on a two minutes before halftime the channel again endemic ensue finally with his per sec we'll see if it stands penalty marker throwing right at the line of scrimmage how about that some excitement from Adamic ensue it we didn't see that we were here for their home opener against Buffalo but you know Dan Campbell said hey he's been working hard he's been trying and sort of collaborating with the coaches of things that they could do differently on defense there's no foul on the play the office lined up early roll the family beam and got in the legal position before the snap second down he's been waiting a long time for his first sack is a dolphin here in week seven there he is right there he just keeps working detaches finds his way to Hoyer good play first two issues to reinventing first five games of the season without a set second and 17 and guess where they kept all began with Sue it comes in waves last week Cameron wake had four sacks himself for the six sacks they had in the game and now in consecutive plays at dama could sue comes away with a sack the floodgates are just pouring in on Brian Hoyer once already been a rollercoaster of a season for Sioux when we see the team struggling over the first four or five weeks of the season it was that early report that he was freelancing away from what the scheme was with the defensive coordinator everyone deny that that was the case Feeney has been on his back here lack of production but this is a chance for the star defensive tackle to start to pad his stats and you and I were here earlier in the season there's no way I thought he was freelancing but you can see the energy over the last two games has been different so I think when you're Adamic ensue it you're used to being the force to be reckoned with when it's not there people are going to question your f bird and 25 active multiple sex couple is loose pressure coming from Cameron wait who had that incredible force sack performance last week Houston able to recover wake at the bottom of your screen look he just ripped right around the right tackle that's gonna be Chris Clark and Clark is no match for Cameron wait wait talked about exceed hey you know I kind of need my hamstring to play and my best he was hampered with that hamstring injury early in the season said he use the bye week to get healthy and then last week was unleashed four four sacks of that game his four sacks tied for the most in a half an NFL history only Chris Clemons in the late Derrick Thomas have done it this is what they dreamed of Sparrow and Donovan sue Cameron wake Olivia Vernon push on the inside it one on one blocking against those hands on the we got it going today luckily are able to get the contact this is Landry has some room and we'll play it excellent coverage down the field by the Texans after a 47yard punt coming up the horizon halftime report from New York JB Bart boat boomer in coach Cowher and standby have all the latest scores in highlights look at your preview of Thursday Night Football coming up on CBS and NFL Network all coming up on the Verizon halftime report flag was thrown behind Landry the team went out of bounds on his own that is a fiveyard penalty Miami is elected to reek it the ball fourth down Osama mentioned of the schedule one thing to keep in mind from Miami we've had to buy already behind them but this is a short week after today they'll begin immediate preparations for Tom Brady and the Patriots coming up on Thursday night I had to be the real test right everyone questioned if the energy and spark that Dan Campbell provided and his first game as the Dolphins head coach one week ago against Tennessee could it carry over how much of emotion can you sustain from week to week and you know it's going to be tested on Thursday night as they travel up to Gillette Stadium to take on the Patriots gonna take and require more than emotion got to have good discipline good football IQ boy he's got to be tough halftime in Patriots Jets game right now New England up 13 to 10 another market throwing away at the 15 this isn't an tree dancing Houston territory gets down to the 47 at some point we'll get to halftime here the officials have been awfully busy with the penalties 63 seconds remaining in the second during the kick holding receiving team number 31 that will t be enforced from the end of the kick first down it's Michael Thomas there's a shooter game summary till this point with 103 remaining Ryan Tannehill still perfect at 11 of 11 as he played better I don't know that I've seen Ryan Tannehill play better than what we're seeing here in the first half four touchdown passes it's hitting receivers in stride allowing yards after the catch even on the screen catching rod by Lamar Miller that ball was lofted perfectly allow him to catch it and run it and make his way to the end zone his first ever NFL start came against the Houston Texans in 2012 at nightmare against JJ Watt in this defense Whitman so for two quarters into this one business that's Jordan Cameron makin guys miss runs out of bounds after a first down catch and run of 13 yards another reminder is a another penalty flag is thrown Verizon halftime report coming up next best scores in highlights plus a preview of Thursday Night Football it's all coming up on the Verizon halftime report Dan gamble he's not thinking his foot off the pedal that's still throwing 56 seconds left throw the ball down the field stepping out of bounds to conserve time most teams would take a knee right now and kind of take it in but not this team I guess they've been on a knee maybe those first four games right continue to get this operation here wanted to keep Miami offense in his bench at this point close to 10 past daddy Hill area down the field it's caught that's the rookie Devante Parker we'll see if it stands penalty marker thrown away in the vicinity that gets 35 yard pass play infant stance I'm sure bill O'Brien you got to go tell his team hey is 50 seconds left in the half they're still throwing deep ointment they're wanting more points they're not taking their foot off the gas pedal there are two thoughts on the play one by each team illegal formation number 84 offense pass interference 34 defense both dolls were declined by rule first down so offset mental negate the play AJ boy hey the man penalized for Houston action joined by roll for Miami maybe Miami's going for that record of points score to hit first half of a football game but you know Dan cam has come in and preaching hey play hard play hard all the time maybe that's something he wants to continue to preach to his football team and maybe this is an example of 10 and cloudy gets them from the back and to Debian Cloudy with his first NFL set in his 10th career game who's able to beat the left tackle Branden Albert I thought Albert had he blocked for a while but see Tannehill holds on to the ball way to argue he's got a drifty in the pocket didn't even since that clown he was stalking him from behind but sooner or later you got to cut that ball loose first career sacked for today via a clown clowny who had been playing well prior to the ankle injury that sidelined him for their game last Sunday 1st overall pick 2014 was already endured an assortment of injuries as planning makes another play as he brings Jonas Gray to the turf and mercifully the first half will come to an end for the Houston Texas 40 lights and nothing we'll be back with a Verizon halftime report after this you watching the NFL on CBS Paul of Super Bowl 50 back with you in Miami 41 to nothing and what was a stunningly onesided opening half let's get you a look now at who you'd love it and presented by McDonald's Ryan Tannehill Jarvis Landry you came with some of the early game fireworks 50plus yards on the catch and run getting his way into the end zone and that was a sign of things to come to say the very least at 1 welcome to the NFL on CBS the Houston Texans have come on the field there will be second half just stunning some and what we saw in the first half what were your impressions well I knew Dan Campbell had lit a spark under his football team but I didn't know he had lit an inferno the way they came out like gangbusters in that first quarter they just poured it on throughout the first half of this ballgame in the way that they are running the ball member last week they had 180 yards rushing in the entire game while they had over a hundred and eighty yards rushing in the first half of today's game they came out they were able to create turnovers they created big plays on offense the 50yard variety he's got his knee playing at a high level now for the Houston Texans totally shocked at build O'Brien's group because they came out tremendously flat they could not tackle Brian Hoyer couldn't get anything going on the offensive side of the ball 65 yards total offense in the entire first half for the Houston Texans some and what Tim Bill O'Brien do if anything to just make this game respectable in the second half well I think if you're a Houston make a play make a tackle now they didn't do either one of those things in the first half so it starts with that one play at a time one possession at a time and then if you're the Miami Dolphins then I think you've got to run it all the way home eat clock and get out of here with a win the more you're running the their time off the clock it just fades away my dad Campbell said that the official home opener was something that his team put behind them he said this and effects becomes our home opener today in our conversation with him yesterday as they have hit the reset button and have played some incredible football over the last six quarters Campbell V 39 yearold intron and coach taking over after that game in London a couple of weeks back after the firing of Joe Philbin this is being the employers has been so good for this club on special teams crosses the 20 and gets out close to 225 a return of 30 Ryan Tannehill hasn't played much better perhaps in his career you see what he did with this offense as Tannehill 12 for 12 four touchdowns in the first half how about that for high level of productivity four touchdowns on their first five possessions and then came out and got more after that so Dan Campbell has really done a lot with this team and he and Darren ryszard the special teams coach they kind of share some of those responsibilities spiro in terms of what they're doing procedurally but some of the timeouts and how they manage things that you go for it on fourth down so I think they're doing a wonderful job of getting this going in the right direction poor old Mitchell at one time Houston Texan even again and pull back one of the starters along their defensive front not only a former Texan but a native Houston former third round pick by the Texans in 2010 he's the large guy I can tell you that six three three ten at fullback sanim position he played in college so he likes it he loves coming in there now he gets the tee off and hit someone as opposed on defense being here this is second intent dolphins are keeping on the ground with beanie and Williams saman you've been around this game a long time it's such an emotional game and as a player you just wonder psychologically where you are after a half like that where you know it's just been as bad as it gets if you're talking about that Houston side of the field well that's where character shows up it really is okay seemingly you don't have a whole lot to play for but yes you do you're playing for pride you're playing for the opportunity to get better here in the second half because you're gonna go back Monday you're gonna put the tape on and the coach is gonna call out every single guy particularly guys who didn't play hard late in the game third and 11 dolphins just trying to gain some of that yardage back that's Jonas Gray who is well short of that first down marker we told you earlier the cults were losing against the Saints 20 to nothing as that the game went to halftime so from Houston's point of view in all the games that they've lost in as bad as they've looked today at this moment they are one game out of first place in the AFC South that has to be motivation enough that's our the rookie I had to call his number much today boots away a goodlooking pic it'll be monk free from his own 16 head Senate coverage down the field 55 yards on the punt and five on the return on CBS 41 did nothing as we welcome you back to Miami opening minutes second half scurvy to Solomon Wolcott's our entire CBS drew Matt producer Ryan Galvin he had to goldberg our director as the Texans with their first offensive possession of this second half Samet first half numbers for this offense not much to talk about for the Texas eight possessions and they've had to punt six times it's very anemic only 65 yards total off into first half for the Houston Texans I don't think they could do any worse so now they've just got to get some rhythm and get it going seconded seven mrs. foster sat with Hoyer his offense was was feeling good about what they did last week we'll finally it appeared as a quarterback that step forward for this team with the flipflopping between Hoyer and mallet and it just goes to show you how now pool elite this could be week to week yeah when you think you got it going it comes off the rails player if you just join us six of twenty three thousand 61 yards and the interception that is certainly not something that could put on his shoulders bobble masks off the hands of the tight end CJ Fedora which that's Nate Washington on the first down catch as they are able to move the chains for only the eighth time today they're going with a no huddle not necessarily a hurry up going with a no huddle trying to reel off as many opportunities as they can iris said he has been at his best when they have put into place no choice but to do that here down forty one another this is Foster trying to get to the forty except maybe a half yard or think about everything brian hoyer has been through in his career undrafted out of Michigan State caught on with New England it would seem that went to the Super Bowl has been cut multiple times cut by his hometown team which basically told him they didn't want him anymore benched in favor of Johnny Manziel let's put all that behind them has endured a rollercoaster of the season either this year in the first seven weeks his lawyer told us yesterday that experience in Cleveland basically has prepared him for anything he faces from this point on yeah you even asked him you say well you've been named the starter it looks like you're gonna be the guy he said that it that means nothing to me here's a guy that you kind of get but since then he's been jaded a little bit by some of the things that have happened cuz clearly in Cleveland he outplayed Johnny Manziel and I'm sure for the life of him he can't figure out why he's no longer there but he has been able to move on he said but he's just gonna take it daybyday he knows that Ryan Mallett is lurking and waiting in the wings but he's got to be more productive as the quarterback of this team if he's gonna maintain his position as the starting quarterback Texans have to burn a timeout early stages third quarter on CBS wild weather here in South Florida we've had rain we've had sunshine but it's been a party if you're a dolphin's fans at this point where his home game that they've played here since that week three shellacking at the hands of the Buffalo Bills third and nine Hoyer from the gun after the timeout there is it at far side intended for Hopkins the dominant performances from DeAndre Hopkins Solomon have come to an end here in week seven yeah the pressure on his quarterback continues and Domenic ensue CJ Moseley 94 making sure that boyars uniform is getting dirty today they've been a relentless terms of getting hits on the quarterback if you've just joined us Adamic ensue with his first two sets as a dolphin came on successive plays late in that second quarter a punt by shane Legler 51 yards and 9 on the return for Miami two weeks to top teams in the NFL first the Dolphins take on Tom Brady and their old friends from New England on CBS and NFL Network and then the Browns and the unbeaten Bengals only on NFL Network that will come your way on November the 5th here's what the AFC East looks like at this point big one today between New England and the Jets and right now the Patriots in front 16 to 10 what was the game everyone was talking about heading into week number seven years Tannehill sex it's JJ one and Anthony without a sack in his last two and that drought little mini drought comes to an end he had been hobbled the end of the first half but look he's got enough to explode get that arm over move gets rid of the running back still able to come away with the sack they would have beat two blockers laying at the line of scrimmage and then he was able to beat Damien Williams to come away with the sack it does lead the NFL and it's apples for a loss and are in this one today despite before that play a couple of guys in a planet crisis 20 bastard 25 and close to the 30yard line and what would be a Miami first down Darryl Morris able to force him out as Williams runs is 420 again poor tackling watch number 56 that's gonna be Cushing and he's got to get over there but you got to keep that ball inside T he lets it back across his face along with other defenders you know pushing at the second level he's got to be the tackling machine playing behind going to the Texans that ball is out and it will be Houston football first were covered fumble of the season for the Texans and it was Jonathan Joseph able to pounce on the football yeah we said they had to run it keep it on the ground just to get out of here he blocked but forgot to say you also need to hold on to the football because turnovers is the only way the Texans are going to get back into this ball game turnovers and touchdowns for the Texas and the defense comes away with one there well Bill O'Brien have been waiting for any kind of positive contribution from his depressed and he finally gets it from Jonathan Joseph can fuse to just make this game respectable at this point on his first down pass for Nate Washington low and incomplete we go to New York in an update here's JB just hanging in it's a back and forth battle as advertised you're going to find Chris Ivory to the flash flow the uncontested scorer checks regain the lead 1716 in box mo Spiro and Solomon a lot of people wondering if the Jets would be up to the task and justify what they've done to this point they're playing very well great defense and a quarterback who can manufacture enough plays get the ball to his well his lawyer puts the man under at far side of the field it's caught that's Arian Foster inside the tent and that'll set up a first down for Houston as they pick up 21 yards and now they're down inside the red zone need to come away with some points good throw from Hoyer he had enough protection they were able to keep the pocket clean as he was able to throw that ball area fall you're his foster trying to cut his way back miss Amin you put this game behind them if foster consumer can continue to get healthy it just brings this offense back to what people expected it to be before the season and then of course the questions and the instability at quarterback well they need to be able to run the ball because of the instability at the quarterback position they're not as prolific there as they would like but they do have a playmaker and DeAndre Hopkins if they can get the run game when they'd have excellent balance second Gulf fighters and zone it is caught foster and finally Houston is on the board Jelani Jenkins was trying to cover Arian Foster which is very difficult he's just as the talented receivers he has a run a look at him outside 53 Jenkins gets no help to the outside and Foster was able to separate haul it in for a touchdown Boyer was looking at him being tired time because he knew he had the matchup he wanted Foster against the linebacker 7 yard touchdown reception second receiving score for Foster on the season and they have both come over the last couple of weeks so the Damian Williams fumble leads to Houston's first points and that's for the kind of day it's been for the Houston Texans the point after from Nick Novak is no good a wonderful cause that we've been talking about all month and tough to segue into this piece of news that we just heard a couple of minutes ago Flip Saunders was such a wellknown and respected figure in the NBA has passed away at the age of 60 you've been battling Hodgkin's lymphoma this is terrible news as a foot was supposed to be getting ready for the NBA season that just stunning news out of the NBA he'll be missed I remember meeting him once and many players I know love playing form 41 to 6 Miami as Houston finally did that again on the board after the touchdown catch by Eric Austin's Danny Williams at the table to that spin boost it's something you rarely see Oh is videogame like from Williams finally brought down by Eddy blessings after a 31yard return well JJ Watts kind of been limping around a bit once I was able to break through a moment ago for his first big play this is the previous Drive but you can see he's able to kind of hanging in there saw him leave the game momentarily earlier in the first half on Lamar Miller 85 yard touchdown run this is Jonas play bouncing off tacklers crosses the 35 out to the 40 15 yards and a Miami first down Justin Tuggle and Andre Howell on the tackle they're gonna run over to the left side JJ Watt jumping underneath that block he talked about it and that really allows them to have a gasp a gap right there on that defensive line he says he'll take calculated risks that time he gets long season earlier mom JJ Watt roasted ten dolphin so keep it on the ground mrs. gray promoted to Miami's active roster prior to their week three game against the bills that wild roller coaster of a rookie season he had last year in New England 200 yard performance week 11 and was late to practice a couple of weeks later and spent the rest of the season and Bill Belichick stuck out and learning experience right hopefully he has learned his lesson because he is a talented player and I think he can help his Miami Dolphins football team even though Lamar Miller is the primary guy but I think gray can add to their committee of running backs see the plain selection so far in half as they get to ten he'll again it's what he is turned it on he just made the play on that tackle then watch you come around starts at the top of your screen he just keeps working he out works the offensive lineman that come away with the sack gone Tannehill JJ Watt relentless what he say every time he comes to the ballpark there's some kid he knows is watching him for the first time he wants what's that kid to lead with the memory of him playing well well I was pumped up full of medications that Sunday was under the weather says it was not his best performance and you certainly expected him to respond today but unfortunately for he and the Texans it has come on a day in which they have been blown out penalty marker thrown behind the line of scrimmage holding offense number 51 that penalty is declined fourth down that's Mike Pouncy among the best centers in the NFL well if you're Bill O'Brien you see in some positive play at least from your defense first couple of minutes of the third quarter I think you want to see your player especially on defense you know hit hustle run and make sure tackles good things are gonna happen the ball will pop out on the fumble you will get sacks on the quarterback and create turnovers updated score from that cult Saints game 27 to nothing Indianapolis is losing so that would certainly minimize the damage of this game for Houston if the Texans are just one game back of the cuts and the AFC South excellent looking punt while Matt gar the rookie Brian Hoyer back onto the field when we come back well if you brought your sunscreen and an umbrella you're really thinking it through today I had some wild weather back and forth I've seen the heavens open up bright sunshine and as we play with under six to play now in his third quarter long throw to Nate Washington across the field first down and a lot more goodlooking throw from Hoyer as they pick up 23 forced out of bounds by Jamar Taylor goodlooking protection for Brian Hoyer allowed him to get rid of that ball and get it over to the boundary what Nate Washington was able to haul it in you can see the numbers at the top of your screen just incredible discrepancy between these two teams that's Washington again summon if you're a Texas fan how much of this do you put on the quarterback because they're always the easy target you know these games and when things don't go well but today it has been a breakdown really from from A to Z you know how we talk about complimentary football everyone pitching in when you're trying to win a game and this one this is complimentary as well everyone's pitched in had a hand in playing poorly there's foster little cutback maneuver inside Miami Territory all the way down to the 24 yard line Brent Grimes on the tackle and now foster certainly looked like his old shifty self yeah Boyer is going to get it to him we talked about it he is I think the magic advantage with the defensive back on it but if you get a linebacker on area foster go ahead and turn him loose and get him the football 26 yards on the catch and Ronnie gets a blow Alfred blue on the field go to class he went over the middle this is hot keys and a foot ball comes loose looks like the Texans are able to recover it was Garrett Graham falling on the football just inside that 15 yard line and sometimes you know even the great players you try to do to your own the catch and a fumble recovered by the offense second down just trying to do too much on that one from DeAndre Hopkins you're gonna make a catch here now you've just got to turn it up get as much as you can but you start jumping around and getting the ball away from your body they poked it out you're lucky Graham was able to follow football was forced out by Jelani Jenkins by the way here's custard but in breaking tackles getting to the outside appeared as though Olivier varnon had a chance out of the backfield 5yard run and a first down from Foster hey he's able to hit that first down he he's working hard you can see he's getting that elusive ability back into his game they would have make some guys miss still has that verse to get to the edge hit the corner now let's see if right in an i formation maybe they run it or go play out there will be offensive tackle can command as eligible whereas number 63 bursting goal this is being beaches close to the five and brought down at the six how many teams in the National Football League now are lining up in a tie formation with a true fullback like Jonathan Grimes and and half running the ball with great power its Israel the offensive game has changed over the years this is blue again picks up a half yard maybe a yard I don't see what they elect to do here on third and goal as foster comes back in some of these elements are starting to come back I believe this is the year of the running back you look at the teams that are running the ball with really good ball carriers where you can run it you got to play well I think Cincinnati Bengals are one of those teams they up T running backs that they use Marshawn Lynch and he gets it going again with Seattle you expect him to be back hit it I don't see a Boyer and certainly to down territory for Houston as a dominant shoe comes across early see if he was drawn offsides again our referee today is John Hussey this is on a rare mistake today by sue that is first to sex with his new team in the first half that time they went empty no one was in the backfield with Moyer and now they're going to come out again and they've got Arian Foster and DeAndre Hopkins to one side he can't double both of them then move it across preschool Buster decided back his way in touchdown one appeared to be a free play as varnon came across early foster into the end zone for the two yard touchdown smart play they started foster out aside that penalty is declined touchdown they motioned him back into the backfield Spiro and look we call it just running to the bubble here you can see the off sized by Olivier Vernon we talk about running to the bubble you're running a high our act that defensive lineman who doesn't have a linebacker behind them knowing that you can get a seam there and get your way into the end zone so foster who missed the first three games of the season with that devastating groin injury it was missed so much time over the last couple of seasons and a nice bounceback last year rushed for nearly 1300 yards starting to resemble his old self nick Novak's point after is good you're watching the NFL on CBS some of the notable passing leaders around the NFL Teddy Bridgewater at the top man Lamar Miller 85 yard touchdown run to punctuate his afternoon here against Houston what a day for Lamar Miller came out like gangbusters this is where it gets a little tricky for a team you build up a huge lead like they were up 41 nothing at halftime and on the challenge the Dan Campbell's think his team mentally in the game Houston playing for pride at this point who knows what was said in their locker room at halftime the Dan Campbell is not a coach who will just kind of sit idly by and watch this lead slowly start to get cut in two especially when you have been promoting amongst your team how to be competitive regardless of what the scoreboard says and whether you're down or whether you up I think you've got to still come out and continue to compete manonman just how you prepare then practice all week sant\u00e9 Hill fakes right boys under the rest this is Damian Williams Williams breaking a couple of tackles and brought down a 27 by cloudy and quick we had a fun time sitting with Campbell yesterday at their facility we asked them about this growing legend that he's basically nocturnal that he doesn't sleep so they laid in his hotel bed in Tennessee last Saturday night before the game called his wife talked her for about 45 minutes fell asleep woke up again at 3 a.m. and just some of the things he's been struggling with and what's been a world win a couple of weeks yeah he said you know there are some are the things that you know about coaching that's got nothing to do with football making decisions you know what we're gonna eat what time to leave our your flights and all those other things tell what by the way stone has not thrown an incompletion that's beyond since we're missed of a number of games with a concussion and Campbell is we got an injured player looks like Vince Wilfork is the injured Texan Houston trainers quickly come on at the field Norfolk the South Florida native grew up in Boynton Beach to about 40 miles from where we are here the good sign is will FERC will walk off on his own power and he built like an old battle that he had two three guys of black ale the other guys to be hurt like I fell on top of his eyes would look like pushing came and and hit him as he was attempting to make a tackle or hit on the ball care 11 years in a storied career with the Patriots twotime Super Bowl champ fivetime All Pro 10 defenses in the NFL this is Williams again little extra effort gets the first down crosses to 30 we'll see what the penalty call is here North the clock stopped 225 seconds holding yard penalty third down that's true on James their second near tackle and former firstround pick out of Tennessee had a nice look play going there they allowed JJ Watt to come up the field unblock when do you ever see watt going unblocked look at the top of the screen watch he'll run right by OC you turn them loose in the shovel pass underneath it and if Williams drops that ball it's just going to be an incomplete and pass that play is more of a forward pass but again they left JJ Watt unblocked and that time they in a rare occasion was able to fool him on the play dolphins will let the final 17 seconds come off the clock so the Houston Texans down 41 nothing at halftime actually score the only points of that third quarter but a lot more uphill road to hoe for Bill O'Brien and a Texas end of the third quarter we'll return to Miami after this message and a word from your local station you're watching the NFL on CBS Ryan Tannehill from the shotgun as we begin the fourth quarter Spiro D to Solomon wilcott so entire CBS crew from Miami Dolphins led 41 nothing just join us 13 unanswered by the Texas so that point was join us play in the bench plus is the 25 within is meant by a number of defender ease needed to 30 well short as they pick up 9 through the air how about Ryan Tannehill remaining perfect 16 for 16 in this game come on played well but you have to give the offensive coordinator build laser head coach Dan Campbell a lot of credit what they're doing what Ryan Tannehill four touchdown passes on the day he couldn't play any better but they're giving him a game plan that's allowed him I think we get into early rhythm early throws bubble screens and still produce big plays in the office santa Hills stumbling to the points four weeks of the season really could say the same for this entire offense that breakout performance last week in the land more than carrying over here in a week number seven 50 yard punt 14 on a return from Humphrey on CBS happy to have you still with us 41:13 early stages fourth quarter here in Miami and foster crossing the end zone on a rushing and receiving touchdown tackled on the play by Bobby McCain the rookie 5th Ron pickle hadn't played much before today told you about some of the injuries that they have had to contend with Bryce McCain out with a knee injury so a chance for Bobby to get some run primarily a special teams player till this point for the fifth round pick out of Memphis wire has some time second for answers quiet it's Chris Pope 1st down on the reception just short of the 15 this Bureau you would think that with guys like Bobby McCain coming in tomorrow Taylor then boy you're in this offense with DeAndre Hopkins would have been able to take advantage of price became being out today but they have not been able to do that their litmus passrush from that front floor you'll spoil your on first down slings over the middle head inside dolphins territory back to New York in an update with JP and the city showing some moxie yes Alex Smith's gonna drop back and find Chris Connolly for the six are scored yes Chris a Leo receiver Kansas City up 23:13 hopefully Spiro and Solomon won't get on me above the word moxie bar back to Spiro JB Spiros got moxie favorite words everywhere spoke inside the 40 down to the 38 yard line and that'll be another Houston Texans first now I know what JB means the Millennials they don't use that word moxie they call it swag I've always liked that word is it swag or moxie we had Moxie before this game started yeah even during the day if they only knew right 41 to 13 does that pass from lawyers picked off there was a penalty market the elements like a Thomas to safety Thomas crosses into Houston territory it appeared as though Derrick Shelby may have come across early offsides defense number 79 fiveyard penalty first down that is in fact Shelby on the penalty okay I'm at the top of the screen he jumps right there so warrior knows he can take a shot down the field at DeAndre Hopkins you know Thomas makes him pay for Shelby just took the play away from his defense one injury update from the Houston side Hakeem dent one of their starting linebackers has a hamstring injury his returning is questionable this poelker won't set back on first and five that passed on behind grab and falls incomplete and Hoyer's difficulties with his tight ends continue yeah that wall was on Hoyer you know he's got to put it out in front of Graham you know that one was behind Graham and had Graham just tipped that one up it would have been intercept not a single catch in this game from 80 Houston's tight ends Fedora Woodson Graham second down that pass intended for Washington is incomplete Boyer now 16 of 38 for a buck 82 and highly inaccurate throwing the ball that ball could have been intercepted it was high and behind his intended receiver Nate Washington take a look at Ryan Mallett the resting on the bench will not the best 24hour period in Ryan Mallett Houston Texans career just the bystander third and five lawyer buyers nearside leaders caught inside the 30 and that'll be enough for a first down for those fans wondering ye we haven't seen Ryan Mallett we told you earlier he missed the team charter here yesterday paid his own way flew commercially got here last night is active but that only out of necessity saw him and no other healthy backup quarterbacks on the roster yeah you have to wonder had he been on the team playing the way boy you're got off to a slow start boy one of his first team pass attempts head mallet not come into the ballgame on force to ten warriors pass the aside he's caught that's Washington stays inbounds and he crosses the goal line first touchdown reception for Nate Washington as a Houston Texan 27 yards from Hoyer well it's just a simple out route by Nate Washington's he he's gonna be here and he'll come and he's working against Jamar Taylor but Taylor takes a poor angle you got to go top side of that show to not come underneath like that because now you don't have a way to get to the ball or make the tackle if you miss just poor angle defensively by Jamar Taylor good play by Nate watch Taylor and his third year out of Boise State former secondround pick here in 2013 only his fourth career started or the injury to Bryce McCain no that's point after is good so the Houston Texans 20 unanswered twice 41 to 20 on CBS well some of the great images of the Miami Dolphins in this franchise that perfect season only team to win a Super Bowl with a perfect season 3rd season they're the National Football League at that point only their 7th season in franchise history and a year of football that they'll be talking about here till the end of time 41 to 20 20 unanswered points by the Houston Texans who are down in this game at halftime 41 to nothing oh never missed a moment of football action with the CBS Sports app every play and score every game and every highlight right as they happen download the CBS sports app now at CBS sports.com slash mobile there's a bill excuse me bill laser the offensive coordinator for the Miami Dolphins to see what they've done here in the second half so when you add the punt in three of your four possessions in the second half you say to yourself okay let's get something going let's get back on track Tannehill goes playaction puts a now under it and that pass is incomplete if you've just joined us as we got a late marker now in the backfield is Tannehill took the hit contact to the head and neck area 15 yards automatic first down learning moment for the second year cloudy you know led with a helmet hit the quarterback yeah you have to let her know we can't do that in the National Football League this is what Joe his head coach Bill O'Brien talked about he just needs more experience needs to be on the field more it's missed a lot of playing time with injuries during his first two seasons he might be fractured under surgery last December finally get himself healthy his Jonas Gray Ross is 35 and forced out of bounds by max Bullough just join us Ryan Tannehill and this game 23 consecutive completions in a row that dates back to last week that made new franchise record for Miami Tannehill today 16 of 16 that's what you call economical yeah there's no doubt and you know he's come under criticism early in the season so he needed a game like has to kind of validate that new contract in order to him this off see more penalty markers thrown jennings coming over in the off season sign that free agent deal to reunite at least initially with Joe Philbin his old offensive coordinator in Green Bay holding offense number eighty ten yard penalty second down that's Deon Simms the third year tight end out of Michigan State revealed laser you saw on that past their Spiro it's just a quick little bubble screen something quick get the ball in the flat these are easy completions that's why I Tannehill is going 16 416 the fact that he's executing them he's not putting the ball in harm's way but bill laser has given his quarterback a game plan that he can execute and still allows the offense to be productive it has to be bittersweet couple of weeks forgo laser when we seen this offense start to perform much better but it's going to expensive as my exboss Joe Philbin fired and also his colleague Kevin Coyle is also here a couple of weeks back Brent Jennings with his first two catches of the year and make it 24 consecutive completions for Tannehill that one 4:23 maybe he's throwing it down the field great block by Dion Sims too tight in picking up cloudy coming in from the blindside it buys time for this quarterback cameo hit that ball over to Greg Jennings so the protection is held up and helped him to complete those 24 straight passes phenomenal really good job it's highs Donovan McNabb for the alltime NFL record he has spread the wealth is just so different players have to pass is caught and a new NFL record it's Jordan Cameron 11 yards on the pass from chana Hill Jordan Cameron you see him right side of your screen he had to work to get this one for Tannehill but give 10 he'll credit cuz he was out on the move running from JJ Watt still put that ball where Jordan Cameron could haul it in little pieces three for Lyon town 25 straight completions in gorgeous week six in seven of new NFL record one here with the lawn Miller his afternoon over so Tannehill moves past this band former Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb November of 2004 24 straight completions to set the league record Connecticut on his last 10 passes in that game against the Giants and then a week later completed his first 14 in game against the Packers Tannehill former 8th overall pick Texas native warning lovin through all the big swing taking on his hometown team with him in week number seven this is not the first time this year Salomon that we've seen the Texans blown out you go back to that Atlanta game it's just been such a fluctuation with this team week to week last week they look so good granted it can with the offense of a a Jacksonville team that struggled just hard to explain yeah and I'm sure Bill O'Brien is searching for answers because you know Romeo Crennel is a really good defense coordinator you know Bill O'Brien is a good head coach I think we got a good glimpse of that during the Hard Knocks episode this summer but for some reason or another this isn't clicking not coming together I think deficiencies at the quarterback position has really hurt him as well first incompletion you saw and heard the reaction from the fans as Deon Simms was the intended receiver so Tannehill now 18 of 19 he put it right on go up with two hands and not one now Simms is a tight end I think he's better suited as an inline blocker at six for 270 not as nearly as nimble and athletic as Jordan camera only the second field goal attempts for Andrew clanks last threeplus games this one has the distance from 53 and it is good from the rookie impressivelooking hoot from Andrew Franks after the Dolphins drive stalls Barna Gary the rest of our CBS crew will have that call 44 to 20 this almost isn't fair at this point the quarterback comparison and he's an incredible discrepancy Psalm and right down the list yeah it has and you could see widely productive offensive players for the Miami Dolphins and anemic numbers for the Houston Texas andrew Franks disputed a 53yard field goal that one through the back of the endzone his Brian Hoyer and company come back on to the field again if you're a Texans fan as hard as this has been to watch the fact that the cults are about to lose to the Saints certainly lessons that the sting of this defeat at least on the standing sheet but there's so much to talk about this week as they will start Lee slowly start to look ahead to Tennessee next week damn Campbell's got to get his team ready for a Thursday night game against the New England Patriots that'll be a real test for lawyer goes play action on first et that passes thoughts on Nate Washington who did not play in the last two games with a hamstring injury now starting to to pad his numbers in garbage time 22 yards in a first down and Jamar Taylor the cornerback for the Miami Dolphins got to figure it out they're starting to come after him Nate Washington has over a hundred yards receiving in the game most have come here in the second half away the Washington it's a second 100yard if we see the game as a Texan there's another penalty marker throwing Washington had that stellar debut in the opener before going down with a hamstring injury pictures on a fraction defense number 91 fiveyard penalty first down that's Cameron wake you know defensive players they always talk about getting the lead playing with a lead stop the run get the lead then we get to rush the quarterback well their agents now to get sacks get into the quarterback we had a chance to sit with Wade yesterday saman he has some of the biggest arms I think I've ever ever seen he's like a when Adonis chiseled at a rock what a defensive player he's been it finally looks like his old self after the hamstring had slowed him down the first four weeks he is a hard worker he puts the work in and he expects to have high levels of production at last pass was tipped by Adama katsu and here he comes away with the tackle Alfred blue on the carry SUEZ had himself a really good ballgame today no we talked to Dan Campbell he says you know I sat down and talked to him diamond Cotuit say hey you just tell me what's been going on with you he wanted to disappear I'm out and Dan Campbell has a former player he can appreciate that sometimes players just want to be heard they need someone to listen and he was like okay we're gonna allow you to do some things but you know we want you to work within our structure and then down the kazuya could tell he's bought in because the performance he put on here today he's been able to hit her in her ass the quarterback digging out ball carriers in the midst of that line of scrimmage being able to come away with a couple of sacks today where he got him on consecutive plays so he's been relentless he's worked hard and then highly productive today five hits on the quarterback couple of sacks lady well and some when you think to how Jim Washburn was using him in Detroit the Lions defensive coordinator moving him around giving him the freedom to kind of use his very high football IQ so give Pam Campbell credit for sitting him down and getting input from one of his star defensive players the second straight week therefore my shotgun is third employees quite by Hopkins quiet day for Hopkins only is fifth ket's tackled by Brent Grimes to New York and JB patriots precision Tom Brady drops back and finds rob bukowski wide open for the 15yard touchdown it's Gronkowski 60th touchdown of his career New England up 30 20 just textbooks Bureau and Solomon I still wonder how does Brock get that widel I'm sure a lot of jets pants I mean we're asking that same question you cover him coming out of the huddle Samus is afraid he's just the machine at this point it's just it's unbelievable what he's done you can count on your hand the amount of division losses in his career at home as it looks like they're going to beat the Jets home to play every single with the six movie watch second India's foster twining it downhill inside the 35 close to the 33 a run of eleven and a Texas first down his love the way that area falls to Ron's so patient and to sort of collides people just slide off of him there he didn't pick the tackle as well laya Martha's coming roadsides the field maybe a free play for a foyer completes to Keith mumphrey and now the officials wide give the penalty number 93 that penalty is declined he's all for the play first down so mumphrey with his first catch 16 yards and a first down you see the entire defensive line they would bring it all of them out there a little bit exhausted sort of a shift change for the defensive front we spoke one of with the Dhamma consumed when we were here last month talking about the transition coming from Detroit here to South Florida first time that he's played his home games in warm climates Houston keeps it on the ground inside the 15 that's a foster close to the 13 yard line it's always such a transition you spent five years in your career in one city pick up your family and it's been a transition but after a rough start looks like Sue's starting to play like his old self ready to play and change schemes as well where they're asking you to do things maybe a little bit differently that can I think take some time to adjust as well boy on 2nd and 5 looking endzone and incomplete the other miss didn't think about sue is that you know you talked to him side you have a picture of him in your mind because of all the things that have happened you see though the ferociousness on the field people have called him a dirty player in the past but he comes across so differently in person such a thoughtful guy and such a bright guy very bright very bright very intelligent very instinctive and that's why the coaches said yeah we'll listen to him he's here now some of his suggestions who were good ones some of them worked so good but he's got to be able to accept that as well and I think if you're sue you what always maintain the presence where you're comfortable that you can work with coaches to play well take some parts more shine jogs as physical as safety as we have in the NFL he's a star player there's no doubt in my mind I think he's one of those safeties that maybe we don't talk enough about him but I think now playing behind this defensive front the stars they have on this defense cam wake and Dhamma can suit Brent Grimes I think people are going to find out about with Sean Jones I think he's on his way to a Pro Bowl I already had another touchdown today after getting an intercept first and goal don't talk about them simplifying the defense of my daddy's help as we see another drop from a Houston receiver that's Nate Washington looks like an injured Texan on the field of oil that's Arian Foster my goodness well he just takes a step and it's as if his leg gives out watching coming toward you in the screen as he takes off after snap right there just gave out on him and he appears to be in a lot of pain there you see him in motion look right there just gave out something popped and it's you know he's been one of the best players since 2009 when he had his first touchdown against the Miami Dolphins we scored more touchdowns than any other player in the league since then very simply when he has been healthy he was one of the best allaround running backs in the NFL hands down but just cannot seem to catch a break with these injuries we hope that he's okay second and goal Chris Hulk is the lone setback Ezequiel let's lawyer closed enzone caught Nate Washington for the touchdown second receiving score for Washington the 11th year fit as he beats Bobby McCain like they're making it look easy here in the second half is there than a card off Arian Foster but it's gonna be on the left side of your screen against Bobby McCain 28 Nate Washington beats him for a touchdown third passing touchdown from Hoyer and the second is an eighth Washington so the obvious concern as Foster is parted into the locker room where his pass on the twopoint attempt is deflected by Derrick Shelby and he can just hope that that injury to Foster's ankle not as serious as it looks fortyfour to twentysix worth four minutes to play in this fourth quarter reminder coming up on the subway postgame show we'll send you to New York JB and the guy is standing by they'll get to the latest scores and highlights as week 7 continues all next on the subway postgame show you can expect an onside kick here Sparrow from the Texans they're still in it four minutes to go you can get the ball here get yourself a quick score it's Nick Novak who was bounced around the NFL cut by the San Diego Chargers at the end of the preseason missed an extra point earlier but he could have toned for that year was a goodlooking onside kick dan Campbell sends out his hands unit and here comes know that little trickery on that back foot on sidekick that's one you don't see very often or it barely matriculated ten yards down the field which is required before the kicking team can recover injured Miami Dolphin is Damien Williams the man who recovered the football was Michael Thomas who had that interception negated earlier due to a penalty now one thing you don't want to see ever especially in a game that has been long decided his injuries and we're just so Arian Foster carted off the field of injury to his lower left leg and now it's Damian Williams where you saw take a shot unexpectedly on that play from Eddie pleasant and saman as you know you just kind of get the wind knocked out of you especially when it's coming from a direction that you didn't see he's gonna be able to walk off and that's a good thing and we've just been told it is an Achilles injury for Arian Foster and if you're a Texans fan immediately though the worst thing comes into your mind yet you're hoping it's a it's not as bad as we think it may be Tannehill his day is over 18 of 19 was Tannehill 282 and the four touchdowns on a day that he sets a new NFL record 24 consecutive completions going back to last week well he should feel good about himself he should feel good about this offense and his football team in a way that build laser is using some of the talent around them those talented wide receivers the Jarvis Landry Kenny steals Rashad Mathews Devante Parker even got into the act today he's got a couple of tight ends and Jordan Cameron and Deon Sims that if this offensive line could continue to block like they have in the run game over the last two weeks Dolphins office take off and as Jonas Gray finding the seam on the outside inside the 25 close to the 20 as the clock continues to run nice play by greatest and bounce 16 yards and a Miami first down good move by Grabow can't say enough about their ability to run the football right Miami Dolphins 254 yards rushing today Tannehill 18 of 19 do you want to keep those numbers going and complete a high percentage of your passes you run the ball the way they did today 254 incredible you saw the record 25 consecutive completions as great and is brought down right after the take JJ Watt who has two SEC's and this game Houston will burn a timeout one more reminder coming up the subway postgame show JB Bart bluemark coach Cowher standing by in New York busy day around the NFL will tell you about that finish in New England between the Jets and the Patriots all coming up on a subway postgame show summon are you slowly starting to become a believer or is this simply be the case of Miami getting themselves right against two teams that have really been struggling in Jacksonville and Houston I'm a believer simply because this is a team coming into 2015 you felt had the talent to play well you felt particularly on the defensive side of the ball they could dominate at the line of scrimmage they can make blaze on the back end all dan Campbell did was tap into that and draw out of them the talent that's there that for some reason or another was being held back during their first four or five games of the season there's Matt Moore on in relief of Tannehill completes this is Greg Jennings Jennings close to the 10 Houston out of timeouts unable to stop it first down and that should take us to the twominute warning second straight lopsided victory for Miami's interim head coach Dan Campbell hard to believe that after all the hiccups early in the season the Dolphins are two minutes away from getting themselves to 500 you're watching the NFL on CBS updated look at the standings New England has defeated the Jets so they get to 6 and OH Jets now torn to Miami as soon as this one ends we'll get to 3 and 3 Buffalo a loser earlier today that game was played in London against Jacksonville special thanks to our entire crew here our producer Ryan Gavin Andy Goldberg our director and the rest of our fabulous crew Ilana Campbell a day Ellis Stefan flora Val Adam Collin also Wayne Richardson in the truck our statistician rust a linen our spotter rich gainer what a difference a couple of weeks make for the Miami Dolphins anyone who walked out of the stadium here after that week three loss to the Buffalo Bills certainly concerned dejected from what they had seen from this team and had such high expectations before the season and now Dan Campbell 60 plus seconds away from getting his team out of twoandoh since he's taken over run again real though we got teams like Patriots coming up Cowboys got Jets coming up maybe the toughest match and team to prepare for Solomon on a short week as they're ready for the Patriots Thursday no no Belichick I have his guys but they're so damn Bono is he's got his work cut out for him but they're gonna enjoy the ride lead time for the Houston Texas the obvious emotions from losing a game in this fashion and then to make it worse Arian Foster carted off the field with a left Achilles injury in a closing couple of minutes Ryan Tannehill 18 of 19 nearly perfect didn't throw it in completion too late in that fourth quarter as the Miami Dolphins gets a three and three with a second straight convincing win in as many weeks the legend of Dan Campbell continues 44 to 26 your final number sobbing woodcuts an entire Krause girl dataset so long Haley you've been watching the NFL on CBS home of Super Bowl 50 coming up the subway

  "transcript": "tonight's firsthalf highlights are brought to you by the Chevy Silverado shitty silver highstrength steel for highstrength dependability 2120 Indianapolis what's taking place over the first half tonight 20 Tom Brady 201 yards that interception that was returned by Adams for a touchdown was his first pick of the season Andrew Luck playing for the first time in three weeks he saw his numbers Gronkowski has been thrown to only once and he's been shutouts at this point Mike Adams has now picked radio up three times in his career twice last year and once tonight it was seven nothing Indy than it was ten seven New England as the second half begins there was 14 ten Indianapolis 17:14 New England and II took the lead by four and thence one at the hand quarterbacks with two great quarterbacks and they put on a show right away this fourth down throw huge to get the Colts out of the gate and then Tom Brady showing off a little bit of his mobility he really created some nice offense the one turnover the first half completely not Brady's fault none just unable to hold on to that one and now watch the spy of Jamie Collins underneath and Andrew Watkins his eyes up the field and tremendous firsthalf great quarterback with the ball to start the third quarter and they start with the first down here day me and medulla that's a gain of 11 yards one thing you just don't see a lot of is to see these guys dropping their pass rushers underneath and coverage but they're trying to take away all those in cuts that if the New England Patriots beat everybody with so they're trying to have somebody inside and sort of it inviting that to the outside now and maybe Brady has found something here too started early going back is granted for the passionate Affairs the offensive pass interference had cost himself a touchdown at the end of the half demon 25 pressure is going to come around the edge one more time watch out calmly Brady steps up gets underneath Trent Cole and makes yet another play we have seen Tom Brady and one of the differences in this game so far for him on offense is his extending plays within the pocket then able to find guys down the field find something every year to work on 16 years in this year LeGarrette Blount Deena one so many times the Patriots want to pull those guards out in front of plays but if they get tripped up they can just stymie the running back trying to make a move that time is Jackson came across we got pushed in the backfield second down and nine no cannon in the game the left tackle you get offended and as you two tackles taking it to the 40yard line only his second carry of the night but once again or the Patriots once they get in this third and five range so when you get those third down runs you see opportunity now for Tom Brady third down and six Grady goes to the right side and finally gets Gronkowski so a very quick look to the left and Ron Kowski makes his first catch of the night white Lowry is the guy that they thought was the best option for them to cover Gronkowski he's a former cornerback and yet he's a big strong guy about 215 pounds and you see him playing off most teams feel like that if you go up and bump and run Robb Kowski it is to his advantage so they're playing off of them and trying to react out Blake Lockett one miss Brady gets the snap Louis eat of about five we go to Michelle well cold safety Mike Adams is not on the field questionable with a hamstring injury he had that interception of Tom Brady in the first half he is on the sideline a towel around his neck just looking very frustrated wishing he were out there out hmm that's a big loss Michelle Colt Anderson is a great special teams guy Anderson is in the game down in Adams spot second down and five at the 25yard line you couldn't hold them back next monomers Gronkowski for the touchdown I can't even tell you what happened on that coverage completely blown there's nobody in here will know to quell Jackson was supposed to drop underneath that but had absolutely no chance that Dwight Lowry just blowing that's just wrong shredder until then Adams out of the game we mentioned that the lost their key guy in the secondary Gronkowski catches his first two passes of the game and again the Patriots pull off that's scoring at the end of the first half and scoring to begin the second half to back possessions just asking is good and about four minutes in duty another lead change is savage to Patriots on top by sex this is Sunday night Gronkowski targeted just once in the first half take a look at him through the years when he plays they average almost 33 points again highest average for any player who's played a minimum 50 G's vitamin T Smith the LA Rams back in the late 40s and early 50s would be the next highest Sunday night wouldn't be a good nickname these days I talked to Chuck Pagano at half time he likes what Andrew loves done saying he's done pretty good darn good for a guy who hasn't played for a couple of weeks we have been here before with the Patriots this time we have to finish now an update on Marcus cannon the left half before the Patriots he's been downgraded to out with that left toe injury al that had him questionable in the first half all right Thank You Michele so it'll still be Ballmer and Fleming and the Patriots who used to it mixing and matching tasting and Lloyd 20yard line Jamie Collins with the batted ball second down to ten Jamie Collins is just so nimble so many times his change of direction almost looks like the way a cornerback would do it just reading the eyes of Andrew Luck and knocking that one away I will say though that the one guy in this Colts offense that had a really nice first half was Anthony Costanzo playing against Chandler Jones he is that's a tough matchup and he's sigh but it's a bouncing bill look at that matchup Anthony Costanzo and Chandler Jones who probably their best pure pass rusher on the team and those two guys have been going out at Gaston Zoe's except arrays for doing exactly what you're seeing on the screen Sherlock has been pretty comfortable tonight his backs have done a nice job blocking and he has gotten some pressure he's escaped and made some nice plays out of it you know the offensive lineman's having a good night when he can't remember calling the name of the guy he's playing against and he's out of bounds yard line Malcolm Butler made sure he went no farther and that's going to bring in the punting group well pressure on Andrew Luck and he had to get it out of there that time he got hit right in the chops as he let that one go Pat McAfee to punt Julian Edelman that a touchdown this located his finger at least it looked like a dislocation three drops back to accept this punt last moment mr. Boyd at the 28 yard line and he says he was contacted he go for it update on some of the numbers the Colts doing a better job against New England on the ground but they've given up three 273 through the air the 342 already for New England up by six Patriots have the ball at their own 26 out there again and just looked at taken but they're going to say the play was over I'm not so sure about this one Colt Anderson came in to make the hit after Lowry was there with him Gronkowski makes another catch again elbow down wall out as the ball moving before nots good call all came out Adams Patriots making sure with the Lewis picking up three down to the 44 here's one of those rookies we're talking about Henry Anderson inside playing off that doubleteam he has made a lot of plays in the backfield for this Colts defense so far this season second and seven at the patriot forty fear tended for Dion Lewis 337 and here is what bregman husky the defensive coordinator for the Colts has been waiting for one of these third and seven plus and whatever is his best blitz coverage whatever it is this is his moment and his defense needs to get off the field you can't let this juggernaut keep rolling along crowd knows that too they stand as one seven that's incomplete Chandler looks for a flag doesn't get one Tola with very good coverage fourth down sometimes you just have to win oneonone that's all there is to it reaches around knocks that ball out a little contact which I think the hand hit the ball before it really hit one of the arms good play New England's first punt of the night Ryan Allen to receive it and it's a bad kick with the sign of his foot it squirts out of bounds up around the 24 yard line so the Kofi does its job offense takes over down by six these guys would be lifers Dick LeBeau 57 seasons on the field as a coach or a player now with the Titans dick folks um in two years with the Steelers 45 years Charlie Joyner great player coach as well 44 years course Don Shula spent 43 seasons coaching her playing Bill Belichick did not play in the National Football League 41 years in coaching and he hasn't missed any of them since he started on to Ted marchibroda from the 24 grunting holding offense number 74 first down so we're talking about a trick last night and Leon Costanza we asked him about did you ever need a break or walk away and he coach the Browns head coach before Cleveland moved to Baltimore he said at that point in 1996 I sort of did but Bill Parcells was coaching New England he brought me in to help him on the defensive side obviously that's when Bob Kraft got to know Belichick that one year then Belichick goes with Parcells to the Jets and of course Bill winds up after turning down the Jets job having it for a day with New England I think he was actually excited not to be a coordinator or a head coach and got a chance to take to the 22yard line he started with the Colts as an assistant there's some of the Baltimore Colts coaching staff for the areas with Ted marchibroda he made 25 bucks a week 22 after taxes he told us today would be about eight I tell you second down and 12 at the 22 yard line maskull once in over no shortage for my second tale outside the 40yard line bikie why Hilton for a first down so they overcome the the hold and call first down halfway through the quarter now there we go but watch Chandler Jones drop underneath this it almost went right through his hands Jones dropped an interception last week and I thought this one might have been picked off it sort of just went right between his hands from the 42 am on Bradshaw now in the game at running back fifty and a flag is down on the other side of the field away from the play illegal contact defense number 23 fiveyard penalty automatic first down Belize's Patrick Chung let's go back to that previous play here in Chandler Jones watches he drops underneath this CB he gets a hand on this think he did you can see the way that the ball started wobbling nice job by T Y Hill T in traffic stay focused and make that catch a lot of zone defense out here tonight I just I really didn't expect it I thought they were going to try and take away T Y hunting but maybe the respect of the other receivers this year so first down but isn't that the Patriots in the past whatever you expect you don't get you don't expect to get yeah and and really the the two things that they had to do differently this year they had to improve their defensive line play talking about the Colts to try and match up with this football team and they had to get better at the wide receiver position because they were able to take away twhite Hilton so they draft Phillip Dorsett they signed Andre Johnson and now they're getting a more balanced look from Matt Patricia left outside empty backfield incomplete Andre Johnson had a chance to make the catch couldn't hold on third down and nine just a little bit behind all the way inside gonna go across here and you'll see Andre Johnson slow down just a bit to give Logan Ryan a chance to get back in there well done by Logan Ryan who continues his hot play off of last week Johnson caught one ball on the opening drive and none Finch today they've got the speedster in there now Phillip Dorsett number 15 solutely fly he was their number one draft choice all the way back on the deep deep drive easily and Jo's converge for the sack and that'll make it fourth down on a mile Dominick easily with this quick first step of his is so tough for sinners who have to snap that ball look at how they've spread that out they tried to fan out but it left the centered collet Holmes oneonone and that time Easley was just too much every week you see a little bit something better out of Dominic Easley with that first step in his quickness with his fortyeight at the 10yard line bye Amendola district 2 yard kick five minutes to go on the corner here undefeated season beat cathedral 7nothing and friday night check it off underneath trying to get it to change white first time he's been in tonight polar for the beverage nice job out here you're going to have this out cut again that they hit earlier in the game but that was that trap coverage Vontae Davis rolled off of his guy Brady took a look and then stepped out of it sometimes as quarterbacks the throws you don't make are the best McGarrett walked in the backfield bassant ended therefore Keshawn Martin that makes it third down and ten with pressure right up here by the new guy ey McGill looky he got off and got in Brady's face which forced that high throw crowd again rising is one third down and ten so at the slip screen after a gain of seven by Colt Anderson taking the spot of the shaken up Mike Adams who was out to its fourth down what a huge tackle on this one I think he's right here watch Colt Anderson come up and make this play it looked like Amendola the punt returner who always makes people miss was going to end up with the first down there and that was a very special tackle by Colt Anderson and second on his first his off the side of his foot 32 yards the flag is class come around the corner what you know it's gonna be it's gonna be against the receiving team once the guy just could not help himself nope just could not help himself flying down the field clearly behind his man and just pushed him right in the back that was a 56 yard kick right there with some added yardage Buitoni crunchy gives us the call course nobody blocks Matthew Slater one of the great great special teams players in this league during the return of the kick illegal block in the back receiving team number 27 10yard penalty first down 356 left in the third quarter Patriots up 70 this drive starts at the 19yard the Patriots defensive end jabal shirt was questionable with an ankle injury we saw trainers examining his right ankle in the first half he's on the sideline no helmet and a pretty heavy tape job under that right sock out yeah and he michelle has been a significant addition and picked him up in the offseason from the Cleveland Browns leads his team in sacks and has proven what he can do inside something we really didn't do with the Browns second down and four five first down up at the 30yard line since they made the switch on this offensive line it has just been a huge difference they took Jack Newhart from right tackle moved him back in guy right here is going to make the block and then they brought back hugh thornton to play the right guard position but joe rights at right tackle we saw him last week against JJ Watt now yes he had a lot of help and all of that but he solidified that right tackle position that they used to have to leave it tied in on that side in order to pass protect no more with Wright 72 yards to the 37 yard line so Frank is not pickup 79 on 13 carries we're starting to see now the Patriots react a little bit to that running game by bringing some of the safeties down a notch and forcing him to get involved because remember one time in Andrew Luck's career is he had a hundred yard rusher and so the Patriots aren't used to seeing this out of them second and four with over two minutes to play in the third just past the line of scrimmage first two games that offensive line Chris was talking about it those were your starters the Todd Herman's coming over from Philadelphia they struggled made the change at guard you heard over two left guard Thornton the right guard rights to right tackle that was the big problem with Indy last year Chris both both lines the offensive line and the defensive warning they are better that they need to finish a game like this against the Patriots they have to stay on the field here with this third down three exploring the fascism Donte Moncrief was surrounded by a passel of white shirts in his fourth town he had it just let it sail along see Jamie Collins drift this way and it's going to lock once he scrambles the Thornton would have been a big first down you just wonder sometimes with that shoulder and you're not able to practice all those throws oh oh yeah three take the snap Anderson is behind you tell me I thought maybe they were going to try and get them to jump offsides illegal formation the whole right side of the line was not on the line of scrimmage offense this penalty is declined the result of the play is first now new there is absolutely no way possible that they should have snapped that ball and tried to stick it there were three four five guys around two players that was insane what are you doing here they don't even try to run a play i we see bizarre stuff I've never seen anything more bizarre than that what was the plan I don't know I mean two completely nuts but the 35 now search me for yard line McGarrett want nobody had any idea was going on it had to be a complete screwup I mean it's the only explanation you don't snap the ball with all these guys look at all these guys that's five on two and they didn't have enough guys on the line you have to have at least seven players on the line so they were fanned out on the right side and this is LeGarrette Blount we're in the final minute of the third quarter did I tell you the other thing it's not fair to your defense you know you get up there and in plays like that they're looking around I think Grif Whalen just said why the heck did you snap me the ball gold I didn't want that thing but it was Anderson who played the quarterback role Whelan was the snapper nobody was on the line not enough guys were on the line well just when you think you've seen law but that could be disaster at the end of the night 2721 into three and Sunday night football as wacky as it is just when you think you've seen everything Tomic man is the special team sport it's obviously that's a play that you're practice but clearly they didn't want him to snap it watch Chuck slips why'd you snap it he says second down and nine and now LeGarrette Blount will take the ball to the 20yard line setting up a third down and six exactly right I mean it just sometimes the coaches will say alright let's go out there if you get this look go ahead snap the ball there's just one guy snap the ball block in but if you don't get that look you can't snap the boat and top them up I'm gonna snap it to begin with you don't know the right number of guys on the line sediments laughter illegal formation which they were third and six and he's able to find enough space to pick up the first down at the 13 yard line it is so nice to have a guy on your team so the Tom Brady doesn't always have to throw the ball in that situation josh mcdaniels over calling the plays it was interesting here in tom talked about josh mcdaniels and how he weights up at 3 o'clock in the morning on Saturday morning to finalize the game plan so when Tom comes in he's nice and rested and we just ease his way through attention for a short game now from sometimes you get that look coming off the field we've had it several times when I played and as an offense when you make a screwup or you do something dumb or you gave up special teams play like that and that defense that's been fighting their tails off all night and getting the ball back to you here in the second half and all those things they just look at you like you said something about their family and that could take the air out of the room if the Patriots lined up in the endzone second and eight touchdown LeGarrette Blount so the trickery and deceit that went nowhere winds up on the other side as in New England touchdown and a twopossession lead I think I'm watching Aaron Rodgers tonight watch Brady step pressure to to create big plays the night when he's been under pressure and when he's been forced out of the pocket has been something we simply did not see at a Tom Brady a year ago he focused on it and he is delivering on promises right now the Garrett one and his career has 29 rushing touchdowns that is his first receiving TD this aspie adds the extra point and all of a sudden a very tight backandforth game as a 13point differential go figure go 48 to play in regular Auggie lovers like Chris and me know about Wednesday night robbery every Wednesday on NBCSN Philadelphia and Boston the Flyers and the Bruns meet in Boston this Wednesday night awesome utensil we can tell you that Sunday Night Football being brought to you by the Ford f150 every other truck is history by Microsoft Surface the official tablet of the NFL and by Geico 50 Minister City 50% on car insurance 20,000 artifacts house with the children's quite a deal here in Indianapolis here in town inde begins this draw Morrigan Jamie Collins I think scared him to death he threw it inside and Jamie Collins right here is going to be sitting right there in the space and his Moncrief came over there he looked at and just sort of collapsed but I think I lived as though another shot right there a nice job of getting T Y Hilton on the ground as well by the rookie Justin : second and ten then it's active the 60 unit Chandler Jones Silverson lingo revolt there and this was part of the problem holding offense number 76 this penalty has been declined results of the play third down so right make it third down and 14 one of the things that pep Hamilton was talking about was I have to call plays that get the ball out of Andrew Luck's hands and now that they're down he is reverting back to a little bit of what we saw early in the season when it's not there he wants to hold it and make a play flag down the team wide open 74 10yard penalty repeat third down anthony Costanzo a killer there's the matchup we've been talking about on the outside a little tug of the Jersey and little help from Chandler Jones on the call but that is a monster because that was a great play by T Y Hilton there and this this holding stuff really hurt the Colts early on I'll bet you Frank Gore had 150 yards of runs called back in the first few games of the year every time they take off and get a 10 yard or 15 yard line the change with the offensive line now it gets really tough tonight against the third and twentytwo my queen out of bounds at the 14 and now they're forced to punt down by 13 points and punting from deep in their own territory and same at Patricia's defense has done an excellent job this second half after a bit of a struggle in the first half they have come out here in the second half and delivered on every single series and then of course the big game changer yeah when you do the old fake punt whatever that thing was and this game now is starting to look a little like what some of those experts were saying about it the first part brings it back to the 44 yard line 55 yard booth living yard run back and the callup coming during the return of the kick illegal block in the back the CVT number 36 10yard penalty first down 1124 left in regulation Patriots trying to go to five and as if Tom Brady needed something else in his repertoire tonight it has been the movement skills of Tom Brady that has made the difference good initial pocket step up and throw touchdown here's the one touchdown pass why not this for a gain of eight yards now you get the ball to the closer here right and that play is something that the New England Patriots just love they love being able to get these guards out in front of the play and you don't know defensively is he going to cut up inside of Shaq Mason the most athletic guard that Josh McDaniel says he's ever coached are they gonna pop it to the outside I've seen him play big plays with both for that particular what is the closer normally but he's been the opener and closed her tonight in the past and the four games Dion Lewis has done the heavy lifting until Midway maybe through the third quarter then blunt comes in to put down the hammer but tonight and again it's what the Patriots do go against the grain so much once carry 12 times in the illness only for the two playoff games under 166 yards and seven touchdowns by Ladera that's about all you need check Mason in the backyard as a there Devane sneaking not where they're marking it it's to be just a little short and they're gonna call for the change to come in with our naked eye we think they are three linked short well that time the Colts had somebody on either side of the center so they were able to be a little bit stouter on that quarterback sneak I thought held it short so here comes the measurement and there you see a couple of inches shy fourth down and they're not going to do any favors for the Colts and give them a potential short field boot it away not very often do you see Tom Brady after a quarterback sneak on third and short walking off the field he's converted on the third and fourth and one sneaks about 85 and 90% of the time Whalen left in the fourth five and Oh taking on the Philadelphia Eagles Eagles play the Giants tomorrow night football night gets it started at seven o'clock two weeks Green Bay and invert two undefeated teams on Sunday the Cordia law scheme that with it incomplete second down and ten Harmon coming right out of the middle of the field here and then just reading the quarterback sighs he has really helped this defense a lot this year a couple interceptions already but he is that centerfielder that can go sideline the sidelines make plays like that and really has allowed Devin McCourty to become much more of a role player in the defense and take on a lot of different responsibilities fires that is Coby Fleener making the catch fish every third down now becomes very important third and three since he unbeaten wanted Buffalo today Denver pulls that an overtime win Green Bay knocks off San Diego despite 500 passing yards from Phillip Rivers Carolina won and New England trying to go to five another night and the Lions won today so there are no more winless teams as they knock off the Bears in OT great Johnson to keep the drive alive had to be right there from Andrew Luck pretty good coverage on the outside coming right at you here just enough to where Logan Ryan couldn't reach out and make that play where they needed a drive starter didn't they mmhmm just need something to get them going here big play in a while at a point when if Greenland gets the ball back they can really start to look the clock his receiver fell down on his team wide open dropped to the ground as a flag you know Joe writes who has been playing very well now the deeper into this game we go the more holy number 76 10yard penalty so Rights is right out here now I think a bitch got inside of them and got his back turned sort of pulled him towards him a little bit they started off so well with those quick releases they were hitting the head like six or seven different receivers involved both of whom and they've kind of gotten away from that a little bit here those tight ends could be really valuable to you here and a perfect now it's gone up at the 30yard line so they get a good chunk of the first and 20 back is filled up through set their number one pick out of the University of Miami as fast as they come makes the catch and we second in seven four three three guy and at the combine I think third fastest at that combine and so I'm out there with the lead people are going to give them a little extra room and some of those opportunities will be available block him by himself to the left they go three by one to the right side that's incomplete I intended for Andre Johnson third down and seven one of the reasons some of those quick passes haven't been there is number 91 Jamie Collins right here watch what happens as these crosses come across the field he's going to give Coby Fleener a shot and so that means that basically Andrew Luck has to try and find number two he has missed a few high in this game don't know if that is shoulder related or not third and seven the pressure that he goes Samuel Jones the 20yard line Chandler Jones gets the sack it's a 10yard sack he is twoandahalf tonight is fourth and 17 there's the pressure right at the line of scrimmage and once that happens basically the quarterback just has to get off of you there is no time and so that you get pressure jamming guys at the line of scrimmage and it holds up those guys just know the pressure to get there the 42 balances into the Colts bench in about the 39 yard line Patriots offense 183 in their first five games breaking the record set by the most seven Patriots a record that since been broken 182 which vo 17 as the team that went 16 at all and went into the Super Bowl with a chance for a perfect Asian hello David Tyree the Darracq what we're gain of couple up to the 44 yard line you know but for that sort of accidental pick six that Tom Brady threw that went off the hands of Julian Edelman this has been a little onesided that that play sort of kept the Colts in it in the first half and now we're back to that methodical here comes LeGarrette Blount game as they mock the clock they Trish was fired with 14 total yards Tandy's to 68 make the pick but its third down at seven Henry Anderson jumping up and knocking another he has been a tremendous asset on this football team excellent big plays against the run occasional plays against the past white a find for a third round draft pick 37 in the corner unimpeded all the way around as Al Michaels described it and then there's going to be a little Jam kasky right over the ball to make Tom Brady pull it down long enough for Lowry to get there so once again the Colts defense makes a play and gives the offense one more chance for these holding there's a flag here on a fourth and 14 flag before the snap well start offense number 36 fiveyard penalty we'll make it fourth in 19 you know there aren't many coaches really that make better adjustments and Belichick always plays them down but think of last week the Cowboys come out they have five sacks in the first half it looks like oh my gosh they can't protect Tom Brady about the second half no problem whatsoever struggling a bit defensively tonight the first half a couple of adjustments at halftime there you go taken to the turf at the 15yard line by brandon t by 13 this is Sunday night well bill belichick as usual making the right adjustments the two quarterbacks each to number 12 and Grady that has had the Colts number through the years made by Andre Johnson first down up at the 30yard line well you go back to all those great Manning Brady duels remember Payton lost his first six matchups with Tom Andrew Luck has lost his first four trying to get off that snide tonight you're set for a first down we have seen this offense explode before and it would not surprise me at all now at the bit of a hurry up here remember they went into Tennessee in the fourth quarter they were down 27 14 I think scored three touchdowns and that was when Andrew Locke hurt his shoulder during that fourth quarter so they are certainly capable of mounting a comeback here they were on the verge you going on three that's too high store said right in front of the bench no flag second intent it's just had a couple sail on him today you know it's it's not typical to see him miss hi the way that he's missing was some of these balls tonight that was an opportunity to keep that string a nice plays rolling she has some back there you see the numbers for the Colts excellent the first half and nary a point here in the secondary is incomplete Moncrief was out of bounds butler covering on the play it'll be third down that was a little much to ask that was pure double coverage with their best corner and Malcolm Butler with highlow coverage underneath them I'll tell you third and ten we almost have to consider this for down territory don't you I would the first down ten for a 25 yard game anytime you have what's called this to man coverage where you have those receivers and they're running with their back to the quarterback you see it almost every veteran quarterback knows to pull that one down and take off again this time the pass is low and incomplete intended for Coby Fleener let's say it is not easy to get off the ball if you're a tight end playing against the Patriots they sacrifice rushing the passer to make sure those tight ends take shots every time they're taking off down the field of course the tight in such a big part of this offense Dwayne Allen both had eight touchdowns for this team it's easy to go second incomplete Malcolm Butler seems to be everywhere intended for Weiland to be third down and ten can't play it a whole lot better than that much right here you'll see Butler basically run this route for Grif Whalen almost came down with course we all remember the Super Bowl the unbelievable play but I'll tell you how much respect Bill Belichick has for this guy he put him on Antonio Brown by himself and the opener you ordinarily we think right Belichick always doubleteams the best player on the other team that gaming said go get him out do it for Dorset fourth out of 10 and obviously they'll go for over three and a half to play had a easy first down and just did not see it going to do their old crossing round here he comes across the field there is that half the field he would have walked for the first down at least really is reciever stock for Ventura and the woman's going to take a telling one first hey 30second timeout it was a sixpoint game when the Colts tried this inexplicable unexplainable Kristen Pagano as I said would you snap it for I told you about all you needed to know today was interesting talking with Bill Belichick about his dad and all the college coaches that he used to hang around with and there's an offshoot of that Phil got to hang around with those guys that in the NFL basically you played a 43 defense everybody lined up and here was and all these college guys all had different plans to speak up so he got used to seeing all that crazy stuff fourth and ten the bass intended 14 windows incomplete so New England will get the ball Colts will be compelled to use their timeouts on defense and just hope to get the ball back as quickly as they can yeah just too many throws tonight just hi and that's certainly one that maybe t:y Hill had a chance to catch as well as he jumps well no he won't tell you you'll never know he's one of those warrior kind of guys but just wonder if that shoulder bothered him just enough tonight for him to miss I can think of four or five during the course of this evening that dismissed I started out sharp but then gradually the accuracy diminished patrons can use to fly what take the ball up to the 34 yard line and Indy will take a timeout so then we're gonna Patriots right now you know it's too early to start talking about an undefeated season but let's start talking about it they're gonna go to five and OH they've got their next three games and four out of five at home I mean how would you match this team up right now with the O 7 unit well I don't think they're quite as explosive as that team that had Randy Moss and of course the ability to hit all those big plays I'm not mistaken I think that was the 50 touchdown passes or whatever that year for Tom Brady and they just had the ability to scare you in so many different directions I even brought it up to Tom a little bit last night he said yeah you know not yeah that's not the same sort of he really thinks that Oh 17 was the best team in the history of football not just the history of the Patriots and he had a pretty strong argument until that final game against the Giants Giants Ernest knock them off in the last regular season took place in Arizona the lay of the game here so Bill Belichick who's been the coach of this team since 2000 talked him last night to him but about life after football him made an interesting be saying you know I've got a I got a life away from this he does he loves music please guys good golfer got a few other things going on Bob Kraft with Jonathan off his left shoulder as the era parents are running this team now we have New England taking a timeout second and nine now you've got Lombardi who won five titles two of those were Super Bowls when the Super Bowl began 66 Chuck Noll one four with Pittsburgh all in the 70s Belichick has now been to six as a head coach in one four also been to a couple as an assistant coach remember he was with the Giants back in 90 when they beat the Buffalo Bills in Tampa in the game that Scott Norwood had a chance to win at the end but was wide right that one up again LeGarrette Blount another time out here so we mentioned deflategate like four times in the road just to get that out of the way earlier got the over get me over alright so by the way the thing is not totally over because now it's gonna go to the Court of Appeals in February one of any impact on the season League of course wants to contend that they have the ability to suspend people and have it stick Brady of course not to play because judge Berman overturned the ruling before the season that guy I think mirrors America in terms of hearing about deflategate and up to the 36 yard line here what it'll be fourth down so it ain't over over but it might as well be I mean the whole league versus the Union and all that other stuff it's about power and control you know who has it the players the commissioner who gets final say on punishment all that stuff that football fans just love hearing oh yeah I just love that stuff boy we I think every time you bring up money or courts or fines or whatever you lose another football band so stay on this stay away a bit well what's good enough of it on what's better than offseason hearing Collective Bargaining 17 fighting his way back to you or goes Whalen we got another flag down we've already had 18 accepted penalties in this game and a few unaccepted Slater who's down there special teams maven son of a home Famer Jackie Slater the great gram tackled Massie good shaken up before now he's gonna need some assistance getting over the bench four straight years of the Pro Bowl as a special teamer and four straight years captain holding receiving team number 35 10yard penalty first down Matthew was hobbling over to sidelines would be a significant loss because he is the Pro Bowl guy no special teams great gunner he figures to for the Colts who need two touchdowns pass up combined three for the 32 yard line tackle about 26 of 44 now for 247 yards have to play 39 yard line that is a mod Bradshaw but Brasher cannot get out of bounds so the clock keeps on rolling remark folded Bradshaw is even playing in this game wouldn't get here Monday something like that secondly to throw that one away 2:05 and it will be third down and two this is when things get a little bit tough as a receiver trying to work downfield against eight sometimes nine guys in coverage just not a lot of gaps and say these guys remember the whole thing at the end of the year and I gotta admit I fell into this a little bit too rebus is gone Vince Wilfork and now why did rebus get out of here because he was able to cover up the field and all that sort of stuff Brown was gonna write this guy for guys who started it was Super Bowl pick up the first down and that takes us to the twominute warning with 158 officially so that much time remaining Patriots trying to stay undefeated on Sunday night and Tom Brady when he talks to Michelle after the game say now to play game that mean anything no big deal night this is the only blemish and just need he was able to work it to all his typical targets as he always does in a very workmanlike fashion tonight before it gets out of Basti why Hilton as it steps out first on the 30yard line with 152 left well we certainly have seen stranger things happen so who knows take a couple shots at the end zone here and go back to that onside kick at the the first half that appeared to be recovered by a clone that put C and replay so the Patriots got right down sport too far by Malcolm Butler second down Moncrief about a 4/4 guy and tried this double move and hey there aren't many human beings on earth that can really and stay with guys that are that fast on those double moves but Butler gave up the very early touchdown a whole lot since then second e10 Waveland was able to hold on so he makes a juggling catch that will be a first down at the 18yard line look quickly to the line snap it with 125 left Greg Weiland trying to go from go after that crazy played a hero with a touchdown here 18 yards to make it a onepossession game this is a route that takes some time to do offensive line just against threeman pass rush provides plenty of time and perfectly thrown ball there by luck so here we the National Football League is never over was all going to come down to recovering an onside kick Venna Terry to make it a sixpoint game sleeping over that push the ball of Dean Regina banj so it's plot Collins is a phenomenal athlete he was a triple jumper high jumper and he set the record at the combine right is he the one that went like 11 7 and you saw it finally pay off you say why do they do the long jump at the combine look at this we first saw this with kam chancellor I believe it was with Seattle in the playoffs maybe a year ago if he makes contact with any of those offensive linemen then I think it's a foul but since he cleared everything which of course he can do he's a quiet kid from rural Mississippi we said to him last night you ever meet Brett Farve he said yeah he said bees Plus cook his agent put him in touch with farfar says why don't you come on over and fish in my pond he said I went over any fish that they cleaned them out laying about boy so now it comes down to simply recovering an onside kick piece of New England recovers Indy can't stop the clock and the Patriots can run it out so that puts the good hands guys up front wall has to travel 10 yards or be touched by a patriot before the Colts can recover it kangaroo hawk but that'll be taken Gronkowski is out of bounds at a point 35 yard line and that's gonna that'll do it only needed it was recovery and they can run the clock out now he's so mad at himself he thought he had a touchdown on this play those up makes the play and you anticipate getting hit here he doesn't get hit and he takes off and there's nobody down there he's got a chance good there was fun talking to Tom Brady about Gronkowski and you know we were talking about the chip on the shoulder and all the deflategate and all that kind of stuff he says that Crocs not like that he just got his one of those guys he's never had a bad day in his whole life I don't think comes in never moved a couple of kneel down for landing you saw this fist pump from Belichick yep it isn't on the game for these guys but there is no love lost from the Pats and the coach we go to Michelle yeah but there have been some players lost and now it's Matthew Slater out for the game with a leg injury getting consoled by a number of his teammates on the bench medical staff looking at his right knee he appeared to be in great pain a couple of times as they looked at it so a tough game Marcus cannon also was out in this game the left tackle out yeah they paid a price they'll go home with a victory they take on the Jets next Sunday and then they have a Thursday night game in Foxborough against Miami you might like to don't mind pass along our condolences to Stephanie Infante Lindy and Fontes wife passed away former cult coach Packer coach my coach and Cincinnati great great man so much made about in a Brady and how angry he would come into the game a lot of it is just stuff because what we've known time a long time we watched him play a ton of games long has he not been ready to play and dying to win he has and he's been in the middle of these controversies and he seems to come out of the other end of them in this way by winning football games so back he goes to the locker room and then onto the plane and next week it's the Jets Volkswagen postgame report coming your way next seven the Patriot standing after Charlie by a point at the half doing live wins at 34 27 at Indianapolis the Pats are 5 and OH and the Colts are three and three here are your players of the game LeGarrette Blount carried 16 times for 93 yards including a touchdown a 38 yard he had his first touchdown catch of his career Chandler Jones also had two and a half sacks so he's one of our stars of the game and Tom Brady 23 of 37 better than 300 yards three touchdowns Brady as has been his approach this year has declined to be interviewed which means that one and Jones are the two people that Michele speaks with now down on the field look Garrett your third multi touchdown game against the Colts including your first career receiving touchdown how do you explain the success you have against Indianapolis you know great game planning by the coaches you know you know I stick to the game plan I'll do whatever they need me to do you know I succeed at it you know I just try to be the best at what I can do you know for what they need me to do your offensive line came in a little thin and then Marcus can and got injured how did they piece it together to help you guys out we got it we got a great group you know I'm office line those guys are tough you know their gritty their grimy you know and they do whatever it takes to get the job done you know who's gonna be in there you know we've been rotating guys all season so you know I know whoever's in they're gonna do a great job all right you guys have been downplaying the revenge factor all week long but how much more gratifying was this win I mean it's just like any other win you know we're playing you know we're on the right track you know but on top of that you know we got a lot of things to work on we got a lot of things to get better at so I mean we're just gonna enjoy this way right here tonight congratulations thank you let's turn to Chandler Jones who had two and a half sacks but two very different halves of football what adjustments did you guys make it halftime to keep them at bay in the second half yeah you know Andrew Luck did a tremendous job of moving the ball with his arm in with his feet and there's a few times where a guy out of the pocket and you know we just had to get to him and that was our goal late in the game you know this was a sixpoint game until on fourth down the Colts tried a trick play on special teams as you saw that going on from the sidelines what were you thinking you know I saw the formation that came out in and I wasn't sure what was going on but I thought it was a fake and there was great awareness by special teams and a hats off to our special chamber our special team coach great job in that play well now I'm gonna try it with you as well the revenge factor the plan for tom factor downplayed all week but how satisfying was this one it was a win there's another win in our win column and we run to the Jets thank you Bob all right Michelle their gritty their grimy but they stay on script that's for sure they have now beaten their once arch rivals the Indianapolis Colts seven straight times and Andrew Luck is Owen five for his young career against the Patriots since the Pats were two and two and the sky was falling last season they are 18 and two including the playoffs and their run to the Super Bowl last

  "transcript": "the time Indianapolis is a warm and welcoming city but not tonight because one mr. Tom Brady miss phaedra September running into town to take on the Gulf's on Sunday night the roof is closed at Lucas Oil Stadium on the edge of downtown since 2008 a much anticipated matchup tonight Tom Brady was playing in some other solar system thus far this season and his Patriots come in to face Andrew Luck in the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday Night Football now my close Cris Collinsworth Michele if the boy it's a game that both teams had circled on their calendar when the schedule came out last spring and the Patriots come in smoking hot for know looking every bit like the Super Bowl champions they are playing very well on both sides of the ball and tonight they were taking on the Indianapolis Colts with the hottest quarterback right now in the NFL and Tom Brady the cult started the season coming out of the gate stumbling with two losses but now they have won three in a row a record with three and two on top and the AFC South but the big question all week has been with Andrew Luck battling a shoulder issue throwing shoulder be ready tonight he is he and Chris we've watched him in practice on Friday you watched him throw tonight what you think he's throwing up pretty well you know maybe not quite the same zip that we've seen out of him in the past but it doesn't matter tonight's more about leadership for Andrew Luck this is a Patriots team that has embarrassed him and all four tries that he's had against them so he had no choice he had to plan he has to lead it's just one of those kinds of moments tonight let's talk about the Patriots we all know the Colts blew the whistle which led to what we know is deflate gate they can say only wants another game and we have seen it since opening night this Patriots team has played with an intensity a borderline anger that maybe we haven't seen since 2007 and you can only imagine the emotion of Tom Brady and his teammates tonight as they take the field and somehow someway the Colts know they have to try and match the intensity of Tom Brady it's the marquee matchup of week six it's the NFL's virgin for Sunday night well as you know if you follow the NFL quite the buildup to this one especially in New England for more on that down of the field and Michele Tafoya Michele well al the DNA of this rivalry was altered completely during the AFC Championship game when the Colts maids a claim that the Patriots were playing with underinflated footballs will this week the media tried and tried to get the Patriots to talk about the revenge factor and the results were predictable I'm always pretty motivated is anyone pulling the side in the grocery store well as long as Bill Belichick has been the head coach the Patriots have made it a policy to let their actions do the talking so tonight with the Patriots have their own Michelle to that point what's happened the last few times they've met the last two regularseason games the Patriots have outscored them 101 to 44 you're throwing the two playoff games both blowouts 88 29 so in the last four meetings combined 189 to 73 you go back before luck got here and the Patriots have won overall six straight counting postseason Stephen foul ski will kick off for the New England Patriots they won the toss and as they always do they defer Bill Belichick loves to have the ball at the end of the first half and then start the second half with it you're so wailing back there Gronkowski will await his turn we're gonna see luck right away as Indianapolis will get go from the Indiana State Capitol Waymon about six yards here Patriots Dharana Farman their free safety and special team star makes the stop here's the cold starters Andrew Luck Stamper crane boy do you Tiwa Hilton FIU Andre Johnson for you Dwayne Allen Clemson Coby Fleener Stanford Anthony Costanzo Boston College Jack Newhart the Ohio State University call it Holmes USC q Thornton Illinois Joe Wright's Western Michigan Goran Andre Johnson two longtime stars in their first years here were first played in San Francisco Andre in Houston and off we go the Johnson along the sideline covered there by Logan Ryan so Andre Johnson who scored two touchdowns in their win a week and a half ago on a Thursday night at Houston starts by making a catch on the first play from scrimmage one thing you know if you're gonna play the Patriots is your other receivers are going to have to make plays somebody other than T Y Hilton that's a good start prints up to the 27 yard line the former 49er bore chugging his way at the age of 32 for a gain of four Jamie Collins makes the tackle on so Andrew Luck in his first three games one win two losses five touchdowns he had 40 last year to leave the league and seven interceptions in those three games he said he hurt himself at the end of the third game against Tennessee but did lead them to a victory by second down and six now from the 31 yard line making the catch just off the turf is Dwayne Allen just above the surface for a game out to the 35 yard line setting up a third down and two let's take a look at Andrew Luck see how that motion is right now that clearly he's had a lot of work done on that shoulder he hasn't really put any zip on a throw yet but he's trying to control it it'd be perfectly honest when we watched him in practice I thought Matt Hasselbeck threw it a little bit harder the luck is going to try and make do out here tonight do the best again Hasselbeck led them to two wins against Jacksonville and then despite being sick all week against makes the catch so Andrew Luck begins with a couple of passes to the left side and backtoback first downs then I'll bring Jamie Collins on the Blitz right here jack new hoard who moved over to left guard from right tackle earlier picks him up but that it's a good sign an Andrew Luck I think learned a little something from Matt Hasselbeck in his starts it's OK to get the ball out quickly and it's one of the things that pep Hamilton wants to do to help him tonight they don't want him holding the football they just signed the Bradshaw he was here last year broke his leg he was out of football until the play fake to him it's wide open for a gain of six let's take a look at the New England starter Rob Nick of its Purdue Alan branch university of michigan silver Salina Utah challenge owns Syracuse University dammit Colin 7 me Giraud Mayo Tennessee Jonathan Frannie broker now from Bob West Alabama universe Patrick Chung the Ducks Devin McCourty Rucker Logan Ryan Rutgers one key guy not here is the great linebacker Dante Hightower who was injured in the game at Houston inactive tonight not even on the trip hassle back on the sideline at the age of 40 leading them to those two wins taken down by McCourty gain of 23 Wayne Allen's going to come down on a strap right there and spring this out nice block down the field by Khalid Homs and could not have had a better start to this game a couple of completions and now you get Frank Gore going this is a good start for the Colts at the 25yard line Bradshaw flanking luck in the backfield it's Phillip Dorsett their number one great choice she went in motion for the slot on the right side Tony quarantine five yard penalty Anthony Costanza Chris you know we talked about I described it as a shoulder issue because the Colts have been very circumspect and Lux been very circumspect as to exactly what it is what do you think well whatever it is he said he's gotten a lot of massage a lot of treatment he doesn't think it's anything serious it's just the soreness and we sort of hinted around about you know with Drew Brees we were saying he can only throw it 25 yards and he kind of smiled and knocked it a little bit so we'll find out how far you can throw one once we get into the game first and 15 former giant and the cult who goes to the 26 yard line so they made the trade for Trent Richardson that didn't work out and then they picked up Frank Gore and Bradshaw gets a hand a popular player here we saw him break his leg in the New England game last year he was out of football until last week they brought him in and right now he's in there to back up Frank Gore and if you want to talk about intensity playing running back you can't do a whole lot better than a mod Bradshaw and Frank Gore they are going to match any intensity anybody can break so a pepper Hamilton the offensive coordinator calling in the plays this is what he's dialed up on second and 11 to the left side talk to the 16 goes the tight end and that'll make it third down and a yard yard to have just the fourman rush but watch the protection here for Andrew Luck earlier this year that was a major factor they reshuffled this offensive line and from that moment on they seem to be much better that and the fact that clearly tonight we're seeing a little different Andrew Luck a much quicker release third down and one now go with two tight ends luck empties the backfield we'll be a first down Malcolm Butler makes the stop but Indy keeps moving first down just enough here on the tail end of this thing by Donte Moncrief just give a little bit of an edge getting out there for Jack Doyle to catch that thing and die for the first down little taste of their own medicine who's Donte Moncrief lays a little pick on the Patriots the strive began at the 11yard line they picked up four first downs along the way at the 13 yard line it'll be second down and nine the Patriots on early downs trying to keep those two deep safeties back there Matt Patricia feeling this way here so he's hoping that with his front seven they can handle the running game inside big night tonight to try and get some pressure from these defensive ends they have good pass rushers they're going to have to try an impact Andrew Luck as you can see no TDS on the opening drive and the equivalent of a season plus five games 21 games since the Colts have scored a touchdown on their opening drive second and nine at the six and trying to get the first dynasty wide open as they come into spot it appears to be a little bit short of the first it's going to be third down and inches the strait zone defense a little unusual just going to circle back inside here Tampa to defense where the soft spot was so let's say it's Andrew Luck is seeing the field he is not anxious he's not nervous sometimes you hit him with a little different defense out there then maybe what they typically play he read it perfectly well he's only seven for seven lucky fill in 57 yards are a lot Tipton is the running back they fake it to him just throw that away so good coverage chase that by Rob mint kovitch and now it's fourth down and one so it appears they're going to leave the offense in Ning kovitch managed to get outside just enough to keep the pressure on lock their butt here we go well I can you know you think of the fact that New England's going to score Bellatrix going to run down there to get a closer look at the alignment he wants to see how the coast line up does he want to take a timeout he's only down at the 16 yard line Tipton is the running back bill does not call a timeout and look Rosie three for the touchdown they enforce me a check a lot of people thought this would be a blowout from the start the Colts have other ideas did montcrief controlled it and stay in bounds before he went onto the chalk remember it's a fourth that way and remember Annie is the same as two feet I think the knee is going to be down very close to but when the elbow was well boy almost simultaneously they're looking at New York what hits first I think it was the knee if I had to put a stake in the ground Tony Curran T we'll take a look and he has the leader not after reviewing the play the ruling on the field is confirmed touchdown any karate seeing what you're going to see in a moment we have the definitive angle right there does the knee hit first or the elbow very clear need down have control controls it all the way to the ground Butler with the coverage 13 plays 89 yards and another Angeles one der Adam Vinatieri 20th year in the league first part of his career of course with the Patriots ending in the middle of the last decade and the extra point he's going to be in a shootout ghost word 1/4 of wanted face offensive music deserves headline this fabulous rivalry the years hovercraft stifling a yawn watching his team pushy his own since the mid90s his team fall behind against Buffalo 7nothing and it wasn't Yahner from there they haven't trailed very often this year less than six minutes out of 240 minutes coming into the game tonight touch back let's take a look at the Patriots starters Tom Brady Michigan Dion Lewis Pitt Julian Edelman Penn State Danny Amendola Texas Tech Rob Gronkowski Arizona Michael Williams Marcus cannon Texas Christian University a sin Georgia to David Andrews Georgia Josh Sean Penn State Sebastian Ballmer as you were watching those intros at the jet planes coming through the building here because everybody is standing and drinking and going oh they love the Patriots here from the 20 the crowd already in full faith in you indeed that he gets it away there's a flag on the other side of the fields a threeyard pickup for Julian Edelman and Tony Clemente will tell us all about it it looked like Trent Cole may have jumped a little early on that one outside defense number 58 longtime Philadelphia Eagle Brian Grigson their general manager went out he got a lot of older players it's almost as if they brought in the Pro Bowl alumni group Johnson and Cole we also brought in some pretty talented young defensive linemen and that's where they had been beaten in the past two rookie defensive tackles each played at Stanford Anderson intended for Gronkowski covered by Jackson so Tom Brady tie in a team record tonight 212th start with the Patriots we asked him if he knew about that last night I said no he said he said hoot hoot hoot whose record on my time Bruce Armstrong he said is a great guy Armstrong was playing his last year when gratings in his first Gareth one that comes into the game he's the back after Lewis had started it second down his guard and what bulldozes his way out to the 29 yard line a yard short of the first down for LeGarrette Blount he has been a bit of a nightmare for sports defense but you typically don't see a lot of him in the first half just six first half carries compared with 27 in the second but after the success he's had against this team I think Bill Belichick said let's get him out there Louis on the sidelines on third down and a half er off times Brady goes right to the line for a sneak not this not this time folks are able to make some changes lunch stays in the backfield he sneaks it anyway as he has done so proficiently for so many years and the first down at the 31 yard line it was right in behind the rookie Center david andrews who has not missed the snap this season i think as long as you leave a gap open as they did here between the guard and the center i almost think it's automatic that tom is just going to take it that a lot of teams now we'll stack somebody on either side of the center trying to take that away but as long as you don't defensively you can almost count on I'm gonna have finished in the opening quarter remain those are on top seven nothing and green by Hammond or Danny Amendola up to the 38 yard line gain of seven Erik Walden the linebacker makes the stop second down and three the one change up front now for the New England Patriots Marcus cannon takes over for one of their best players Nate's older at the left tackle position he is there all season long but Nate's older a very good player and the only firstround draft pick on this entire office why that's Lewis the running back at the bottom of the screen Brady receiver to the 43 let's take a look at the Colts defense come to Langford and David Perry Stanford Henry Anderson Stanford Erik Walden don't know how to coil Jackson Marilyn Jarell Freeman Mary harden Bailey Trent Cole Cincinnati correct old st. Paul's polish Mike Adams Delaware Blue Hens white Lowry from San Jose State Vontae Davis double senior high school DC last week in Houston a couple of interceptions made by Mike Adams Bregman husky is the defensive coordinator sort of a revamp defense was silly old is starting defense in the league even with the two rookies in there and wing has been able to just in the last several meters second down and seven he swings it over the middle and that's caught by Scott Chandler in his first year as a patriot after several seasons in Buffalo first down at the 36 yard line couple of plays ago we saw Marcus Cannon who remember is the backup left tackle and he looks like he's limping around maybe something on that right foot area and that would be major news stays in there for the moment and overtakes it all the way down the middle to the 11 yard line tackled by dwight lowry brady going hurry up no huddle well the one thing the Colts did not want to see in this game the catch and run the yards after the catch and that one couldn't have been any easier three minutes to go Oh Lois it'll be second down in ten Diablos what a story he is came up with Philadelphia a couple of years then went to Cleveland broke his leg didn't play football for two years even though he was in the Indianapolis camp last year for one week they brought him in week two he was inactive then they let him go and Bill Belichick to the Patriots had their eye on him and signed him to a futures contract on New Year's Eve last year and set a pretty good future this year when the Colts let him walk out of here I think that qualifies as a oops has been sensational the most elusive running backs in the game second to 10 and the Patriots take a China in the south is a weak division so India's on top he's the one today they beat Jacksonville on Tennessean the Jaguars are just one win apiece after the timeout second down and 10 down from the one caste split wide to the left Grady that's pointed into the endzone for the touchdown goes Julian Edelman Rhaenys favorite target this season what a year he's having Edelman for the touchdown well the Colts are just rushing three and watch Tom Brady step up on the move make a very accurate throw they're taking some of their best pass rushers on the outside you see Robert Mathis out there and instead of rushing him off the edge they're trying to get a hit on those slot receivers that time it simply did not work Edelman made a mess Edelman already now with 36 catches in four games plus a quarter that's his fourth touchdown catch Stephen gustas B for the extra point and each team drives the length of the field on its first possession Indiana State Capitol on a Sunday night Julian Edelman scoring the touchdown but may have paid a price here look at Frank Gore we're gonna show you heaven in a second as we start with the touchback here and here what settlements what we were talking about Chris Sanford the cash there we go and I hate to put it in these terms but if you're going to hurt a finger that's the one you hope for is a receiver because you can tape it to the finger next to it and most of the catching ability with your hands comes with the inside fingers and your thumb so you'll see yeah maybe you won't he's just gonna take that thing right up and see what happens I'd rather have a root canal Frank Gore is the running back from the 20 yard line on first down three all right let's take a look back here's 2014 and what that motion looks like really driving through it so far tonight we've seen a little less of that a little bit more of load on the fall and that's sort of what we saw in practice now it doesn't mean he can't do it but the pass is so far he hasn't had to really step in and drive for the 26 yard line in and out of the hands of Frank Gore and it's Jonathan free me right there who nearly had the interception kind of dropped the elbow on that one and it got away from him as he stepped up and turned to throw it really fortunate that that thing did not get away watch his right elbow sort of dip under and when you do that the ball is going to sail whether you're a pitcher or otherwise so third down and seven now at the 23 yard line pointing at everybody else false start offense number 31 fiveyard penalty remains there down he met 81 he met Andre Johnson Andre Johnson a little history with that man Chuck Pagano actually recruited him at the University of Miami Johnson played their Frank Gore played there as well 12 get to the first down Walker he shoved back just a little shy of it and that'll make it fourth down and to quite a bit of zone defenses out of both of these teams you just get the feeling that they're really not wanting to do this whole matchup on the outside and here you go championship game he was being followed by everybody including Devin McCourty over the top of him almost on every snap so far haven't really seen that but still that too deep safety to be having just a spin who's this one to the 16 yard line a flag is thrown down the sideline he's going to come back he's going to get tackled at the 46 yard line but the flag came out right away as he began the run back in the coast defense only they're going all the way down to about the 20 yard line figuring this one is going to come back as it normally does on a return of that nature it looked like Devin McCourty right at the point of the catch gave a little shove we'll start Deepa that our own territory 77 in Indianapolis there's their left tackle Marcus cannon taking the place of the injured Nate soldier to begin with he's back in the locker room thus Sebastian glommer goes to left back on Cameron Fleming who is just activated this week is the new right tackle with his juggling and shuffling along that Patriot offensive front continues meanwhile he got jumping the defense the past Edelman lament a first down should be a free play that might be coal again has already been flagged once but this time they will take the play because the gain of 13 outside defense number 58 in the neutral zone the time results of the play is a first down let's go to Michelle LaMarcus cannon went to the locker room al he had his right big toe examined by team doctors along the sideline he is questionable with that toe injury all right Thank You Michelle we saw him going back to the locker room the shuffling up front you got a rookie Center the left side swimming just activated and dropping it right over the middle will be second down and ten I won't see that one very often of course whenever Julian Edelman drops the ball you wonder whether or not the he's thinking a little bit about that hand perfectly thrown here hit him right in the face mask let's say the one thing you do not want as a football team is to get hit hard with injuries at the same position and right now the tackle position is that position for the Patriots couple of seasons it's not up to the 24yard line short game really wind makes the tack that will be third down and seven as we took down to the final minute of the opening quarter right here is going to play off of this doubleteam get himself back into that play anytime the Garrett one goes on the ground this crowd goes crazy because they haven't seen it very often in Indy with those two defensive tackles both played at Stanford 3rd down and 7 up in the 24 and a whistle before the snap timeout had been taken so Tom Brady of course every quarterback loves a clean pocket with no contact and all the rest so his numbers right there very very good when he gets contact there he's outside the pocket even better in terms of the pass reading quite in contrast to last year those are his numbers for the whole season for TDs and six interceptions when he was either contacted around side of the fire so that's a significant difference from last season for him yeah and you see he said he has worked very hard this offseason he saw those numbers he knew what they were we worked really hard on that part of his game and escaping outside the pocket as well and center rose and that is caught that's Edelman that crossing wrote and that's a first down up to the 33 yard line when adapt Kol Julian's number that's four catches for him in the quarter ever seen a situation where sometimes the little brother gets more upset when the big brother gets attacked the big brother does Julian Edelman has sort of carried that burden that's a twoyard gain by one and that's going to take us to the second quarter so after one it's New England seven something like before zooms at business tonight aerial coverage being brought to you by Geico down Indianapolis Sunday night Al Michaels Cris Collinsworth Michele Tafoya Sunday Night Football second and nine as we begin the second quarter side with Brady shoulder shape go back outside to hold it in and Keshawn Martin for a gain all the way down to the 27 yard no idea I think that was Greg Toller out there look like because Gronkowski was wide open underneath he basically knocked Mike Adams to the ground look like Toller reacted to Gronkowski and just gave up the deeply McMartin up in a trade with the Texans in the 27 again now it's incomplete running away with it was told her but did not very far second down to ten so we all know the rules now I think we all know the rules now it catch two feet down and be able to make some sort of a move related to that catch to escape and not enough time on that catch the key is you think we know there have been a few this year that think anybody knows second I'm in ten minute Louis in the backfield and this time it's Edelman but not very far Toller shadowing him and that will set up a third down and five at the 22 josh mcdaniels calling in the play this Patriots team just so good when they can get third down and six or less but very very average beyond that and it is right on the border here third and five of the 22 this book then tasks you lied to the right send Edelman that way as well again escape straws to incomplete intended for Danny Amendola so Brady got another trouble avoided the sack but now his fourth and five and in comes the field goal unit one of the things they wanted to do was to force Dion Lewis to block Brady had to escape there might have been able to run for that first down they have plenty of attention for Gronkowski coming across the middle as always there was your first down though of Tom Brady had seen about that woman 19 straight longest curves Street off the foot of Gustafsson 40yard attempt down and once again perfection into the second quarter and the Patriots take a threepoint lead the hit drama Chicago Fire is back this Tuesday's episode will push the entire house to the brick and all the Chicago Fire you'll see it after the voice this Tuesday night right here on NBC truck pagano's pedigree is defense that's who he's coaching them along the sidelines Brett muskie is their defensive coordinator it's a 107 ballgame touched back here Andrew Luck in the pocket and when he's out of the pocket were contacted when it's clean pretty good for two DS two interceptions but when he gets contacted or outside the pocket quite a contrast to the way it's been in the past one td5 picks and remember he missed two games so that's over his three games coming into this one tonight and when I think of Andrew Luck I sort of think of Ben Roethlisberger you know how Roethlisberger's is big guy in the pocket and people sort of fall off of him and that's the way luck has played a little bit but tonight he's been much quicker getting the ball out of his hands and I think his offensive lineman critically appraised here Frank Gore getting it too you know so many subplots and side stories to this game you know most of them another one that would be Chuck Pagano is in his fourth year in Annapolis coached it's the last year of his contract he's won 11 regular season games in each of the first three years they offered him a oneyear extension he said no I'm gonna play it out and bet on myself yeah and he said the one thing that cancer definitely has taught me is that I'm going to live for today I'm going to bet on my team and my players and that's exactly what he's doing from the 22 yard line now it's second down and eight a month free to haul it in up at the 40yard line in a nineteen well let's dismiss any concerns about Andrew Luck shoulder he just stepped into this one and drove it hard right down the middle of the field perfectly time but once again hitting that back foot and getting the ball out look at that protection around him Anthony Costanzo terrific that time up at the 42 yard line inside handoff for up to the 46 yard line McCourty makes the tackle it'll be second down and five they just think that Frank Gore has made all the difference in the world for this Colts team this is a team that I think Andrew Luck has had what 1 100 yard rusher and the entire time that he's been here and yet this guy knows how to run the football so many years in San Francisco but watch how low he gets running the back always falling forward for that extra 2 or 3 yards Andre Johnson covered by Ryan third and five well Frank Gore came out of Miami went to San Francisco the first few years were pretty lean then the team got very good very durable sixty six straight starts eleven thousand three hundred ninety rushing yards and ten consecutive seasons steady solid consistent and they say they can't get me to talk about anything but football how's your family that's good but I can't believe I stumbled upon his nature just slings it away that was Dominique Easley who came in and forced the throw it will be fourth down that was pretty much everybody having success here comes easily off the top into this and watch him he sort of set that back and was almost ready to jump to try and knock it down then when Locke pulled it down went after him New England doesn't call that many blitzes but they did there and correct he has to have a little bit of a I think it's whether or not he was in or out of the pocket whether it's intentional grounding or not might be the issue well and the other issue there was that was the first time that we've seen luck have to make a really awkward throw and immediately you think how did his shoulder hold up to that kind of a release and almost well now we're on new standing there one of the officials may need a little time out himself so correct he calls a timeout we'll be back coming to you from Indianapolis at McAfee 2part Danny and 11 yard line and the official wheat we needed a timeout for a moment because the official time it was the line judge and it was yep there was a rare Oh ran into him the barn wants and an extra moment and that's why we had the officials timeout had to go through the protocol over there back in tough wine Joyce baby didn't make him sit out of light now the Patriots from there his deal incomplete than before Danny Amendola again Brady working behind that makeshift offensive line Billy wind came charging through to force at that time second down Billy Wynne is having a night here so far watch the quick move inside and nobody picks him up he just goes straight through and drives Tom Brady into the ground can't get the ball out any quicker than that he still got Brady on a second detail Mike Adams pick Grady off twice last year and now you begin to wonder about Edelman that's three times since that finger was either broken or dislocated that he's been unable to hang on to the football well and we're seeing Julian Edelman almost try and catch the ball more with his body and with an underhand catch then I can remember seeing him maybe he just lost a little confidence or it's hurting him but I have never seen Julian Edelman struggle to catch the football like this that was a perfectly thrown ball amazing in this place is rocking now that gives the cult stoolie so that's three juggle or dropped by Edelman now about Mike Adams yeah last week he was Defensive Player of the Week and comes right back with another one here today 12th year in the league he's been around for different his first Pro Bowl last year the extra point by Venna Terry is good and with 11 and a half to go say well julian edelman caught a touchdown pass for New England's touchdown tonight hurt himself dislocated or fractured the finger on the play there it was and since then three bobbles and or drops including this most recent one now watch his right hand the underneath hand is the one that he hurt does it even touch the football and you don't often see Julian Edelman with those underhanded cradle catches here's another one just like it to juggle loose at the 35yard line and the Patriots didn't have the football McDaniel's taking a look into the scrum as well at least the Patriots think they have it they have one called saying we've got it I love this play because they have so many guys right here on the line of scrimmage there's nobody right behind them tremendous takeoff guy is able to put in the spot where his team can get it Hunter extraordinaire and the officials are gathering after announcing that the Colts have the ball let's underneath the patriot player they're fine I don't think he ever quite had control of it the referee is saying that Moncrief Donte Moncrief who is remembered tanning blue is the man who came out with it well he's got it there I'm not sure the officials realized we see the Bulls the courts here comes the challenge flag Gallants playing now coming from the cult sideline meaning that they announced it as the Colts ball but clearly they meant New England and a had a challenge from Pagano far from that not much going on here Indianapolis is challenging the ruling on the field of recovery alright so announced nd had it that was wrong now they signal in room hazard and Pagano makes the challenge in New York to take a peek so a week Toni Kroos but they're basically saying is that there's not enough visual evidence to overturn it Josh Klein is the guy at the bottom for New England 67 and there's the ball coming up and Moncrief comes up with it comes away from the huddle but when they looked at it they said they didn't have the indisputable visual evidence of clear recovery and thus New England still has the ball at the 35 yard Jonathan Newsome finally got to a secondary did its job and the Newsome is able to come in to collect the sack crossing but it was really Newsom who went out in coverage and then came back in and still got the sack Boyard sacks second down and 14 dr. Lewis and the Haitian gonna take off new yard the first flag comes in Mike Adams made the tackle if at the moment is a game of 11 I think it gonna get a face mask here as the Dallas Cowboys will tell you you just reach for Dion Lewis you're not sure what you're going to get and I think was Mike Adams who quite by accident grabbed that facemask just trying to as so many people we saw Dallas a week ago try and get him down around the goal line and there was about six guys that best like that so it would have been a third down and three becomes the first down at the Colt 43 yard line gentlemen have to go in the half Indianapolis up five back easily Gary Coxe a stoppage for the question was on the enforcement of the penalty the boss has been moved up 1/2 the yard all right no timeout I'm starting with you bill so it moves it to the 42 and 3/16 first down angles over the left side takes the ball to the 38 yard line the Colts have basically remade this defensive line that had been run over in the past by LeGarrette Blount and they have done a better job here tonight really Zack Kerr was the only guy that was on this defensive line a year ago that came back and he's inactive tonight it's the Henry Anderson's and the David Perry's in the King wankers second down and six inside the turn chase down touchdown Patriots so much for that for a guy who has just killed the cults in the last couple of seasons to play they loved bringing Jack Mason around and then watch Klein coming down here and getting this block that time blunt instead of following Jack Mason one of the most athletic guards they've ever had in New England he ducked back inside and it looked like the quell Jackson just over ranted a bit there he goes again though it has been a nightmare for this team trying to tackle the gear the extra point is good one but tents 50 yards TV here back and forth we go in this one 1714 Sunday night football brought to you by Nissan innovation that excites by Bud Light make the right call drink responsibly by FanDuel the leader in fantasy football and by fallout 4 available November the 10 that is what they called deflate cake you know that's an over/under out there but how many times will save deflate gate tonight if I heat the plate cake the plate cake the plate pour you in the over they're sucking footballs around town too by going 65 yards in for plays the cautious killing or the patrons killing the Colts on the ground the last two regular season games 361 on the ground last two postseason games for 11 and 9 touchdowns and a lot of that is Blount the last two postseason games and then there was a guy named Jonas Gray who last year came in here ran for almost 200 yards made the cover of Sports Illustrated was late for a meeting the next week and the next thing you know God well he went to camp this year but he's in Miami right now they brought blood back from Pittsburgh and Belichick just guys go guys come back they just Coby Fleener you know it's interesting Chris is that it's Ben Dion Lewis who's been starting the games like going six innings and then the relief pitcher comes in blunt but tonight leave it to Belichick Lewis hasn't carried the ball once then Blunt has five carries yeah well history has a little something to say about that as well when a team struggles and yeah they're better along that defensive line but there is a confidence with this Patriots offensive line especially now with the injuries that they're going through at the tackle position why not go back to what has worked over the years and certainly that has been LeGarrette Blount second down and eight from the 22 yard line pooja and he's able to slide by Butler picked up the first by the Super Bowl hero for gain of 13 and coverage from extreme off position here just going to shoot across there and for Butler just there was no way for him to catch up and so what you're seeing now is a little bit of what we see the Patriots do so often try and get the ball out of Andrew Luck span and allow his playmakers to make friends after the catch territory the Ron Harmon makes the tackle at the 47 end of 18 both guards very good here Jackie you whored over here on the left side and over here a double block on the part of Hugh Thornton who came in to line up about three weeks ago for the specific purpose of getting this running game going they simply were not running the football but Frank Gore now having an edge with this new offensive line for six carries 55 yards tea wide open incomplete second intent one thing Andrew Luck talked about was our receivers have to be ready for contact at the line of scrimmage watch Malcolm Butler come over and get contact here on T y Hilton and then just scramble to catch up does a nice job getting his head turned around but Bella check to us no question about it Malcolm Butler right now is our best cornerback only head Darrelle Revis he's gone Browner's gone a Turing things gone and Butler of course was the man who lived forever in New England Lawrence the interception to see the Super Bowl victory there's making the tackle at the 35yard line is Logan Ryan third a third and five where did Logan Ryan have a good game a week ago against Dallas couple interceptions Lilly has played a lot of that slot position for New England this year which i think is one of the toughest positions in all of football so he stepped up and done a nice job third and six first down 32 yard line the Colts are going to try and run one of these pick plays across here like that but it ended up being his own defense nice call by Matt Patricia to fool him and so luck really with no choice bad shoulder and all had to take off and that was a good choice there not afraid is it mmhmm is a stout proud guy and he wanted to play in this game check out number one overall pick in 2012 his fourth season three tight ends he takes the ball to the 29 yard line that's a gain of five there's the 40year old Matt Hasselbeck came out of his sickbed to lead them to a Thursday night win we could have to go against Houston he was so impressive it would be hard to describe and you wouldn't want us to describe the week that he had leading up to that let's just say he left the meetings a lot that week second down and five from the 29 late at Stanford with two up it picks up the first down one of the things you love about Frank door is his ability to block watch him pick up the blitzing linebacker here and just stone him not even a step after that No Fee Fleenor who had such a big day this last November when they played against the Patriots here 144 yards in that game on seven catches coming up with the big one there and through the backfield here now door comes back e from the slot to the his blockers will but a flag comes in Dana Hey Tony correctiy with the core holding offense number 62 repeat first down that's the center Holmes balsam innate your game yeah just as an Inca bitch here was trying to go for the play watch the arm hook around the helmet of Ning kovitch and pull them to the ground good call some counted homes with the the penalty for 15 remaining in the half the napkin fourth game first and as a teammate comes in we can have interference here dorset the rookie working with Devin McCourty all that a little bit of a forceout I would think oneonone and McCourty of course a safety who used to be a cornerback past interference well that's the first foul on McCourty this year and last year as well he did not have a single foul but he has one here just set up a first out of the 8 yard line Lord he's gonna try and just get underneath him and work his body to push him out of bounds but the officials watch that closely defensive back in this league and that's Jaime Campos athletic is any defender at any position in the National Football League grew up in Mississippi as a quarterback in high school played every position was a track star as well Jamie Collins and talking to the Colts coaching staff they said other than JJ Watt there is nobody in the NFL that we have to specifically game plan more than Jamie Collins he can do anything he can run over your back he can cover he can blitz he is a fantastic player that came up huge in the game against that second down and goal from the Cordys from the quartic is able to save the touchdown and it will be third down and goal one of the things that the Colts are doing here is what the Patriots do so often with Gronkowski just wait to get that right match up so you bring all those tight ends in split them out wide find out the matchup you like best that time against the safety McCourty and Patricia I would think likes that matchup typically they lost that one though Patricia was able to send in five or six different defenders Jack goodness foots out to the right side and on third down and goal New England is going to take big time a quarterback comparison thus far tonight pretty close to the best you know it's kind of what you would expect out of this thing and it's been well played yeah I know that all this stuff coming in to this game but when it got right down to it it was two terrific football teams of course the Colts have won three in a row after that slowish start Tom Brady we all know about his motivation for this one that was really interesting that that last sequence there bees Patricia since five or six different defenders in and then he sees how the Colts line up and they they take the time if they may have had too many guys on the field to begin with and there's Cheung he's trying to wave another he's trying to wave McCourty off the guys come in guys going and they had to take the time out to avoid the penalty third and goal now ordinarily you don't run but this is kind of one of those games that anything can happen in this one and now they're gonna go spread so his first touchdown of the season was a spy on that play watch him follow luck around as soon as luck broke out of the pocket he had to react and then it opened up the slot right in behind it 40 white Hilda tremendous play tremendous play by Andrew Luck not many quarterbacks can find a receiver after making that move with Jamie Collins coming right down his throat tremendous and he worked that throw around him almost a threequarter sidearm throw great play the end zone for the first time the point is good good game back and forth we go to go so then it fell mobile you can watch local and primetime NFL games live on your smartphone log onto nfl.com slash mobile the Patriots have completely changed their kickoff return team now they're not allowing another opportunity and McAfee stick will bound through the end zone another player and evolved and what's taking place over the past nine months Ryan brixon who was the man who contacted the National Football League office about the possible under inflation of footballs which led to you know what and nine months of stuff remember Tom Brady was initially suspended for the first four games of the season that was overturned had that suspension as you look at the ownership the Kraft family of the Patriots had the suspension not been overturned this would've been Grady's first game back instead he comes in four and oh and a prime MVP candidate from the twenty escape his aim and goal Amendola takes it to the indianapolis 45 yard line break Toller finally lashes a man for a game to 35 Amendola just working inside and then once he comes back out his tom brady sort of buying a little time and as that zone defense got stretched there were gaps that Amendola was able to take advantage of but once again now we hit on it a little bit earlier in the game but the movement of tom brady that are making some big plays now takes us to the twominute warning post by four in on the first half and it's been a really good panther football 21:17 Patriots have it they have one timeout at the disposal of balls at the 45 back here and you will go out of bounds at the 38 crotch house keep it a little lonely out there tonight see a lot of coverage that's the only pass thrown to them in the first half and you can run it over the top of them these pass rushers the Robert Mathis is and the trick poles who are only used to rushing the passer are dropping underneath those quick closed and and it really is cause a bit of a disruption second and two well Marcus cannon who started at left tackles and I've remains questionable with a right toe injury he had gone to the locker room he's back out right we see emmechelle and on the sidelines that's created Balmer going to left tackle its created Cameron Fleming it was activated this week on the white tack the third down and two at the 37 yard line not getting to the line the gain is Dion Lewis Bremen makes the tackle and that's going to set up a fourth and one they had exactly what they wanted they've got the star running back out here on the edge and the ball was thrown slightly behind but Freeman was able to catch up to that one really Dion Lewis has to drive off the ball far enough to make sure he has that first down and so here we go so it's the end of one and now Brady's gonna try one fourth and one at the 36 the big more Squad is in the backfield to pick up the first down Julian what a cop I McDaniels in motion takes it and then a spinorama around Walden to get the first down they did too good a job that time both guys understood exactly what that was Walden had it to quell Jackson did it and Julian Edelman just somehow made that work that was dead to rights for 34 this is exactly what New England tries to do when they win the coin awesome they defer 61 in the last 62 times they defer what Belichick loves to do is have the ball at the end of the first half and then get it again in the second day of in effect it's a double play you're getting backtoback possession so they'll take as much time off the clock as they can Patriots out second down and seven when they still have one time at their disposal we're now just about on the field goal range Louis could not hang on third and seven from the clock down to 33 seconds pretty good pressure right there in the face think that was Malthus working against cameron fleming the replacement tackle out there we'll see if he can start to get something going because now instead of always dropping we're seeing a little more pressure out of the Colts 37 they send Gronkowski wide right brady's fires over the middle Adelman makes the catch flag is down and Edelman stand on his feet clock goes to 24 Frank is in the offensive and that's Sebastian Ballmer that takes them out of field goal range remember Sebastian Ballmer now forced to go to the left tackle position instead of his typical right tackle position you see the hands to the face maybe twice on the same play we'll get spotted at the 41 of the course a 59yard field I don't not that the sastra couldn't do it 13:17 here's a big day much better reigns to the 22 and and pick up the first down as well and Brady says let's get up there and Spike it save the timeout by the timeout has already been taken that looked like an avalanche coming at them watch this screen setup here as they get off to this side and now there I mean there's five guys out in front of that thing so defensively you knew it had to be something like that where that is painful to give up one of those in that situation Edelman good block balls 222 look at that again that's a convoy Brady meanwhile is 14 to 23 already thrown for 201 yards little surprise we haven't seen more screens because the Colts keep dropping so many people into coverage and when they do that it's so easy to get it space to try and get behind those big offensive linemen I would expect to see more of that if the Colts tase own matrix Clark was 17 seconds he uses the middle again still spiking said he's gonna go No Toller with Keshawn Martin flag down at the 10 today they will probably call this illegal contact but the ball was in the air when that contact occurred so if they're calling a legal contact house interference sir well officiated there contact right out here well beyond five yards obviously there's the contact and the ball was in the air nice job by the officials and now a big play yeah you could see the ball in the frame pass interference now it's a 7 12 seconds Thank You Patrick appearance so the eggs buffalo bill was pushing off Brady blocking at the official probably not needed Scott Chandler is sixfootseven going up against Toller there's some bumping you can see kind of had his hand on the facemask there and just sort of kept him from jumping himself right there there was plenty of content through this play this game is starting to shape up almost exactly how we thought it might a lot of people thought it might be like twenty four nothing at the half instead it's probably going to be a onepoint game this is a 35yard field goal for steven gustav ski it's a Belichick we're trying to do it again in the first half with the possession and a score and then get the ball again we talked about the fact he always defers when he wins the coin toss double whamming they've done it 14 times since o9 scoring on the final possession of the half and again after receiving the second hand kickoff the only time he ever took the ball was on a rainy day in Cincinnati a few years ago apart from that we defer and it's worked brilliantly you know what was the biggest play of this half with all those big plays in the half is the fact that Donte Moncrief who probably did recover that onside kick was not awarded the ball because you didn't have the conclusive look at it but you can imagine if they have recovered that what this half might have looked like really an excellent half by the Colts as you said there were a lot of people with the way the Patriots have been playing this year that thought this one was going to be a blowout the Indianapolis Colts have matched any emotion that the Patriots brought into this house Patriots big favorites big road favorites coming into the game it's a onepoint game this will be a touchback probable kneel down from the 20yard line the teams will go to the locker room it's been fun yeah really good guy really good game you know and for Andrew Luck he had such a tough start but they were against two really tough defenses that he started this season against the Jets and the bills and really never got it going until the fourth quarter against Tennessee and so the backandforth first half Kings exchanging the leaves greatly still arguing that goal the side judge passed at the second half",

  "transcript": "here we are on the road to Super Bowl 50 and here's a memory for you Willie McGinest played four Super Bowls with the Patriots winning three of them making plays and tonight recognized as a member now of the patriot wall fan just a moment ago Robert Kraft there to welcome woody well he calls Willie his firstborn is v write his first Patriot draft pick out of us see back in 1994 Willie doing a lot of great television work and also doing a lot for youth football out in Long Beach California yeah great ambassador for the game there's no question maybe he spurred his Patriots team on tonight because what do you say except total domination Miami's offense can do nothing they're not making a play that even gets close to scaring this Pacers defense it's a tenth is attacking all night long so they got to make some plays and back them up all right let's take a State Farm look at this a little double check highlight from the first half presented by State Farm Brady to Gronkowski that opening drive rhythmic fuel to buy that screen pass on the third can 16 to Dion Lewis Lewis just I think was the real difference maker in this first two quarters of action it's amazing in it well look at the first half stats the think of Dion Lewis they lose Shane Vereen Wow one of the best running backs that catches the football out of the backfield and outside Dion Lewis steps in and has done a terrific job how about the total yards you know it's big of course for the Patriots 241 but the Miami defense was on the field the whole time their offense never gave them a rest there's Landry back on the in line he had four catches for 38 yards in the first half and half of the dolphin total yardage 76 yards it's all by Anakin Buster now this mouse key will put it on a tee here as it's been ball New England so far waited here last December it was a similar type game in that New England dominated a bad occasion winning by four touchdowns with the expected touch back and we're gonna take it right down to the sideline Tracie it's all yours well thanks Jim dan Campbell wants his impact players to step up he wants more production on first and second down and he wants his offense to stop shooting themselves in the foot he said that he told them in the locker room keep pounding the rock do not lose hope there's a whole half left they're still in this game and remember this is the first time they faced adversity under Dan Campbell as a head coach Jim Payne adversity as well on that offensive line JaJuan James with a toe injury early on he has not returned to the lineup here to start this first drive of the second half he's got Landrum's what we saw one right at the very end of the first half back it's good for 15 more well that was a good play to start the second half to get some confidence for Landry and Ryan Tannehill they usually make that fake and the wide receiver goes across the field that time Jarvis Landry stopped broke back outside candy Hill on the money Landry who had two touchdown catches against the Texans last week and had eighty four receptions last year as a rookie a banner rookie class of receivers a year ago he had the second most catches of the rooks Tannehill and he gets it to Miller lowers his shoulder runs into Ryan after eight or nine well nice safe throw by Ryan Tannehill but you know when you get chances like this what's the scene go up here you know they're gonna do it send them vertical and they got the shot they want but early in the second half you're trying to build confidence so Ryan Tannehill playing it safe can't blame and gets the completion he's connected on his last five passes he's got a second of two there's milk his pista head might have even been a little help by to run Harmon the safety for the Patriots pushing him forward first down for the Dolphins how about this run defense we said it many times why do you even try to get outside they smother that and every time they've done it look at the what you call setting the edge they do it it's preached to them consciously about Matt Patricia and Bill Belichick then they do it very well last week Miami had six rushes of at least 10 yards big gains so far tonight they have 13 yards on the ground for the evening now as Kenny Stills and certainly could have made a difference here on this drive to try to change the momentum would have been near the 20yard line well it's a perfect throw kitty stills is probably their speed receiver the guy they like to get down the field at the very last second Jim you can see takes his eyes off the football because he sees the safety coming over and it allows Coleman to knock it out we're now receiving word from the Dolphins sideline that tawan James is out for the rest of the game fights our blitzing Miller picked him up and Tannehill got the throw away just barely and again this time it's still after them dropped on the previous play this time he holds on and picks up 23 beats Patrick chongo to come across the field they crossed the receivers then boy Ryan Tannehill hangs in there takes a hit that puts the football right on the money and was a tough throw to make wasn't it it was him tight coverage but tough to stay with receivers when they're crossing the field and the defensive back sees the other receiver his teammate slows him down just enough to create that separation they've got the rookie first round receiver you may have seen him in there Devante Parker in as Tannehill flushed out on it's caught at the two yardline by Jordan Cameron well nice job really great job by Ryan Tannehill get the outside to pocket and something that he does very well throwing on the run and Chandler Jones gets caught inside allows him outside and makes that motion take off boy beautiful spiral great technique and first catch of the night for Cameron hmm Chung got a little nicked and I got to tell you so did Brandon Albert the left tackle Cheung comes out and the Dolphins have a first and goal to go from the two it's Miller Miller powering ahead looks like he's across and he is for the touchdown Oh a great read by Miller that time patient enough to see the block and get between or get to the right of the center well that's a little change in attitude from the first half isn't it it sure was you think oh they're gonna not make this work because you saw the drop pass by Kenny Stills but what a move by Ryan Tannehill they look good he's had time he destroyed the football well he's on the football well all year long would give in time he was four out of five on that drive was Tannehill for seventyfive yards and then Miller takes it the final two to put Miami on the board mr. point is good dan Campbell said I want my playmakers to make some plays and we saw it on that drive pink in the first three and a half minutes of the third they exceed the yardage total from the first half and they matched the five first downs they had in the first two quarters and Miami shows a little life offensively for the first time it'll make that defense back up and think a little bit after that Drive well they won't be in attack mode like they were in the first half while it seemed like every play a since 2000 AFC East head coaches Campbell the eighth for Miami Ryan becomes the eighth for Buffalo and of course he's one of five for the Jets since 2000 and there's the low man yep with his poor Super Bowl titles matching Chuck Noll rady of course with just only one NFL head coach and just three offensive coordinators his entire career Charlie Weis Bill O'Brien and Josh McDaniels for the second time around it's done anything rushing to football two carries no yardage in the first half that's his best run after a big first half catching the football well you just watch you don't the say anything try to tackle him when he's hit out here into open space screen playing wide lines up as a wide receiver then of course not covered but the one thing Bill Belichick says about Dion Lewis he's not just a little gimmick guy he goes if we put him in the backfield he's good enough to run the football in between the tackles we'll start number 71 offense fiveyard penalty still first down these running backs catching the football kevin faulk who was here for so many years and contributed on those championship teams danny woodhead and Shane Vareen of course off to the Giants this year Dion Lewis keeps the quickest of them all Phil here's Brady's pass for this game about three yards short of the first yeah I think he is he's definitely the quickest of all and maybe the most virtus versatile when you talk about all those running backs watch Tom Brady lead Gronkowski past the linebacker he knew he was in trouble softened up with a drone and Rob gun Kowski ran right into it second and three was Lewis look at the cuts he's making and has them first down he went to Pitt following in the footsteps of LeSean McCoy I ended up with the Eagles and played behind him learned so much from his buddy laid there for a short while and then went to Cleveland he had a broken leg in the second preseason game back in 2013 and here he is we talked about him in you know a couple weeks ago I think the Patriots have had their eye on him for quite a while they finally had a chance to get him in the camp a little hurt during the preseason but once he got healthy they have found how to use it nice job by Jelani Jenkins turning around and running right into the ball carrier watch original NFL shows and catch what is trending around the league with the allnew NFL now watch in March on NFL mobile your connected TV devices or go to nfl.com slash now you know you talked about this page which team and just think of all the different offenses a different style of players we've seen the big receivers throw it down the field then it was you know power running when they first started and then now we see small receivers different types of running backs just a creative all players for another purse front house keys fifth catch of the night over 80 yards total and a touchdown you know you say the first thing we're going to do when we play the Patriots we're going to take away Rob Gronkowski that is so easy to say and almost impossible to do unless you have the guy that can cover him oneonone at all times let's talk because he lines up everywhere he goes in motion and he's so big even if you cover him good just push you off first out of the 38 Patriots speaking of big chunks of yardage on their first possession of the second half another nine that time make it in look easy they're trying some different stuff on the defensive side Earl Mitchell that time the the inside defensive lineman dropped back as the middle linebacker Tom Brady they've done so many crossing routes in his career watch number nine to get back there big Earl Mitchell he's big but not much of a finger in the pass game second and not even a foot trying to get it the Blount just pull ahead for the first before yard gain for blonde well many styles they can play right when you watch it screens you know quick passes play action go to give it to Dion Lewis in let's bring in one of the biggest one backs in the lead okay or pluck and now hurry up and this push down snap it's into the secondary before the safety is run over but gets credit for the tackle Jones holds him to nine Schad Jones sees it does a great job of getting in the proper lane to stop it from being even a bigger game his blown again he has grabbed around the shoulder pads and stopped for no gain as again it's Jones in on the tackle long with Earl Mitchell you got a third down and they've gone to this hurry up approach it is the always when we do a game up here or wherever we do a game with the New England Patriots the number one fear of every defensive coordinator because they're afraid they won't get lined up in the proper spots leave somebody uncovered no matter how you practice it it's hard to be ready for it when the action is real third they really need about to hear rainy steps hop and incomplete pocket was collapsing and ended up trying to ditch it to LaFell and they'll have now just aus key come out and try to set the record alone for most consecutive field goals made in Patriot history coverage who was good at first Edelman he couldn't tried to move in the pocket to throw it you know they had eight birdies on Tom Brady this defense did the first half that's all you can expect regarding it you know the fact that they run so many different type of plays so now for the record for 26 consecutive makes from 36 out the Stauskas kit dead center it has the record now and by the way that's 49 straight makes at home crazy numbers 22 to 7 Hank Gaston ski and the Patriots the margins still two scores it's a win for the Miami defense in the end absolutely pull them to three this one is going to be returned from the goal line it's Landry he's not sort of the 20 it's an epidural the special teams tackle Freeney got their also let's see if Miami's offense continued the role we saw the last time they had the football New England scoring when his first drive of the second half for the seventh time in the seven games this season every third quarter first drive they put up points three touchdowns four field goals now with dolphins nubert he's got four or five yearns with that one what did you see out of the Dolphins it was different in that last driver staff they went down the field with the football and mantoman coverage and made some plays but here was the play of the drive he you would hope if he gets the opportunity Ryan Tannehill he would break the pocket to try to create plays just like that I know this the coaching staff they do not discourage him from running if you see a gap take off look down the field the receivers got enough speed to break away if you give him a second move out of the gun with a pair of tight ends Sims and Cameron and a whistle both start number14 offense fiveyard penalty still second down by the way week 8 continues Sunday morning live from London at a special time 9:30 a.m. Eastern on Fox and then check your local listings for the one o'clock set of games on CBS and Fox including San Diego at Baltimore congratulations to Phillip Rivers and his wife Tiffany the little baby girl Claire was born last night to that great family here's a second and 11 and Hill steps up throws he's got Landry for a first down is blocked by Dion Sims on Ning kovitch yep kept him on the outside allowed Tannehill to step up and make the play and again they've run a lot of routes across the field I think New England is expecting those crossing routes and a good misdirection Brown is thinking bitch gets to hit on the quarterback but nice job you want your star players to make the play that's Jarvis Landry is that the wide receiver position is lit up yeah he's got six catches for 71 yards when you set it down he's back over to Matthews but Dan Campbell one of a number of former Titans in league who went on to become head coaches like the great Mike Ditka Mike theis Ken Whisenhunt he comes from a little town in Texas Morgan Texas family owned a ranch we read help heard hundred head of cattle went on the Texas A&amp;M to play drafted in the third round by the Giants back in 99 he thought he was gonna be there start tied in a few years later they drafted a guy named Jeremy Shockey draw play and Miller and just a couple came into the league it looked a little bit like late the Clay Matthews of his time yeah and they good look five years as an assistant primarily as the tight end coach now the head coach and again the youngest in the league at 39 he went from the Giants aftershock he came on board went to the Cowboys thought this is going to be my chance then they go and draft a guy named Jason Witten his first NFL touchdown catch was as a member of the Giants against Tennessee off the hands of Kerry Collins his first win was punching against Tennessee here's a third and one look at the Patriots step up and it's a Linga on Miller right away and the Dolphins drive comes to an end watch him go this way Hicks Salenko the disc eight can't block them as they slant get up the field they were slanting to the offenses right then Miami couldn't make the blocks it's that was a big stop for the Patriots who or and more importantly awful miss by the Miami Dolphins well take a limb armillary at that hundred and 75 yard effort on the ground and he only played the first half against Houston he's got only 15 on the ground tonight on nine carries but one of them went for a touchdown that's not what they were asking dar to do right there fly it into the middle of the endzone for a net of 38 Patriots up 20 to 7 in the third we're just a couple of nights away from the candy chase trickortreating and this video courtesy of Bronx father Gordy here throwback Thursday it's Rob at the age of five during a kindergarten celebration in Williamsville New York and look at the hands back then yeah that's right and did you see the not the anger but the force he was trying to hit that whip so what's the old saying if they bite when they're young they're gonna bite when they're old some football player with great hand they had the size advantage of five also somebody city was five cent a slot to the left on first down talked the fingertips of Scott Chandler and again next Thursday reminder we've got the Browns at the Bengals will Cincinnati go into that game still unbeaten they've got a play at Pittsburgh this Sunday the game will have on CBS but next Thursday NFL Network only when Thursday Night Football Browns Bengals second and 10 bring it down the field you saw from Williamsville New York at the age of five Gronkowski 4:24 they love this play they created two tight ends one goes inside of the scene the other one goes outside everybody in the league tries to duplicate it hard to do unless you got a tight in like grid Kowski Chandler he's over a hundred with a sixth catch and as newest slips gets to his feet and the for progress might be back near the line of scrimmage actually you know mark him back as a loss of two he's hit so far Brady talking about his distribution seven wideouts seven passes to the tight ends at six the Rob Gronkowski won the Chandler and seven to the running backs primarily that being Willis second and 12 pressure down the side just out of reach for Lewis who was trying to beat Grimes on the play Brent Grimes probably going finally somebody that's my size out here to cover you've seen cover oneonone against some of them always the the best receiver the other team Calvin Johnson whatever this week a little different Julian Edelman beyond Lewis good coverage small window to throw it into a minute to go in the third a fastmoving third quarter third and 12 grading the time the direction of Luis and Miami defense shuts down the Patriots near midfield forcing upon ya coverage was really good down the field they're gonna make sure Cameron wake he couldn't get there but they have a guy in the middle made Tom Brady pull it down this is Brady's reaction meanwhile Cameron Wake is still down on the field he got he got blocked by on the outside Michael Williams the tight in he was going to be doubleteamed and didn't see what happened I know he got pushed way outside though oh just one of the reasons why Jim we've seen him they try to pace his number of plays they've kept him out you know any time he does he's explosive player and when you have hamstring problems which he did the first four weeks of the year you have to worry about it here he is 91 yeah Michael Michael Williams oh yeah right away you could see him pull up well now he has to be assisted to the sidelines well that's a big big loss for the football team they've already lost lost JaJuan James the right tackle which is affected a few plays here tonight you know when you have a backup tackle in their defensive ends are going to take advantage of it this Miami offense to series this half they moved it down the field the first time for the touchdown second time that looked like they're going to kind of pick up right where they had left off the last Drive before the Patriot defense stopped them but you see enough out of them right now to think that the Dolphins yes and do something here with about 16 minutes to go in the game I do I think they're gonna have it they they're gonna get some chances to make those plays down the field and you know I'm not looking at this game in no way thinking this is locked up the Patriots have it one so the drive gets you things if you're a Dolphins fan there's Allen with his fifth punt of the night and he's had some good ones hitting the Dolphins deep 38 yards gets it done as Tannehill and Miami will begin at the 11th Jim Nantz Phil Simms Tracy Wolfson Mike Carey on board here as well wallet Lance barrel my carnal producing and directing Thursday night football from the twelve Tannehill works the minute it is too steep dangerous throw in the direction of Landry if little dangerous had to be careful with it had to get it over the top of rob minkoff itch so that's what made him throw it just out of the reach of Landry look what's happening with Cameron wake being taken inside second and ten it's the Matthews he gets out to about the 20 which will set up a third and about two tonight for prospects try out for a chance to make it to training camp on undrafted then football town Barrow Alaska the Whalers continue to fight for a playoff spot to hit NFL Network original series tonight after the post game only on NFL Network and the Dolphins pick up a first down here in the closing seconds of the third quarter we call it third and three and that's good for the first two Matthews and that'll run out time in quarter number three there was Tannehill they also had Miller open on the left side but he found Matthews 22 seven Patriots after three will return after this message and a word from your local station 15 minutes to go Bella checking the Patriots trying to steer the ship to shore here and pick up a seventh win in seven games on the season but Miami you set it down to start the quarter with the swing pass over to Miller and that side closed down by McCord Ian Butler held to only three here's a little look at play distribution under Philbin when they would go with two tight ends two wide outs that personnel grouping under Philbin only 7% of the time of course kamboja former tight end almost 40% of the time and when he's gone to that grouping for Campbell has averaged over at 8 yards of play Phil well he said it X tight in he wants the team to be more physical than if you want to accomplish edged him you put more tight ends in the game but being physical sure didn't work here tonight second of 7 pass intercepted but this time Harmon gets to his feet Tannehill comes in and makes the tackle off his own interception seem to be a little miscommunication there yeah the old yeah I thought you were going here and said you went there as he threw the football I think he was expecting Matthews to break outside he kept going up the scene and that is some catch by Harmon for the intercept well you're not kidding but he was expecting to receive her the inside receiver to go outside he didn't and this is what you do when you're really upset with an interception as a quarterback got to be careful but you go in there and try to make a tackle second interception thrown tonight my Tannehill and from the 15 it settlement for five Edelman's fourth catch another see Tannehill rishard Matthews talking about that play that's twice I think he's targeting him and may throws that they've been intercepting evening so boy Herrmann just laying out for that pick you'd like to have your wide receivers be able to make catches like that much less your safeties second and five there's Brady under pressure and it's incomplete as he hits the ground and we've got a patriot linemen knocked down as Trey Jackson the right garden and he's got sue in the area might have stepped on too with Trey Jackson is just now getting help to his feet there was nothing sinister that happened on this play he got tangled up with Sue and then got hit low by Olivia Vernon and he immediately clutches that left knee and now they're down to their last offensive lineman as Ryan when del will come in for him they only dress six tonight party of course with Nate's older on IR and Marcus cannon inactive tonight because of a toe injury when della very experienced player to take over Jackson's position at right guard third and five reaches across alertly for another touchdown for New England Cashin it off the Hartmann interception Edelman to the outside really simple round everybody the league runs it guy in the back of the insole Adelman hooks up somebody in the flat and that's an awesome job of catching a football and staying off the ground as you scored the touchdown and they'll confirm it the knee was never down the Patriots have just scored in a 27th straight quarter they did not score in the past quarter in the opening game of Thursday game it was against Pittsburgh but every quarter after that they put up points Harmon sets it up takeaway points for New England ending with Edelman well moon over New England New England over Miami 29 to 7 little different atmosphere for this Miami team a step up in talent no question talked about him we first started the game gymnast it's tough they can grind it out physically and mentally for the cheeks today we'll get the turn the Starsky got and slowed him down but when the better returns you'll see against the special teams unit of the Patriots a 50yard run back that stamp we talked about before consecutive quarters scored 27 quarters longest on the league in ten years Thursday night football now only on NFL Network beginning next Thursday the first place Bengals take on the Browns AFC North showdown Thursday Night Football again eight o'clock next Thursday only on NFL Network off the big return by Landry from midfield pressure Tannehill ducking and down Chung comes out of the secondary and Ning kovitch is on him as well in a loss of 10 Jason Fox a right tackle Nick a bitch here comes Chung when there's nobody else back there you've got five linemen hard to pick up an edge Blitzer New England taking advantage of the formation Miami gets to the line rather quickly before the Patriots but it doesn't matter Hightower is all over Tannehill and backtoback sacks by the Patriots this is what happened to this team early in the year 77 Billie Jenkins the right guard gets beat they got behind they start throwing the football and the offensive line is just not ready to be able to protect down after down in obvious passing situations and now third and 28 and pushback Jonas Gray by cheong his old teammate and that series was a disaster for Miami backtoback sacks on the field for barely a minute you know Jim some of the things we talked about they couldn't get outside they're not a power running team so Azzam work I don't want to call them they're gimmick plays all the screens of quick throws we've seen none of that tonight why because the Patriots they took them all away they were gonna make them throw it down the field and tight coverage we've had some successful at night made the right decision to your point not fielding these punts deep special teams are excellent here in New England we got an update now on Cameron wait Tracy let's go down to here that's right Jim after further evaluation in the locker room it is an Achilles injury for Cameron wake and he is out for the game as for Patriots offensive lineman trae Jackson he is questionable with a left knee injury Jim okay to be rough news for the Dolphins another star players is blunt but sit outside Stefan's trailers got 13 let's blunt up to 60 on the night on the ground yeah just you know we've said it so many times this time even Julian element gets in or gets the block as a garrote blunt so big can run inside but the ability just to bounce it out the Patriots what do they do on the offensive side it doesn't matter what game they play throw it every day on a run they just wear you down with everything they can do looks like for a moment that might be a little too much congestion on the exchange but they still able to dart ahead with blunt for another nine it's pretty amazing you come into the game we're talking about what's the biggest advantage for the Miami Dolphins in the game is that right yeah they're gonna be the defensive line against the offensive line of the New England couldn't wait to see if this is gonna even things out maybe and what a job by the Patriots Josh McDaniels the game plan protecting a beatup offensive line it still making it work very well at second anymore blunt bring it inside ten minutes before they have another snap that's a first down carry Sunday the NFL on CBS brings out regional action many of you're gonna see Cincinnati again the Bengals unbeaten taking on Pittsburgh San Diego with Baltimore Tennessee at Houston late some of you will get the Jets at Oakland all beginning at noon eastern with JP and the crew on the NFL today you just watch what they do on the offensive side we've said it many times give a lot of credit to Bill Belichick over the years CNN the rule changes they lead countless everything was turning towards the offensive side he's built his team around it with the catch Brady goes over 300 on the night with that completion well seventh time now the Brady's past 300 yards against Miami rain his career sorry Jim write down the scene there one of the best seam throwing football right so write down where the tackles and Titans line up or in the slots they do it three or four times a game we saw it earlier with a big throw down the field and there's one that time the LaFell that's been a staple of the offense ever since Bill Belichick has been here on the 29 he's got Adelman again jumps away from the first hit and he's down to the 10 and Brady's gonna hurry him up to the line so many weapons you know you ever heard people talk about it they go Tom Brady just doesn't have all the skilled players around him then some of these other quarterbacks do in the NFL I just laugh but what game are you watching Greg Cal ski you see Edelman all the unique running backs and the one thing that they've done ever since he's been a quarterback here Tim the one thing what's your greatest asset your quarterback so Bill Belichick has tried to keep what has an offensive line in front of his greatest asset next Tom Brady then he wants to play another ten years he just said recently here he is in trouble and he's twisted down at the 16 and he's furious about it never satisfied and when you you know you and I will watch the sack the pocket finally collapses and Vernon got he gets him but when you watch Tom Brady play ever since college at Michigan that labia has always been any but that edge to to be a fierce competitor second and goal back at the 16 the touchdown catch they work so hard on to keep its arm youthful drill the Bell before you did even as he gunk in like we've said a couple times tonight thrown as good as ever look how tall he stays and just rips it he's got a four touchdown I'd Edelman on both of his touchdown catches gets contacted about the two but he still dives ahead and finds the goal line you know he's like a golfer that's on the PGA Tour you know he's not satisfied with being out there they have success we want to keep working on that swing it's the 24th time in Brady's remarkable career he's had a four touchdown night you look at his level of a play filled at the age of 38 again he says he wants to play in over 10 years all this offseason hysteria about deflategate all the criticism conjecture that came with it and again the NFL this week appealing that to judge Berman decision do you think just watching him play now up to 20 touchdowns only one interception on the year has this whole thing raised his motivation give him a bigger chip than you've ever seen in his career you know it heart it'd be hard for me to say yeah he's more motivated Jim because I think his motivation has been great ever since we've seen him in the league but I think there's no doubt almost hate this way more determination get out there watch and you know you see it when he plays I just saw him smile it seems like I never seemed smile on the sidelines you know but even after all this great success but I see it in the interviews when you watch him on TV and could he play another 10 years it's it possible could he play 248 I don't think so but listen it's a great thing to say he's just trying to tell everybody I'm not near the end and if Bill Belichick is still the head coach and if Josh McDaniels stays here is the offensive coordinator it's going to be a lot of good years ahead I'll tell you that here's Dan a hill Matthews for eight just seven minutes remaining foots Tannehill over 200 no touchdowns two picks well you know not a great night for Ryan Tannehill but there's no question he's a franchise quarterback down in Miami except a first down to Jordan Cameron we need to see a team when you look at the Dolphins Jim we talked about it for for the last few days it's a team in transition Dan Campbell takes over you got to get everything organized the quarterback there's no doubt they gave him the contract you got to build around into giving more opportunities completion you know the AFC East now that the Patriots on their way now to having defeated the first goround in the division all three of the opponents since 2001 the quarterbacks to win the AFC East have only been two others and guess what the two others the same guy CAD Pennington is a jet and is a member of the Dolphins in o8 who knows I see Tom Brady on the sidelines an offense that was worried about certain things coming in this game you know Angela nice cut to pick up the first down now you know you got the Jets at four and two so then it was certainly a long way to go in this season and the Jets played the Patriots really tight last Sunday let going into the fourth quarter but having won against the bills and the Dolphins tonight the Jets last week with another round to go against all the division foes but they're on the way at this point Pass is caught heard on the mark there wins stills you know the seven and oh this is a team trying to win the division for a seventh consecutive time that hasn't happened in the league since back in the early 70s with the Los Angeles Rams beautiful throw at last play by Tannehill two steals from the 28th my time cheers to time and it's locked down out of the hands of Landry Butler Harmon McCourty there were three Patriots defending you know Dante Hightower and Jamie Collins number 54 comes around the edge big linebackers who can stop the run but what we're seeing Laura Jim is them playing defensive end especially Hightower blitzing up the middle this Patrick's defense you know last week they had their hands full against the Jets who our team to look out for no question but they're going to get better I thought before the season you just watch them to briefly this team had a chance to be every bit as good as the team they won the Super Bowl last year second down and 10 rushed out and thrown away it's been an odd start to the year in a lot of ways around the lake film when you'd consider that we have the most teams undefeated through week seven since the 70 merger yet we have the fewest number of teams that have a winning record there are only six other teams with a winning record so you've got these five Patriots gonna be the first now to get to seven and oh here tonight Bengals at Pittsburgh Green Bay and Denver they'll be playing in the Mile High City on Sunday it was Carolina be hosting Indianapolis third and ten over to Matthews trying to set some blockers up for him over there but the Patriots help bust it up you're fourth down coming up of course they're gonna go for it field goals does nothing and do you think they were rolling everything was all excitement hey we were excited about the Miami Dolphins tonight in reality hit him here tonight you see how far they are being a championship team fortune five I'm going as sims hauls it in wasn't going to be the easiest position to be in because it's a complicated week anytime you play the Patriots and when you have the short week yeah on top of it you're traveling get a new defensive coordinator so that's tough on him getting ready for an offense that does so many different things new head coach has been on the job for couple weeks end zone and just mount of reach for stills so after tonight the East looks like this Miami and New England meet for the second time week 17 on January the 3rd whether you look at the Dolphins open 3 in the division taken down by McCourty Mayo was giving chase also before tea once again off the outside that was Patrick Chung long time they switched positions this time McCord he comes same blitz nobody there to block him gets the sack yeah that's the fifth sack registered by the patriot defense and now third and 23 Ryan had an interception earlier in this game till they lost Darrelle Revis everybody thought boy this is going to be such a completely different team what will they do I think they got better up front and they place so much of this type of comfort gym where they just play mantoman and they're getting better at this as a year goes along but that's what you have to do in this league now if you can't cover a rush but knock down passes like that but the quarterbacks and receivers we see around the league you're gonna be in big trouble they've got to get all the way to the seven for a first fourth down play and the matrix would take over on downs Armen back there rookie Justin Coleman as well Thursday night football again only on NFL Network starting next week the Bengals and the brown hello is in at quarterback that's white at running back Jimmy Garoppolo in his second year out of Eastern Illinois takes over as Brady retires for the evening another stubborn performance bill yep I mean just a terrific performance and you know I have a chance and you do too to talk to the coaches and players and I mean we felt the great concern when the coaches of the patients about the matchups which he talked about it doesn't really matter Jim when we talk about the Patriots no matter what happens they're gonna score you got to find a way to score 30 points they have a chance to beat outside number 78 defense lined up in the neutral zone five yard penalty remains second down to your point on this 30 point discussion got to put up 30 they put up 28 in the first game against Pittsburgh and every game now after that they scored at least 30 more than 30 you know you and I sit around talk about what give us some keys of the game and everything and my first key for the Miami Dolphins is what how do you score over 30 because no matter what you do to this Patriots offense they figure it out during the game and they find the matchups that they want for they exploited for that's white a prominent role in the game last week and he's not back for a loss of one you start looking down the line at the Patriots schedule they got some games the likes of at Denver we're gonna see him down at the New York Giants have got a game at the New York Jets but this is a team that already the whispers are out there it's just gonna be like that well team of a few years ago that went through the regulars they're not gonna stop back to this game those whispers that's for sure coming up next the Mazda postgame show interviews and analysis of tonight's game date rates get the mini by this weekend and then will be back at home a week from Sunday hosting the Redskins that'll be the national late afternoon game on CBS November 15 at the New York Giants often the nemesis for New England yeah I would say that's a good word for it Buffalo comes here at Denver you ever notice just watching the Patriots sideline just watching Tom Brady Thursday Night Football but we here at costly it's such a grind for the guys to get ready but they all say the same thing boy it's going to be great to get the weekend off and just think when you win man that just makes the weekend much of course that makes it much much school third and final hello and he stacked up by the Dolphins who will force him to punt and one last chance for the Dolphins offense to try to do a little something here move the football a little bit but they've had so far Miami only 14 yards rushing and that would be if it remains at that figure it would be the third lowest total rushing in a game in Miami's history this is coming off of a Miller alone last we got huntin 75 yep and a half see the back deep from the five yard I don't know if it says something about the Patriots defense or the two teams they played before the Miami Dolphins it is 57yard punt ladies night first across Kowski on the opening drive Lewis Durant especially in that first half a huge part of things then twice fine in the second half an element tonight moved out to Los Angeles so that he could get maybe some practice reps in the offseason with Brady and quite a chemistry was formed this summer Adelman and and Amendola joined brady up at a vacation home in Montana they've worked running routes starting at 6:00 in the morning at altitude extreme altitude watch this game all the quarterbacks watch each other there's a lot to learn from Tom Brady and the fact is you can keep your skill level high as you get older Tom Brady 38 and you know that's what you got to do you got to keep working at your craft and why what makes you successful he's a great quarterback because he takes the football around among many other stills catch and a first down and again the Mazda postgame show will come up all the interviews and analysis of today's game there we go closing out seconds here tipped up in the air incomplete we'll have the Browns at the Bengals next week yeah and if they may morrow a little line that was used around here one time it's for us on the Cincinnati here we go you know the talking about the Bengals looking forward to seeing them next week what a difference getting some of their players back that they didn't have in the playoff game we did last year when they played the Indianapolis Colts they're all offenses maybe not point is explosive or as good as the patrons as been this year that will do it pick up the big gain with that last one where the little consequence says velvet check in the Patriots now in the

  "transcript": "Miami coming in on quite a roll taking on New England this AFC East were the Patriots tonight try to go right through all three teams the first goround in divisional play but if Miami wins things get a whole lot more interesting in that division friends I'm here of course with the Giants legend Phil Simms when we looked at this game a couple of weeks ago on this schedule it didn't look all that interesting it does now well being here in this stadium you can feel the excitement I think even the New England Patriots fans knows this Miami team has won they've been impressive it's gonna be exciting to watch these matchups and Campbell has changed the culture over the last 11 days with those two impressive performances but what are they in store for tonight at New England where they're going up against the big bad monster monster here there's no doubt about you talk about the Patriots they're so tough they're tough at home but the thing about that nobody gives them credit for we know they're tough on the field physically but mentally they can play 60 minutes never break down and stay with the place that's what Miami's up against take a look at the lineups presented by the Lincoln Motor Company we'll begin here with the Miami offense and it's a good offensive line a couple of Pro Bowlers and Brandon Albert or as well as Mike Pouncy and of course they've got playmakers for Tannehill in Landry and Miller what do you see in the quarterback year Phil well I like the way he's playing this is a very interesting offense they love to get outside of the defensive ends hey how about a quarterback sweep to the left that's blocked very well by the offensive linemen they do a lot of this faint screens one way throw it's the other two get outside on the edge they got fast players and here's the playmaker to look for Jarvis Landry does it all reverses catches passes down the field they got a fast offense yeah Landry and Miller were fantasy football dreams last week in the game against Houston here is the New England offense the coordinator Matt Patricia Chandler Jones tied for the league lead in sacks Collins man he makes an impact on virtually every down he's out there and of course Butler is their number one corner we're gonna talk about the biggest matchup to watch tonight this offensive line against the D line of Miami because they're injured at New England and they're inexperienced but they've heard that before the season Gronk coming off 11 catches a career high and Tom Brady what can you say at this point at age 38 still defying age and maybe having his best start ever that's what you say he's defying age and he's adapted himself to the NFL we see quarterbacks moving around more and more I'm not saying he's a threat descrambler went everywhere but moving to find open receivers down the field and maybe the biggest play of the game last week against the New York Jets scrambling for a big first down that led to a score all right against that offensive line this the ffensive front Suh and wake over the last two games have come for eight sacks that's the matchup to watch this Miami defense in the secondary features Rashad Jones he has picked sixes each of the last two games what about that matchup I'm looking forward to a gym this is going to be tough those defensive pass Russell's from Miami have great speed tough test for the New England offensive line New England on a beautiful vine in Foxborough and its government next we're back at New England get except now for Miami against the Patriots we've got Mike Kerry on stamp bhai in the booth that down on the sidelines Tracy Wolfson Tracy down to you well thanks a lot Jim I had a chance to speak with Dan Campbell this week and he told me that his goal taking over this team was to become more physical as a team to be more competitive on and off the field and he said to have fun said isn't that why they played the game we play the game and so that's what he's provided in practice whether it's tug of wars news be throws oneonone drills he has even encourages players do touchdown dances in the end zone during practice and you can see his players have responded they are showing more passion and then I had a chance to ask Dan Campbell and I said are you having more fun he looked at me he said Jim I'm having a blast as coach of the league at 39 out of Morgan Texas grew up on a ranch Texas tonight's game ping broadcast in Spanish were available using the si P button on your television thank you for watching the NFL Thursday night kickoff show presented by the Lincoln Motor Company we're very fortunate to be born New Englanders is we have the best sports fan base the Celtics the Bruins the Red Sox over the past 15 years we've had the best football team in the country it's been great they just keep on winning they've won four Super Bowls dynasty and nobody can deny that Tom Brady is my entire life I love him Tom Brady is the best quarterback in the NFL Brady could play with anybody anybody could play with high schoolers who still win he's probably one of the betterlooking players on the Patriots he's really cute he's really handsome very yeah you guys can intimate dude he's right yeah he's pretty good Isles pretty good there's a little problem though deflategate oh my god okay that was a setup the whole thing I think was grounded based on jealousy this Mickey mess father you admit you guys definitely have scandal is all just a big waste of time and that's not we're on to the next question oh my god he's so awesome AZ yeah he has to be the best coach in the league Belichick he never smiles he keeps all of his emotions into that hoodie it's not the best choice of clothing not really it's good for like a dad I guess hey man hey watch it I think the Dolphins are definitely gonna be a tough team to beat the Pats are probably have a little bit of trouble to get just a teeny tiny bit know what we're going said I don't know they're a good team but they're not great like the Patriots they're not as wonderful as just saying yes better watch out because we're coming for you football starts here the youthful exuberance of the New England fans and some young dolphin fans don't forget about them and we're getting set now for the kickoff and we don't always still start out making a big deal about the coin toss and the decisions made but Miami won the toss and elected to defer defer and kick into the win and here's why I think they did it Jim you said it in the opening what's New England worried about their offensive line Miami says let's go out there and see how our defensive line matches up right away I think that's why they defer Franks the rookie kicker for the Dolphins down the field to Hammond or the big leg through the back to the endzone so Tom Brady and the Patriots from the 20 and Brady with these again crazy numbers 16 touchdowns only one interception what will they do this week last week it was a leading rusher for the team they came out throwing the first 12 snaps of the game anxious to see how they can approach to Miami here I would think you have to be a little careful as you go out there just to see how your offensive line matches up before you decide hey we're gonna go out throw it every down well they're gonna run it here with Blount and Luke Garrett trying to back in for an extra yard and he's got seven on the first carry of the game and if you ask that's the thing they wanted to run the football straight at this Miami defense they have had trouble stopping the run their 30th in the league at 32 football teams two tight ends in here for the Patriots Phil Gronkowski joined by Michael Williams now they've moved Palmer over to the left side Martin's hand and inactive they got Cameron and Miami tries to stack up the run but falling forward for the first down this LeGarrette Blount yeah good pushin inside you know you talked about this offensive line look at number 62 Center does a good job getting his blog David Andrews and we can't say it enough a rookie Center Trey Jackson a rookie right guard practice squad player at right tackle Cameron Fleming they played together last week a lot should have some carryover again only six offensive lineman dressed tonight and there's a completion over to Edelman and Taylor with the quick takedown Miami without Bryce McCain at corner tonight so Taylor steps up as a starter his gain of seven it Belichick working that offensive line and again with just a limited number of players tonight with cannon out with the toe injury chat Mason inactive with a knee and they moved Ballmer over to the left side you thought we might see some of Omer on the right side trying to match up against the likes of Cameron Way could sue over on that side over there keeping the continuity going from last week here's a second and three and from the gun run now ski split wide to the left from Amendola and the dolphins bring him down about two yards shy of the first we've got a flag on the field first of the night thrown by pete morales crew personal foul the illegal cracked back number 80 in the offense 15yard penalty remains second down snow the Amendola block did not wash with the officials and that'll back up the Patriots inside of the 25yard line there's Amendola he's on the ground and he hits Joannie giant Jenkins even though he's on the ground you could see makes an effort so that that's a good call he went low when he's down there still tried to make that block and it's wobbly through the flag it'll be a second and 18 coming up for New England Dion Lewis is up after sitting out the last game with injury and it's normally gonna be about a two yard take a third and 14 coming up and this is where if it in fact is gonna be a pass play coming up for Miami our first chance to see what these two guys do well a consume that's right and this is what the Miami Dolphins a little more conservative on the defensive side the last two weeks with the new defensive coordinator Luana Romo and this is what they want obvious passing situations where they don't have to worry about the run to go after Tom Brady Gronkowski to the near side third and 16 the first down he just raced by a number of dolphins without contact and picks up 17 before being brought down by Jones but we saw it on second and long Lewis coming down the back field acts like he's going to block her help on Olympia Vernon to block it comes out of the backfield that's what they want to do they do this a lot the Patriots when you watch them play Jim third and long they throw screens and that was a big play against this Miami defense early all the way up here the 43 and a new set of downs dragon to dolphins with him near midfield bring him down after six Tom Brady's never lost on a Thursday that's not all Thursday night games is a couple of Thanksgiving Day performances eight and oh 20 touchdowns two picks in Thursday performances well last week they threw it over 50 times didn't bother with the run because of the New York Jets defensive front we saw three tight ends and they ran behind it last time and picked up good young and he's near that first down yardage on the Miami side of the field and Dan Campbell he needed that defense to come out and make a statement after deferring to New England to start but that's another first down for the Patriots at the 47 of the Dolphins so you know you talk about the Patriots to know they're always going to look for what they perceive to be the weakness of the team they're playing against and that's what they attack and if you talk about Miami's defense it's the run defense is what you want to go after Blount already but four carries for 22 yards here's playaction of granite Aston Villa has gone Kowski slips out of the tackle cows key to the endzone for the touchdown 47 yards Grunk got away from her shot Jones and takes it the distance well Miami loves the matchup Rashad Jones done against Rob Gronkowski but they love this we get so you run the football you're just going to see Gronkowski go right down the middle watch everybody near the line of scrimmage and really it's not man to man coverage so but just a good make Rashad Jones mr. tackled that's what you never people don't understand Rob Gronkowski's so big but so good in the open field once he catches the football Brady and Gronkowski pick up right where they left off Sunday afternoon in the fourth quarter against the Jets Brady four for four on that drive and kosowski the extra point that's four hundred thirty six consecutive makes on the p80 by castouts key and Gronkowski it's the Patriots and opening drive touchdown you gotta think the Campbell had faith that his defense to come out and maybe control things at the start weight line of scrimmage you don't it shows you even an even a wellthoughtout and what you think it's a great plan sometimes doesn't work and the screenplay on third long to Dion Lewis that was a big play that was the play of the drive it was thirty sixteen victim seventeen his house key to Damian Williams to go Tannehill only had one misfire last week and that came midway through the fourth quarter you had a perfect rating will see this dolphins offense for the first time in a moment NFL Thursday Night Football is sponsored by Wendy's Intel see what the next generation of PCs can do and by Nissan innovation that excites and they're getting busy over nearby and you Bedford Massachusetts getting your supply ready for the 2016 season partner there you go here comes Tannen a few old saw me beware of that they're working through the night first play for the pumpkins is a run play with Lamar Miller and Miller with a nice second effort there take it out for a gain of seven that perfect rating the Tannehill had against Houston was the first ever by a Miami quarterback with a minimum of 15 attempts in a game all those years Dan Marino didn't get one of those but when you watch this offense tonight it's going to be different he's not going to have that perfect rating because they're gonna play him tight then take away those short throws to the wide receivers and even running backs when they split there's a playaction and to Miller who has the first down shoved out by Hightower so Tannehill had this streak last week filly carried it over from the Tennessee win got a completion streak up to 25 second of the alltime NFL record and again his only incompletion maybe could have been gone by Dionne Sims at the fourth quarter but I have said it's the first time out of its third and one coming up third and one Miller is the running back and gets the car as they going to take it outside and never shown house people who got flag down holding number 80 offense tenyard healthy remain it's on the tight end Sims who had been injured earlier in the season his return has been a big part of these last couple of weeks but he's flagged this time here he is on the outside of this that's a good that's a good call you can see Rob ninka bitch he grabbed his jersey pulled it and we a to flag solely because two different officials saw it so it's a third and 11 hard to get outside on one place against the New England offense their specialty hits funnel everything inside and go in there if you want to have success they load up the right side for Tannehill some catch for the first down by Matthews how about this rishard Matthews comes in oneonone on the left side we get good protection you got to worry about tani he'll get now the pocket and running but we've seen these outside routes almost like double moves by the Miami wide receivers they've worked very well the last two weeks Miami has a player down the right tackle chauhan James their firstround pick a year ago out of Tennessee and now gets to his feet and he's going to hobble over to the sidelines you don't I think looks like he might be well doctor looks like he might be okay just the fact that he's finding a way to walk off the field but when you look at this Miami team and you play the Patriots we saw it last week with Ryan Fitzpatrick as a quarterback make a decision and be quick you can move around and find that second open guy by moving as a quarterback Jason Fox in at right tackle time for walk here for Miller and no gain on that carry never missed some moment of football action with the CBS sports app every play and score every game in every highlight right as they happen download the CBS sports app down CBS sports.com slash mobile 82 points these last two weeks 38 at Tennessee 44 at home and both work number 76 offense fiveyard penalty remains second down the 82 points scored as the most by a coach taking over a team in a to gain stretch in the middle of the season since Mike Harvick put up 83 points in two games for the Boston Patriots back in 1961 one of the great gentlemen of yesteryear in the game well coach Campbell had a week off they had to buy all week so that helped him get ready for those two games where they went out and played so well but also they got some of their key players completely healthy like Cameron Wake Deon Sims their best blocking Titan in on the offensive side let has helped them tremendously the second and 15 and here's the throw for the first down again it is Matthews with a second catch rishard Matthews has Benton up a nice fine for them this year has now 28 catches on the season he's got a 17 yard play and a first down that time him in preseason he wanted to be cut he didn't want to go to training camp let me go you're not gonna let me compete for a job he where's he going to be maybe make it as the fifth receiver and he played so well during training camp and everything well the big surprise is this team makes the tough pitches anywhere on the field once for Jarvis Landry here he hasn't touched the football for this point their leading receiver and at the left side and then tried to fake him out and run it and keep it but it certainly didn't catch them offguard wasa one for lying on a hill a lot of window dressing for receivers to the left watch up top they run this play Mike Pouncy leading away but Nica fits the fact that he got upfield made sure he couldn't get outside mates the quarterback making that little extra move too late defense is there to make the tackle trying to match what Brady and the Patriots did with their first series take it down the field for a touchdown second and 11 right into the arms of Ning kovitch again another third down coming up hit first by Allen branch month a on CBS CY Supergirl is TVs number one new show don't miss a new episode Monday at 8:00 7:00 central only CBS pass protection has been good so far I did have I wondered I knew the New England Patriots to come out here and play some tight mantoman coverage and the first couple throws by Tannehill these wide receivers are winning the battle outside he's got Landry in the backfield Miller split wide to the left now he shifts back in here comes now they're all over Tannehill who breaks the tackle but he's in trouble back at the 41 taken down by Chandler Jones he was chased around first though by Geno Grissom and it's a loss of six in Miami most parts well they love to do these type of plays we showed in the opening fake it one way go to the other but the New England Patriots they see it every day in practice that's what they studied for to stop all those short passes to the outside those type of screens very good job by the defense dolphins one of only four teams to change both the punter and placekicker coming into the season along with the Tampa and this is matt dar sending it down to about the 15 and he is knocked down right away at that point by Zach Baldwin 42yard punt 7nothing New England during that break JaJuan James the right tackle for the Dolphins was taken to the locker room but back with New England its second Drive of the game begins at the 15 with Dianna Lewis the running back Jordan Phillips has come in at defensive tackle for the Dawkins look at that wiggle with us out to the 34 gate of 19 April the fakeout Khoa me see now really they're gonna change up all night long to the right side you're gonna see a double team against the best pass rusher Cameron wake and how about Dion Lewis we saw him a few weeks ago down in Dallas did they miss him bigtime when he was out of the lineup last week almost impossible to tackle one on one when he's outside like that quick toss back to Lewis pass for a moment takes off straight ahead the way to the Dolphins 48 so from the 15 to the Miami 48 in to plays another 18 here ray screens two of them very successful they're very good Josh Klein 67 left guard gets out there pulls gets a good block and look at the center David Andrews down the field Chandler would tie it in formerly with the Buffalo Bills he's got nine more josh mcdaniels well they were worried about protecting tom brady night they were going to be a little careful we saw that with the screens early well think they got confidence the rut game of course is working second one Bukowski denied that time by Grimes all right let's get the report down on the sidelines Tracy yes Jim an update on dolphins right tackle JaJuan James we saw him go into the locker room for further evaluation on his big toe on the left foot he tried to stand on his tippy toes was unable to do it in a lot of pain he is questionable to return Jim right and if he does not return we saw Fox come in for him that was the first end completion of the game but not down by crimes for either either side he the quarterback 30 we're trying to push the pile he's inside of a yard and you got an interesting decision coming up here for Belichick he has I look at it looks like it's going to be short of one yard so I would be I would think Bill Belichick is going to go for it here in this situation especially the success they've had here early in the game just running the football that was really the first time they stopped the run that last carried by Blount is in the backfield here for for the state the first thing you're gonna look for and you can't give up in that situation is the quarterback sneak and how do you defend it you put two defensive linemen one on each side of the center and you make Tom Brady go outside or hand it off to a running back and don't give him that easy play guys the first down why is it we don't see the sneak executed by other quarterbacks around the league anywhere close to the success level the Brady you know as I watched it this past week look at the sinner look how for David Andrews got down the field Tom Brady gets low the offensive linemen get lower than the defensive linemen and they read the defense and they go where the big guy hasn't Cameron Wake is not out there for the last several plays they've got Derrick Shelby there's a good tackle behind the line with a flag coming in on the back end of a Jones comes up and hits Blount personal foul clipping number 67 offense 15yard penalty still first down it's called on Josh Klein who moves over to left guard tonight and he's become one of the more experienced guys they have out there on that offensive front of course the senior statesman is Sebastian Vollmer with the current configuration they have well you know couple weeks ago we were down in Dallas and what was Bill Belichick say and I said well you got so much depth on the offensive line in next Thursday just a reminder on NFL Network only we'll have the Battle of Ohio Cleveland and Cincinnati first at 25 and timeouts call by Brady NFL Thursday Night Football is sponsored by chickfila we didn't invent the chicken just the chicken sandwich and by Bud Light make the right call drink responsibly as you look at the Boston skyline off in the distance Gillette Stadium located in between the state capitals of Massachusetts and Rhode Island that equidistant from Boston Providence here's a Princeton 25 off the penalty back to Gronkowski and he's wrestled down that time by Jenkins has touched down by the way earlier in this quarter his 61st career touchdown catch in 61 career starts it's covered by Aikens that time that was a blitz by the Miami defense well picked up and you got to know this when Tom Brady's the only guy back there there's no running back or a tight in in the backfield it's gonna be a quick short pass so you want to play tight and know as a defensive lineman second at 18 second short game made his return last week off a PU P he's got couple here but it's gonna be third and long coming up for the Patriots Cameron wake who set out the early part of this series is back on the field for the Dolphins defense which needs to do something well he got third long again we'll see if they can get pressure the big thing is can you find a way to make Tom Grady hold a football so either good zone coverage where the first guy is not open are very tight mantoman and maybe make him look for the second receiver third and 16 and I always out of a pocket control along at the last moment would have been a tough catch drunk wanted a hold he doesn't get it couple things happen there Bashar Jones all over him and good movement once again by Tom Brady so that ends the first quarter when the Patriots up 7 nothing will return after these messages and you're watching Thursday Night Football heavy rain passed through overnight beautiful clear evening here booth economy time of the year in New England we start the second quarter Jim Nantz Phil Simms Tracy Wolfson and Mike Carey and all the crew here on Thursday Night Football we start the second quarter with a New England punt Ryan out Jarvis Landry is dropped back for the Dolphins fielded by Alan fair catch demanded and secured by Landry near the ten well Jim the big matchup we want to watch tonight when it's mantoman Rashad Jones is right here here's Gronkowski then watch the receivers go down the field Edelman going deep they're all covered well and a good job by Rashad Jones redirecting as Gronkowski turned up the field let's see there's Tom Brady we talked about the opening one of the keys how he's moved around more this year and gets outside the pocket and makes throws just like he didn't go to Cal speak only the second time Miami's had it in this game the fakin past Casa Bella patted down my tower was right there like the old page it's back when a hit my cradle Tedy Bruschi Willie McGinest who's going to be honored here tonight they are great there are they got big linebackers they read the quarterback throws over the middle they knock them down as Dante Hightower you looked at him and then Jamie Collins they have both been tremendous so far this year for this case that's deep in head I think Matthews was open anyway right chuckling John here is Landry's first touch other than that fair catch and he's not back for no gain hit first by Jamie Collins Tuesday on CBS a special pill makes him a crime solving genius and the FBI has made him their greatest asset it's an allnew hit drama limitless Tuesday only CBS so here we go Jim we talked in the opening the excitement the Dolphins that won the last two and what do I notice so far in the game that New England right now is just a stronger more physical football team on both sides of the ball that's what it looks like third and 10 ready for it and that's going to be a safety complete breakdown on communication Pouncy and the quarterback not on the same page that's the first safety for the Patriots in three years what did you see happen there well it looks like it's Ryan Tannehill because if you watch Billy Turner the right guard he taps the center Mike bouncy and then when he taps him Tannehill everybody moves in unison except the quarterback so now they have free kick and Evelyn was back deep it won't reach him I picked up by Chung and who's been advance it to the 45 well Jim let's look at what happens here watch the right guard Billy Turner here he is he's gonna tap the center his time and what's the offensive line they all move in unison the receivers take off and really fortunate not to give up a touchdown here when you make a mistake like that so the first quarter and a minute into the second not looking look at that reaction anything like the last eight quarters for the Dolphins as Blount powers ahead for a quick five well of course we know this is a different opponent than they've seen the last two weeks there's no question about that and to think about the Patriots what makes it so tough you know we talked about a little bit this in the opening is there gameplan team in other words they change their offense last week of us all pass we can see they want to run it here tonight and they do a lot of the same things on the defensive side that's Williams moving over to the left side that helped lead the way here for one Vernon and others are in on them for a loss of qu the one thing knew they had pretty good speed at linebacker so those outside sauces when you look at the defensive line you see Jelani Jenkins Shepard Khoa me see all run well they should be able to get out there and stop those type of plays but there's another obvious passing situation there getting oneonone pass walking can I take advantage of it here's the third and seven throw it in the direction of LaFell as firsttime Brady has been knocked down well you can see once again being smart knowing that it's given respect to who's over there coming after you the short route coverage was tight how important was that to three and out forced by the defense well the defense two times you know you need some positive reinforcement you're up here it's a different situation different environment and tried to rush the punter Allen pinned them back at the nine the last time he's got another beauty here Landry was going to try to do something with it but who else but Matthews Slater his specialty hit on him right away and again Miami will start a drive inside of its own ten you're questioning why Landry even filled with that Punk Phil well I can't anymore do it every single week why the kitchen to the 5yard line I don't know trying to get Miller going with a flag out there there's nothing open for Lamar Miller on the offense the penalty will be declined second down so Lamar Miller now four carries for 11 yards nothing like what he did last week against Houston and he only played in the first half had 175 on the ground and had another long touchdown reception of course this dolphin team set the alltime franchise record putting a 41 first half points last week it's a struggle just to pick up first downs so far in this one second and ten from the end zone pass it a bit caught that time by Matthews they'll pass protection was good but you know you talk about Tannehill and we watch him play he has struggled up here at New England and one of the reasons why because we know he's mobile he can run they just know how to keep him right where he catches the staff of where he goes to and just squeeze the pocket makes it tough to throw it down the field and not much success when he plays in the stadium because of doing this pass rush in containment he's lost all three starts at Gillette two and one at home got a third and Ted here comes the pressure and Matthews wanted a flag is not going to get it saying they were close talking about the dolphins to having a second safety against them in the quarter you have a lot of pressure just pushing the pocket Nica bitch goes underneath the right tackle that time Jason Fox good job by Ryan Tannehill just getting rid of the football quickly Rob ninka bitch how about debt special teams player finds away on the field all of a sudden he's a starter in been an unbelievable contributor for many years that will give you time saved are with a big group flies all the way to the 25 off the bounce with a 33 give him 9 on the return but give him 7 D on the punt night nothing Patriots NFL Thursday Night Football sponsored by LG v10 captured the inbetween moments Nike gear up at Nike calm and get out of here and by the 2016 Lexus LS and ulx Hamish meets purposeful congratulations to the coach of the week Joe Pappagallo of Malden high school just north of Boston his golden tornados getting ready to face Peabody Veterans Memorial tomorrow night good luck to both teams not been a first down so far in this quarter for either side as Rainey and finds Amendola for a gain of 11 want to throw it down the field give your wide receivers more time playaction fake keep extra blockers in there and Tom Brady took advantage of it and really got his feet underneath him and threw a strike to the outside Amendola coming off of backtoback big games over a hundred at Indianapolis and eight catches including a touchdown against the Jets Brady's now hits six different targets so far in this game Kentucky and Jones able to push him out after one but it is seen how to sue so far well it's what I see about every week when I watch him play a good double team by the Patriots Fleming how about that he just one on the outside one on the inside and there's nothing he can do rush up let's help out doubleteam him there so when you see all these double teams and Wyatt's worked the last couple weeks well you got Cameron Wake Olivier Vernon now is healthy on the other side you doubleteam and Dominic ensue defensive ends need to get to the quarterback second and nine able to the tackle and there's no flag off the hands of LaFell tapir was able to catch up and get there at the last moment lafele who had a hard time holding on to it against the Jets last Sunday had his hands on this for a moment look at Vernon almost get to Brady yep he slipped in there Tom Brady because he was moving didn't quite crush the football in other words it wasn't perfect that's why I was a little out of bounds what about the contact across the face guard before the ball got there didn't see it when I watched it live and I saw it live I did not think it was a penalty but when you watch the replay in its low what what did you say there Mike Mike Carey they got away with the lucky one there a bat break across the face mask was enough for passing apparent 3rd and 9 and they've sat Brady for the first time in his Catlett awake who had only one time through the first four weeks he wasn't healthy but only one tackle not even a sack he had six the last two weeks and now he's got a seventh boy a good job by Cameron Wake turning the corner and getting that sack that's what you want to see for him they're being very careful living eliminating his plays because he had a hamstring injury he's been healthy then they want to keep him that way weeks career game and his money defense people in here this will be their best starting position at the 27 they'd have their on the tackle the grant family has to like what they've seen so far on this game up nine nothing and Robert crafts gonna have a big ceremony at halftime as Steven Ross the owner of the dolphins Willie McGinnis is going to go into the Patriot Hall of Fame he was the first pick once mr. Kraft took over ownership here he's tripped up near the first down little spot it looks like right on the mark tonight on The Late Show Stephen Colbert don't miss Seth MacFarlane and tomorrow Stephen welcome scharping Rose it's all new only CBS that's good for a first down on the past play the Landry here they run it with Jonas gray the former Patriot how about a difference a year makes for Jonas gray you think about last November in a game at Indianapolis he had 201 yards rushing for the Patriots four touchdowns and now you know depending on how you look at it he's the second or third running back at Miami what happened to him up here in New England I think he was late for practice was it then there was a common the next guy up and you lose your job a second attend gray with a bad drop early tried to come out change the rhythm of their offense and go a little quicker and faster thinking hey let's get some first downs get some rhythm and get confidence in this offense but couple drops here so far tonight really uninspired not physical not doing really anything right on the offensive side so far this game could be much worse for the Dolphins and out night nothing their defense and has managed to after that opening drive by the Patriots buckle down here's a third and ten that is Tannehill by Chandler Jones who has the second sight the second sack of the night couple things it took a long time they keep him in the pocket Chandler Jones gets around the edge you look down the field nobody's open watch the coverage nobody's there that's why he was holding the football and then allowed Chandler Jones get in there and get the sack let's see if dark could do anything close to repeating what he did last time is a 70 yard punt that changed field position getting close it's another good tip back at the tent Edelman Melvin with an 11yard rut back 61 yard punt that time and there is a flag illegal block in the back that the 24 is the receiving team 10yard penalty first down and timeout Deshawn Melvin fall for that one so the Patriots will have their were starting position of evening when we come back that penalty backs up New England to the 10yard line and rainy steps back to the one before to Edelman for the flag ow and he's out to the 32 if the play stands it's good for 22 in elves new player downfield number 71 the offense fiveyard penalty remains first down the saying the right tackle Fleming gets down the field gets a block inside and yes he's down the field Fleming starting at right tackle is again cannon was out they would prefer to pad cannon if he was up playing on the left side Sebastian Vollmer after the University of Houston on the right side what happened to him there Jim he was trying to sell the playaction fake so much kept you for down to first is 15 from the end zone contact with brainy on the past Earl Mitchell was the one in on Brady Earl Mitchell inside very athletic number 90 gets around the edge gets off the block that time of David Andrews the sinner it starting to get a little more pressure on Brady they definitely are you know you always look at it I always think the offensive line is the game goes on gets the advantage because the defensive line tires out and you start seeing all the moves well the job of adaptive of the defensive line Luis Luis is ramped up on a good piece of tackling by Jones who comes up to make the play holds him to three his D line we talked about this is the maybe the most important matchup of the night wake already has a sack in this one but the last two games was six sue got his first two as a member of the Dolphins against Houston third and 12 and his leg who jumped or was he drawn off neutral something from number 91 he can five yard penalty wake exits to pounce then he gives the Patriots a little more room to operate on third down you know when you watch his stance from the outside he gets his head low he's up in the air and it looks like he's getting ready to run the hundred meters in the NFL just watch his stance oh yeah don't no question so it's a third and seven now from the 13 metalman comes out of the backfield two new us who lined them as a wideout they've got a first down picks up 12 now about 10 very nice job they've said it one thing that Dion Lewis can do he can run those type routes double moves go down the sideline run the slants of course we've always seen the screens then you if you plane off coverage which Aikens did that's a pretty easy throw and catch now Lewis coming up big in the passing game now that's four catches for 66 yards beat back and block and he picks up a couple you've seen it's going through the tape you see but change in Brady not only way he throws the football to put the way his footwork in the pocket well we talked about in the open moving around warm scene a couple times a day where he's broken the pocket you know Jim he's adapted that's what you got to do as a quarterback in the NFL now and the biggest thing is I saw it in preseason his change of his mechanics we're trying relentlessly here's a chance to throw a little too high for Edelman but there was again some heat coming on to the quarterback by Vernon then up burned it on the outside beats the best offensive lineman you would save right now Sebastian Ballmer don't forget he's a right tackle moved to left tackle to help this beatup office is lying huh mechanically what is he doing different with his throwing motion his motion is just he's standing taller it's more compact spins the ball harder keeps the velocity up and I think he's been as accurate with the football so far this year number 87 offense five yard penalty remains third down Gronkowski gives back five then he hands him many years Saturday the SEC on CBS the best game for the best conference a rivalry that takes on a life of its own Florida and Georgia meeting once again on neutral turf and it all begins with college football today this Saturday on CBS up here the Miami Dolphins defense you've got to be alert for what hitting picked as a defensive back look out for screens on 31 seconds Green was the answer to that one Lewis but he's in the block on third down Brady's hat is too high and Taylor on the coverage of Edelman and again the Miami defense steps up well that's hit the Miami defense is absolutely keeping this team in the game and what they've done they've hit Tom Brady enough and they been around him where it starts to unnerve you a little as a quarterback good job he moves out of the way of the Dominic ensued but you know he feels the pressure and that's why the throw was off target so they for now two hands without a bounce started about the 26 yard line what would just suggest here that Miami can do offensively here in the rest of the second quarter I don't know hit see when you watch it they're not doing anything well they're not running it with power I know one thing I would stop I would stop trying to go outside in the run game you know I thought we've talked about it almost every time we do a Patriots game if you want to lose your job on the painters defense let it run get outside you if you're a defensive end so you got to run it with power up the middle and they got to find a way and be more consistent with pass protection alone against the world one coverage outside Kenny Stills at the top it is picked off by Logan Ryan he actually ran the route for him I'm watching it and you can see longer but watch this he doesn't he sits underneath reads the brake then goes underneath to receive a while that's it really I guess that's the way the route is supposed to be as he makes the cut Matthew's he's gaining ground instead of going toward straight towards a side line where you don't give an angle to the defensive back to Canoga under you and make that interception the first play of the drive results in Ryan's third interception of the season as the most for the Patriots well he's looking there the whole way but you know what that doesn't really matter because the defensive back never watched him he was reading the wide receiver brainy from the 39 with pressure able to get it away and a catch for a yard or two by Blount hey just a reminder Thursday Night Football next week only on NFL Network and hope against next Thursday will go to the NFL Network exclusively the first place Bengals take on the Browns we'll see you next Thursday night looking forward to that game I'll tell you Tom Brady's holding the football look at this since either six and old start playing really well the coverage is Bill Brady hold it defensive lines been getting second and eight carry my blood for two more we're inside of five minutes to go in the half in so far Tannehill and the Dolphins have produced 39 total yards of offense they'll be well rested you know when this is over there's no doubt about this first half it's just it's not been sharp it's like I said getting overpowered only run 17 plays here's the third and six I have a decision to make here's before than a foot blunt coming up and you got to think no other way dental check operates will probably go for here just inches shy it appears yeah he's an aggressive coach in these decisions the fact he's been to six Super Bowls as a head coach can make you to let you be even more aggressive but right away when it looked like it was short I looked over there and you can see Josh McDaniels the offensive coordinator looking at that play sheet what's the first play you can stop Jim right here that the quarterback snake which has already worked one other time on fourth and short the Miami sideline but here and a quarterbacks think the coaches all were jumping up and down because they know they preached all week when they're going to do it and they still let it happen so they get the measurement to confirm that yeah they're inside of a foot here you know when he does he's quarterback sneaks Tom Brady you really never talked about it with them but it's not like oh he's gonna automatically just go behind the center read the defense it could go all the way out here the tackle and of course they always have the option to change it to a running play with the running back and that running back is Blount and that'd be a good guy to hand it to in a situation look how tight this formation is flag first it's against New England you got to think we'll see cast aus key false start offense fiveyard penalty still third down correction fourth down because now skis made his last six from outside a fifth day they bring it about over here the left side watch a mood they'll flinch we're different they packed it in they're so tight they were making you think quarterback sneak run up the middle miss Danski right here with this attempt Phil is going for the New England team record to tie it that is a 25 consecutive makes held by Adam Vinatieri will be a 52yard attempt to keep the streak going dis da skis kick will get a turnover and it is good from fifty to twenty five consecutive banks to now share the record with his predecessor we're back where the Patriots have a touchdown a safety and the field goal and watch Kozlowski's smartly play this kick from 52 out you know your golfing days you know a lot about this when you watch them looks I thought oh my gosh he missed it and the win you see the flags on top of the goalposts very close to being blocks right past the hand of Shelby well another good job really the defense doing its part the offense has got to find a way get some confidence by the way at least get a field goal here before the first half is over being returned and the Dolphins possession Church so far not a lot to talk about three total first downs and again 39 yards you know what's happened talked about it it's hard to go outside and run but what they've done they have big guys inside now Allen Branch they drafted in the first round Malcolm Brown and they are getting better every single week so the statistics against his defense running the football they lie we're ranked 19th in the NFL but they keep getting better every week Miller was about to accelerate it's only three we were talking about Tannehill struggles here he's not the only quarterback oh they can't do anything up Gillette three touchdowns now six interceptions and he's been on his back a number of times now again he's won two of the three matchups at home the best thing many good things this Patriots defense has done but they have not let him move away and also far in his game losing his quitting right away his Miller you just like that that quickly we can have a third and eight that was easily inside a firstround draft pick well you know when you look at this page which team they are deep on the defensive side outside pass rushers linebackers and for really good inside once topless need a first down to keep the ball out of Brady's hands for a twominute drill third and eight spritzing in whistle first both start number 63 offense fiveyard penalty remains that was Thomas and nothing's going right for the Dan Campbell crew here so far yep well just as well nobody was open till they get a second chance here New England's shown them some different stuff they're putting the linebackers inside that time yes this is got the tube in and 1/3 of 13 when we come out of it now JV coach Cowher Dion getting the lowdown on the Nuggets from Stewart Milstein chief researcher as they get ready for the Lex's halftime report third and 13 from Miami and it's incomplete first time the tight ends been targeted tonight broken up by Patrick Jung well I'd say it's about time they throw it to him a little out and up or trying to go up the sideline and when you look at this offense the two guys you want to stop Jarvis Landry and a lot of different formations and movement and then Jordan Cameron that is best to make a play on it but look how well defended that was by a pair of defenders Miami has even reached the 40yard line in this quarter for staff and this one I want the last couple piedar does have a lot of hang time off the ground with it as Edelman the net woman weaving through of dolphins and now Brady of the Patriots will have the twominute offense with two timeouts near midfield well it's been sloppy from the start with his offense drop pass not ready for the snap protection a little spotty again not a single play has been snapped for the Dolphins in New England territory now that defense which they've leaned on for this half to just stay in the game somehow and they get this series started with Jenkins behind the line at a loss of three for a really good job Tom Brady Josh McDaniels trying to get the drive started with the draw play they throw a lot of screens Miami being very aggressive in the last few screens especially to the outside that's why new lane we went to the draw the defense has come through bake for this football team here in the first half Jim as we approach a minute to go again the Patriots with two timeouts second at 13 a complete for the first down that reminds me back to the days when they won their first double Super Bowls they did more playaction fake throwing it over the middle to the tight end and wide receivers that was their number one pass play and it's worked pretty well here tonight and watch the tight end at the top of the screen they're gonna don't let their Street pass Louis Lewis is bit it's another big game this one for ten get Klein some credit for a nice block well he's an excellent pool or when you watch Josh Klein that time good job keeps Earl Mitchell inside lets Dion Lewis get to the outside and Lewis out of bounds with 42 seconds now 17 seven receiving yards for Lewis on the night tipped at the line by me see what the flag out defense offside number 91 lined up in the neutral fiveyard penalty remain this is second penalty on waik in the quarter and again the Lexus halftime report coming up with all the breakdown of the firsthalf action from JB Dion and the coach I think good power could relate to Dan Campbell if both were in the league that were stars in the league they came in with a real aggressive mentality brought a lot of energy to their teams when we see that a Campbell at least in two weeks first at five to give him a first and goal to go near the fiveyard line beautiful girl by Tom Brady he read the defense he sees the coverage hits up filled by Jamar Taylor and he throws that back shoulder throw that's when you know you throw on the football really well as a quarterback when you could throw it behind the receiver exactly where you needed to be the Pacey the pace or the football was perfect and LaFell made the catch first in golf from the SEC's put a touchdown with the flag is out pass interference over 87 it was a great right wrap my Edelman Gronkowski robbing cows cows down the field and Rashad Jones is in position he owns that that's where he was and some cows key goes right into him extends his arms that's a good call the ball is taken back to the 16 bursted goal from here with 29 seconds of the half yes to the end zone this defense is really made Louis just comes out of the backfield nobody's there to covering they haven't covered him out of the backfield all night well in there everybody else it's running down the field covering wide receivers that tight in and then you have a running back coming out of the backfield nobody assigned to him absolutely had to be a blown assignment looked like the safety was playing zone nobody was on the running back Dion Lewis six catches 93 yards and a touchdown in the receiving game Brady was four for four on that drive and it's now 19 nothing Tom Brady now with two touchdown passes on the night constantly finding Dion Lewis in the passing game but my giblets just watch as you seen who covers Dion Lewis coming out of the backfield and the answer is nobody so just a big mistake that's all they talked about all week the Miami Dolphins let's make sure we stay composed especially on the defensive side and not make mistakes it needs quick turnaround games which most games do here in New England 24 seconds Miami with three timeouts and Patriots at home over the last 52 games 48 and 438 and one versus the AFC and the six straight wins versus Miami the last time the Dolphins won here it was when the Dolphins unveiled the Wildcat right the one had any idea about at the time Ronnie Brown had that monster game and they won here back in a wait Tony Sparano the coach devising that pounds beans about ten well a little screen down the field everybody's blocking on the right side Jarvis Landry comes underneath but my to me I would be so careful in this situation you get the football the start of the second half until all screen plays like that to break the tackle get a long game and maybe you can take a shot or two from there where they've got no one in the backfield with Tannehill was 16 seconds get underneath and as Jonas gray they want to quickly use a timeout here and they do well they give francs the rookie kicker any chance they need to pick up about 20 yards as completion to Landry and fortunate to have one second left does a good job getting outside the pocket and what it does they're gonna go for the field goal to say at least you could throw the football into the endzone this is of course it is a little favorable wind this kid has a huge leg it would be close to alltime kind of record numbers here it's going to be at 63 you know it would be one shy of the record don't forget number 91 Jamie Collins sorry I missed him timeout call by the Patriots this is going to be an attempt that would tie the second longest field goal in the history of the league Matt Prater at 64 has the longest the rookie kicker Andrew Franks had of carmelbythesea California makes this he might be on the front page of the Carmel pinecone this week there had a chance no tried to kick it so hard he knew the distance was so long in that took it like well I think we know what that means most people golf but he just put that extra effort into it it just kicks it way off line yeah you thought there might be a chance we see of Jamie Collins coming up the middle and having a chance at the Honda then didn't even come close to blowing across these so last week 41 points by the Dolphins no points this week the third time in the history of the game someone put up 40 plus one week and didn't produce a point the next 19 nothing New England at the intermission

  "transcript": "&gt;&gt; ARIZONA IS THE GRAND CANYON STATE. BEAUTIFUL LOOK AT GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK. COUPLE OF HOURS' DRIVE NORTH OF THE GREATER PHOENIX AREA. JUST A SPECTACULAR SUNDAY AFTERNOON. AND NOW A LOOK AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX STADIUM, WHICH OPENED IN 2006 AND IS THE HOME OF THE ARIZONA CARDINALS. BILL BELICHICK WEARING HIS FAVORITE HOODIE. THAT NO. 2 PENCIL WILL GO INTO HIS EAR SHORTLY. STEVEN HAUSCHKA WILL BE KICKING OFF FOR THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS. AND NEW ENGLAND WILL START ON OFFENSE, AS BACK TO RECEIVE THE KICK IS DANNY AMENDOLA. THE GAME IS A TOSSUP. BOTH TEAMS ARE TERRIFIC. PETE CARROLL ALWAYS ENJOYING THE MOMENT. MARSHAWN LYNCH, WHAT KIND OF A DAY WILL HE HAVE? BUT HE'S GONNA START WITH SKITTLES. SO NOTHING ELSE IS NEW. &gt;&gt; [ CHUCKLES ] &gt;&gt; MIGHT AS WELL JUST BE A PRESEASON GAME IN AUGUST FOR HIM. RICHARD SHERMAN READY TO GO TO WORK. INJURED HIS ELBOW. EARL THOMAS, THE DISLOCATED SHOULDER, BUT BOTH WILL PLAY TODAY, AS HAUSCHKA GETS READY TO KICK OFF. SUPER BOWL XLIX UNDER WAY IN GLENDALE, ARIZONA. WE'LL START WITH A RUNBACK BY AMENDOLA FROM 5 YARDS DEEP. AND TO THE 18YARD LINE HE COMES, AND THAT'S WHERE NEW ENGLAND WILL SET UP SHOP. TOM BRADY. HE SAID TO US YESTERDAY, AFTER WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS, HE SAID, \"THERE WOULD NOT BE A GAME I WOULD WANT TO WIN MORE THAN THIS ONE.\" &gt;&gt; NO SHORTAGE OF RED MEAT IN FRONT OF TOM BRADY FOR THIS ONE, IS THERE? &gt;&gt; HE HAS SHANE VEREEN AS HIS RUNNING BACK. MEANWHILE, NOW YOU'VE GOT GRONKOWSKI FLANKED WAY OUT TO THE RIGHT, NEAR THE SIDELINE. SHERMAN ON HIM. BRADY STARTS FROM THE SHOTGUN. THAT'S EDELMAN IN SHORT MOTION. AND THE FIRST PLAY IS A PASS TO THE OUTSIDE. IT'S CAUGHT NEAR THE SIDELINE, BUT ONLY A MINIMAL GAIN NOW FOR GRONKOWSKI. BRUCE IRVIN MAKING THE TACKLE. SECOND AND LONG. BRADY, SIXTH SUPER BOWL START. HE'S THROWN 197 PASSES IN THOSE GAMES. 1,277 THROUGH THE AIR. ALL SUPER BOWL RECORDS. THREE WINS, TWO LOSSES. AND ONE OF THOSE LOSSES CAME HERE AFTER THE '07 SEASON, TO SPOIL THE PERFECT SEASON, AS THE NEW YORK GIANTS DID THEM IN. LeGARRETTE BLOUNT IS NOW IN THE BACKFIELD. SECOND DOWN AND 8. THIS IS AMENDOLA COMING IN MOTION. SHORT DROP. PASS CAUGHT ON THE OUTSIDE. BREAKING A TACKLE AND COMING UP ABOUT 2 YARDS SHY OF THE FIRST DOWN IS AMENDOLA, AS HE GETS AWAY FROM RICHARD SHERMAN. AND THAT WILL SET UP A THIRD DOWN AND 2 FOR THE PATRIOTS. &gt;&gt; WELL, CLEARLY ONE OF THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT RIGHT OFF THE BAT IS, HOW CAN YOU HANDLE THESE PASS RUSHERS? THAT'S ONE WAY. GET THEM ON THE GROUND WITH SOME QUICK THROWS. AND THEN IT'S RICHARD SHERMAN ON THE OUTSIDE. WE HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THAT ELBOW. WILL HE BE ABLE TO TACKLE? WILL HE BE ABLE TO JAM THE RECEIVERS THE WAY THAT HE TYPICALLY CAN? &gt;&gt; IN THAT GREEN BAY GAME, IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS PLAYING WITH AN INVISIBLE SLING. THIRD AND 2. BRADY. GOOD, CLEAN POCKET THROWS. AND THAT'LL BE THE GAME'S FIRST FIRST DOWN, AS VEREEN SHANE VEREEN MAKES THE CATCH, AND HE'S TACKLED THERE BY THE OUTSIDE LINEBACKER, K.J. WRIGHT. &gt;&gt; ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT WHEN YOU PLAY AGAINST THE PATRIOTS IF YOU CLEAR ZONES, YOU HAVE TO HANDLE THE LIKES OF JULIAN EDELMAN AND SHANE VEREEN WITH INSIDE LINEBACKERS. THEIR QUICKNESS VERY TOUGH TO DEAL WITH. &gt;&gt; NEW ENGLAND CAN BEAT YOU EITHER WAY. IN THE DIVISIONAL GAME AGAINST BALTIMORE, 53 PASSES, AND THEN 40 RUNS AGAINST INDIANAPOLIS. THIS IS BLOUNT. THE SEAHAWKS EXPECT THEM TO BE MORE BALANCED THE PATRIOTS TODAY. SO HERE IS BLOUNT. HE WAS A PATRIOT LAST YEAR. HE SCORED FOUR TOUCHDOWNS IN A PLAYOFF GAME AGAINST INDIANAPOLIS. THEN HE SIGNS WITH PITTSBURGH. DOESN'T LIKE HIS ROLE THERE BECAUSE Le'VEON BELL WAS CLEARLY THE NUMBERONE BACK. WALKS OFF THE FIELD BEFORE THE END OF A GAME IN NOVEMBER, AND THEN WINDS UP SIGNING, AFTER HE CLEARED WAIVERS, WITH NEW ENGLAND. SO HE RETURNS HOME, AND HE IS THEIR STUD RIGHT NOW BECAUSE JONAS GRAY, THEIR OTHER RUNNING BACK, IS INACTIVE TONIGHT. SECOND DOWN AND 8. AND HERE'S BLOUNT. AND BLOUNT GETS IT UP TO THE 35YARD LINE. WRIGHT MAKES THE DEFENSE. THE SEATTLE DEFENSE BECOMING LEGENDARY RIGHT NOW. THEIR RANKS THIS YEAR FEWEST POINTS ALLOWED, FEWEST YARDS ALLOWED, THIRD AGAINST THE RUSH, TOPS AGAINST THE PASS. AND THEY'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR THE LAST THREE SEASONS. THIRD AND 6. DAN QUINN, THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR, WHO IN THE NEXT 36 HOURS OR SO WILL BE ANNOUNCED AS THE HEAD COACH OF THE ATLANTA FALCONS. BUT FIRST THINGS FIRST FOR HIM HERE, AS NEW ENGLAND COMES UP SPREAD OUT. FIVE RECEIVERS. PLAY CLOCK IS DOWN TO :02. THIRD AND 6. BRADY ABLE TO SURVEY. THROWS LOW AND INCOMPLETE. SO THEY GOT ONE FIRST DOWN, AND NOW THEY'LL HAVE TO PUNT. BYRON MAXWELL COVERING VEREEN. AND SEATTLE WILL GET THE BALL. &gt;&gt; ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR THE PATRIOTS IN THIS GAME IS TO FORCE THESE DEFENSIVE ENDS TO RUN THE LOOP. GO ALL THE WAY AROUND TOM BRADY AND THEN TRY AND SECURE IT UP FRONT TO MAKE SURE THAT TOM BRADY CAN STEP UP. THAT TIME, A LITTLE ANTSY IN THE POCKET. GOT RID OF IT QUICKLY. MISSED THE THROW. &gt;&gt; RYAN ALLEN. THE LEFTFOOTED PUNTER. GOOD, HIGH, DEEP PUNT. FLAG IS DOWN AS IT'S TAKEN AT THE 15YARD LINE. JERON JOHNSON CAME IN AND MAY HAVE RUN INTO THE KICKER. IF HE RAN INTO THE KICKER, IF IT'S THE 5YARD VARIETY, IT'S STILL NOT GOING TO BE A FIRST DOWN. BILL VINOVICH WILL MAKE THE CALL. IF THAT'S A 5YARD PENALTY, IT WOULD BE FOURTH DOWN AND 1. ROUGHING THE KICKER IS A FIRST DOWN. BIG CALL HERE. &gt;&gt; I THINK HE GOT HIS PLANT FOOT. &gt;&gt; RUNNING INTO THE KICKER. KICKING TEAM, NUMBER 23. 5YARD PENALTY. STILL FOURTH DOWN. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, SO THAT'S THE GARDEN VARIETY, AS IT WERE, WHICH MEANS THAT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE WILL NOW BE THE 40YARD LINE. AND ANOTHER LOOK HERE. &gt;&gt; THE RULE IS, IF YOU HIT THE PLANT LEG THIS LEG THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE 15 YARDS. I DON'T SEE RUNNING INTO THE KICKER RIGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; FIRST DOWN. TIMEOUT. &gt;&gt; WELL, JERON JOHNSON, HE CAN SMILE RIGHT NOW, BUT HE GOT AWAY WITH ONE. HAD IT BEEN ROUGHING THE KICKER, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A 15YARD PENALTY AND A FIRST DOWN. HERE IT IS AGAIN, CRIS. &gt;&gt; SO THE NONKICKING LEG WHEN YOU HIT THAT LEG, THAT'S 15 YARDS AND AN AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. WITHOUT QUESTION. BILL VINOVICH'S CALL, AND HE MISSED IT. &gt;&gt; SO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOURTH AND 1. NEW ENGLAND DECLINES THE PENALTY. THEY'LL TAKE THE PLAY. THAT WAS A 49YARD PUNT. THE BALL IS AT THE 16YARD LINE. AND LYNCH CARRIES. \"BEAST MODE\" UP TO THE 20YARD LINE BEFORE HE'S TACKLED BY HALF OF THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS. RUSSELL WILSON. WHEN HE FACES SUPER BOWLWINNING QUARTERBACKS HIS CAREER NOW THREE YEARS OLD HE'S 100, INCLUDING A WIN AGAINST TOM BRADY WHEN THESE TWO TEAMS LAST MET IN SEATTLE, EARLY IN THE SEASON IN 2012. SEATTLE WON THE GAME, COMING FROM BEHIND, AND WILSON SAID, \"THAT REALLY GOT US GOING.\" HE HAD A GOOD YEAR IN '12. OF COURSE THEY WON THE SUPER BOWL LAST YEAR, AND THIS YEAR NFC CHAMPS AGAIN. SECOND AND 7. STACK THREE RECEIVERS TO THE LEFT. WILSON HAD TO REACH DOWN FOR THE SNAP. AND THAT'S MARSHAWN LYNCH PICKING UP A COUPLE. ABOUT 2 YARDS SHY OF THE FIRST. THIRD DOWN AND SHORT. &gt;&gt; ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN IS SOMETIMES WHEN MAX UNGER, THE CENTER, IS MOVING TO HIS LEFT, THE SNAPS GO TO THE RIGHT. THEY HAD AN ISSUE WITH THAT IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME, AND HERE WE GO WITH THE EARLY SNAP WITH THE SAME ISSUE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S OF PARTICULAR IMPORT THEY'RE TRYING TO RUN THE READ OPTION. CAN THROW ALL THE TIMING OFF. &gt;&gt; NO DOUBT. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 2. THEY GO FOUR WIDE HERE. AND LYNCH IS GOING TO GET STACKED UP AND STOPPED. SO AFTER SEATTLE GETS THAT BREAK AND GETS THE BALL AFTER WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ROUGHING, IT'S A THREEANDOUT AND THEY'LL GET THE BALL BACK. &gt;&gt; BIG VINCE WILFORK RIGHT HERE. YOU NEED YOUR SUPERSTARS TO PLAY HUGE IN THE SUPER BOWL. THERE YOU GO. HE STANDS HIM UP. IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S BENCHPRESSING JUSTIN BRITT OFF OF HIM. HE MAKES CONTACT THOSE HUGE ARMS, HE EXTENDS THEM OUT, GAINS CONTROL, AND MAKES A BIG PLAY. &gt;&gt; JON RYAN TO PUNT. IT WAS RYAN WHO WAS HOLDING ON A FAKE FIELD GOAL THAT TURNED INTO A TOUCHDOWN WHEN THEY WERE DOWN 160 TO GREEN BAY. THAT WAS A HUMONGOUS PLAY IN THAT GAME. NOSE DOWN WITH A LOT OF BACKSPIN. FAIRLY SHORT KICK. FAIR CATCH CALLED FOR AND MADE BY EDELMAN. BILL BELICHICK, NO. 2 PENCIL AT THE READY. AT LEAST HE'S NOT WEARING THE FLIPFLOPS THAT HE WORE ALL WEEK LONG. HE'S GOT HIS SNEAKERS ON TODAY. &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] FORMAL WEAR. &gt;&gt; QUITE A SCENE AT MEDIA DAY. BRADY TO WORK. STARTS FROM THE GUN. FROM THE 32. PRESSURE PUT ON. VEREEN, WITH SOME HELP OUT IN FRONT. TAKES IT OUT TO THE 35YARD LINE. THAT'S A SHORT GAIN. KEEP AN EYE, CRIS, OBVIOUSLY ON KAM CHANCELLOR, WHO GOT BANGED UP IN PRACTICE THE OTHER DAY. HURT HIS KNEE AND WEARING A BRACE. &gt;&gt; AND HE'S NOT A SPEED PLAYER ANYWAY. HE'S ESSENTIALLY, AS BILL BELICHICK CALLS HIM, A LINEBACKER, HE'S SO CLOSE TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. BUT HE IS THE HAMMER ON THE BACK END, THE GUY THAT DELIVERS THOSE BIG HITS. AND YOU JUST HAVE TO WONDER NOW, IF HE DOES GET IN MANCOVERAGE SITUATIONS, WILL HE BE THE SAME? &gt;&gt; CHANCELLOR PLAYS DOWN LOW. EARL THOMAS PLAYS DEEP. THEY'VE GOT DEVELIN IN AT FULLBACK. THE FAKE TO BLOUNT, AND BRADY FLIPS IT TO THE SIDE FOR A FIRST DOWN. JULIAN EDELMAN TAKEN OUT THERE BY BYRON MAXWELL. &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF GAME THAT THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS AND TOM BRADY WANTS TO PLAY HERE. YOU HAVE TO GET THE BALL OUT OF YOUR HANDS QUICKLY WHENEVER YOU PLAY AGAINST SEATTLE. AS A MATTER OF FACT, SEATTLE IN PRACTICE THIS WEEK, AT 2.3 SECONDS, THE COACHES BLEW THE WHISTLE. THEY SAID, \"YOU WILL NOT HAVE ANY MORE TIME THAN THAT TO GET TO TOM BRADY.\" &gt;&gt; 8:12 LEFT IN THE OPENING QUARTER. PATRIOTS LINE UP CAMERON FLEMING AT TACKLE AS ELIGIBLE. THEY DID THAT 28 TIMES IN THE AFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. AND A NICE LITTLE HOLE HERE EXPLOITED BY BLOUNT, TAKING IT ACROSS THE 50 TO THE 49YARD LINE. AND THAT WILL MAKE IT SECOND DOWN AND 5 FOR THE PATS. &gt;&gt; RYAN WENDELL, ONE OF THEIR BEST RUN BLOCKERS, IS GONNA LEAD THE WAY ON THE POWER PLAY HERE. AND THIS IS WHAT THE PATRIOTS ARE HOPING TO DO. THE BUZZ WORD FOR THEM THIS WEEK WAS \"CONTROL.\" \"WE HAVE TO CONTROL THE GAME.\" THEY'RE HOPING FOR 30, 35 RUNS IN THIS GAME WITH LeGARRETTE BLOUNT. &gt;&gt; AND BLOUNT IN AGAIN. NOW YOU'VE GOT DEVELIN AS THE FULLBACK. HE SCORED A TOUCHDOWN IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. BLOUNT SAYS SOMETHING TO DEVELIN AT THE END, AS THE SNAP FROM BRADY TO BLOUNT. AND HE GETS GANGTACKLED AS HE REACHES THE 48YARD LINE. IT'LL BE THIRD DOWN AND 3. TONY McDANIEL RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE FOR THE TACKLE. JOSH McDANIELS IS THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR. HE HAD BEEN IN NEW ENGLAND. REMEMBER, WENT TO DENVER, THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT. WENT TO ST. LOUIS FOR A LITTLE WHILE. NOW BACK AS THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR. WE THOUGHT HE WOULD BE MUCH IN DEMAND WITH THE COACHING VACANCIES, AND HE WAS, BUT HE HAS CHOSEN TO STAY IN NEW ENGLAND, AT LEAST FOR ANOTHER YEAR. THIRD AND 3. BRADY, A QUICK TOSS. INSIDE SLANT. CAN GRONKOWSKI GET THE FIRST DOWN? HE CAN. CHANCELLOR IS THERE TO MAKE THE TACKLE. NEEDED 3, GOT 4. FIRST DOWN, NEW ENGLAND. &gt;&gt; JULIAN EDELMAN ON THE INSIDE, JUST GONNA RUN OUT HERE. AND THERE IS A COLLISION AND A FIRST DOWN. TOM BRADY NEVER EVEN GOT A CHANCE TO FIND THE LACES ON THAT ONE. HE DIDN'T CARE. HE FOUND THE BIG GUY, NUMBER 87. ONE OF THE THINGS WE KNEW WAS GOING TO HAPPEN IS THAT THEY WERE GOING TO CHALLENGE NATE SOLDER WITH THAT SPIN MOVE INSIDE. TWO YEARS AGO, 2012, THEY PLAYED, CHRIS CLEMONS HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS AGAINST NATE SOLDER WITH THAT MOVE. &gt;&gt; EDELMAN IN MOTION TO THE OUTSIDE. BRADY IDENTIFYING THE \"MIKE,\" OR MIDDLE LINEBACKER. BRADY FLIPS IT AGAIN TO THE OUTSIDE. VEREEN. SHANE VEREEN TO THE 40. BOY, IT'S BEEN A MERRYGOROUND AT RUNNING BACK FOR THE PATRIOTS THIS YEAR. THEY STARTED WITH STEVAN RIDLEY. HE GOT HURT. THEN VEREEN. THEN JONAS GRAY CAME ON AND WAS SPECTACULAR FOR A WHILE. MISSED A MEETING, AND THEN THEY BENCHED HIM AND PUT IN BLOUNT. &gt;&gt; THERE GOES VEREEN OUT. BUT WATCH AFTER HE CATCHES THIS BALL, HOW EVERYBODY COMES DOWN THREE GUYS RIGHT THERE TO MAKE THE TACKLE. ONE OF THE BIG POINTS OF EMPHASIS IN THIS GAME IS NO YARDS AFTER THE CATCH. IF THEY CAN TACKLE LIKE THAT ALL DAY, THEY'LL BE FINE HERE. &gt;&gt; GRONKOWSKI SETS UP ON THE RIGHT SIDE FOR LEVERAGE. AND BLOUNT FIGHTING HIS WAY, TRYING TO PICK UP THOSE EXTRA 2 YARDS TO GET THE FIRST. HE'S ABOUT A HALF YARD SHY, AS HE TAKES IT INSIDE THE 35YARD LINE. IT WILL BE THIRD AND 1. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE QUESTION IN THIS GAME WHICH OF THESE BIG BACKS COULD CONTROL THE GAME? MARSHAWN LYNCH, LeGARRETTE BLOUNT? THE PATRIOTS SAY, \"WE'RE A LONGDRIVE TEAM. WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO STRING THESE TOGETHER LIKE THIS.\" AND SO FAR IN THIS ONE, THEY ARE. &gt;&gt; OFTTIMES BRADY LIKES TO SNEAK, BUT NORMALLY IT'S WHEN THEY GET TO THE LINE EARLIER THAN THIS. THIRD AND 1. HANDS IT TO BLOUNT. SWINGS TO THE OUTSIDE. TURNS THE CORNER. PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN. LeGARRETTE BLOUNT TAKES IT TO THE 25YARD LINE. EARL THOMAS WITH THAT DISLOCATED SHOULDER HE TOLD US HE COULDN'T HAVE PLAYED IF THIS GAME HAD BEEN LAST WEEK MAKES THE STOP. &gt;&gt; BOUNCE OUT ALL THE WAY. THEY'RE GOING TO COME WITH THE FULLBACK, DEVELIN, HERE, WHO'S GONNA GET THAT OUTSIDE EDGE. IT LOOKED LIKE AN INSIDE RUN, BUT THE WHOLE WAY THAT WAS INTENDED TO GO OUT ON THE EDGE. AND THERE WAS BYRON MAXWELL, JUMPED INSIDE, AND PICKED UP A BIG FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; PATRIOTS, FOUR FIRST DOWNS IN THE GAME. SEATTLE, NONE. THEY HAD A THREEANDOUT. SIMPLE PLAY THROUGH THE MIDDLE. NOT MUCH THERE. TAKING IT TO THE 24YARD LINE THROUGH THE MIDDLE IS BLOUNT. IN POSTSEASON PLAY, THE SEATTLE DEFENSE, WHICH IS SPECTACULAR, BUT IN THE REGULAR SEASON, AS YOU CAN SEE, THIRD IN THE LEAGUE, BUT IN THE TWO POSTSEASON GAMES, AND THOSE WOULD BE THE GAMES AGAINST CAROLINA AND AGAINST GREEN BAY, AND EDDIE LACY HAD A BIG FIRST THREE QUARTERS 133 1/2. SECOND DOWN AND 8. FROM THE 24. THE FAKE TO BLOUNT. THE PASS TO AMENDOLA. AND HE HAS A FIRST DOWN. DANNY AMENDOLA MAKES HIS SECOND CATCH. &gt;&gt; SO FAR THEY'RE COMPLETELY NEUTRALIZING THE RUSH OF SEATTLE. HERE WE GO. JUST RIGHT OUT IN THE FLAT. LOOKED LIKE BRADY GAVE A LITTLE LOOK INSIDE. JEREMY LANE BIT ON THAT. AND SO FAR, THIS DRIVE COULD NOT BE GOING ANY BETTER FOR JOSH McDANIELS, THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR. EXACTLY WHAT HE HOPED FOR BE ABLE TO POUND IT, QUICK PASSES. &gt;&gt; BRADY HAS MISSED ONLY ONE PASS 8 OF HIS FIRST 9. THE BALL IS AT THE 14. TOM AGAIN PROTECTED WELL. THROWS TO THE OUTSIDE, TO THE 10YARD LINE. THAT WILL BE ABOUT A 4YARD GAIN AS HOOMANAWANUI MAKES THE CATCH. IN THE RED ZONE, THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS, THEY'VE BEEN INSIDE THE 20YARD LINE ON 10 OCCASIONS, HAVE SCORED 9 TOUCHDOWNS. AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BRADY, CRIS LOOK, MOST QUARTERBACKS, OBVIOUSLY, WOULD BE BETTER IN A CLEAN POCKET, BUT TOM, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM IN A CLEAN POCKET AND GETTING CONTACTED IS ENORMOUS. &gt;&gt; YEAH, IT'S EASY TO HAVE A CLEAN POCKET WHEN YOU'RE THROWING IT AFTER ABOUT A SECOND AND A HALF. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. PART OF THE GAME PLAN. SECOND AND 6. AND STUFFED IN THE BACKFIELD. LeGARRETTE BLOUNT. THAT'S MICHAEL BENNETT, NUMBER 72, A GUY WHO, IN WHAT IS PRETTY MUCH A STANDARD TYPE OF DEFENSE THAT LETS THE GUYS JUST DO THEIR JOBS, HE'S THE ONE GUY WHO MOVES AROUND ON THE LINE. &gt;&gt; RIGHT THERE. WILL PLAY ALL FIVE DEFENSIVE LINE POSITIONS. AND IT'S HIS QUICKNESS THAT IS THE BIGGEST CONCERN FOR BILL BELICHICK AND THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS. HE IS A GUY THAT THEY ARE GOING TO TRY AND DOUBLETEAM AND HIT ON A SECONDARY SHOT FROM THE CENTER OR SOMEBODY ELSE BECAUSE HIS QUICKNESS CREATES REAL PROBLEMS. &gt;&gt; THEY'VE HAD THE BALL 7 1/2 MINUTES. HALF THE QUARTER. THIRD AND 6. BRADY DANCING. AND IT IS PICKED AT THE 5YARD LINE. JEREMY LANE! STILL ON THE RUN. TRIPPED UP. PETE CARROLL RIGHT THERE TO SALUTE HIM. SO THE DRIVE ENDS ON A THIRD AND 6 AS LANE PICKS IT OFF. AND HE'S DOWN. THEY'VE WRAPPED UP HIS LEFT ARM. THAT'S THE FIRST INTERCEPTION, REGULAR SEASON OR POSTSEASON, IN HIS THREE YEARS, BUT HE PAYS THE PRICE, AS HE GETS CARTED BACK TO THE LOCKER ROOM. BRADY UNDER SOME PRESSURE THAT TIME. THAT WAS A 13PLAY, 58YARD DRIVE. IT TOOK 7:41. ENDS WITH A PICK. &gt;&gt; HARD TO BELIEVE THAT TOM BRADY JUST MADE THAT MISTAKE. UNDER PRESSURE, YES, BUT REALLY JUST THREW THAT ONE UP. &gt;&gt; NEW ENGLAND'S RUN 19 PLAYS, SEATTLE'S RUN 3. ALL OF THEM RUNS BY LYNCH. THIS TIME IT IS WILSON LOOKING DOWNFIELD. TAKES CARE OF NINKOVICH WITH A GOOD FAKE. AND THERE HE GOES. SLIDING TO A STOP AT THE 21YARD LINE. AND THAT'S WHERE RUSSELL WILSON CAN REALLY KILL YOU, NOT ONLY WITH HIS ARM, BUT WITH HIS LEGS. AND BACK WE GO TO THE INTERCEPTION. &gt;&gt; HERE COMES BENNETT. SCHOFIELD'S GONNA GO DOWN INSIDE. WATCH HOW LONG BENNETT WAITS. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. HERE HE COMES. AND NOW ATTACKS TOM BRADY. AS SOON AS BRADY SEES HIM, HE BASICALLY TRIED TO JUST LEAN BACK A LITTLE BIT, AND THREW IT RIGHT INTO THE ARMS OF JEREMY LANE. HUGE MISTAKE. &gt;&gt; SECOND DOWN AND 3. WILSON YET TO THROW A PASS. HERE'S LYNCH. AND LOOK AT LYNCH. SO TYPICAL OF LYNCH. TURNS HIS SHOULDERS. THEY CALL HIM A SPLITLEGGED RUNNER. YOU SEE HOW HE'S BUILT. POWERFUL. KNOCKS OVER PEOPLE. HAS HAD SOME OF THE GREATEST RUNS WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. FIRST DOWN HERE. &gt;&gt; YEAH, IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS, NO ONE HAS MORE RUSHING YARDS, 100YARD GAMES, OR RUSHING TOUCHDOWNS THAN THIS GUY. THEY CALL HIM BEAST MODE, AND YOU SEE WHY. THESE ARE LARGE HUMAN BEINGS, AND THEY SIMPLY CANNOT GET HIM ON THE GROUND. YOU SEE IT GAME AFTER GAME THAT WE DO. &gt;&gt; NOW WILSON. WITH FIVE RECEIVERS. JUST A THREEMAN RUSH FROM NEW ENGLAND. AND A SPY ON WILSON. HAS TIME. CAN'T GET ANY PRESSURE ON HIM. THERE HE GOES. AGAIN. LOOKING FOR THE FIRST DOWN, BUT COMING UP TO MAKE THE TACKLE IS DARRELLE REVIS. AND THAT IS A VERY FAST FIRST QUARTER THAT HAS JUST COME TO AN END. BACK TO GLENDALE. AL MICHAELS, CRIS COLLINSWORTH, MICHELE TAFOYA. THERE ARE YOUR NUMBERS THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER. NEW ENGLAND HAD THAT LONG DRIVE, AND THAT WAS ENDED WHEN LANE PICKED OFF THE PASS. THAT'S THE ONE TURNOVER. YOU KNOW, WE TALKED TO PETE CARROLL YESTERDAY BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT THAT, LET'S GO TO MICHELE FOR AN INJURY UPDATE. &gt;&gt; YOU MENTIONED JEREMY LANE. IT WAS A COSTLY INTERCEPTION, AL. HE IS DOUBTFUL WITH A LEFTWRIST INJURY. HE HAS GONE BACK FOR XRAYS. YOU SAW HIM CARTED BACK TO THE LOCKER ROOM. BUT THAT MAY BE THE ONLY PLAY HE MAKES TONIGHT, AL. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, MICHELE. HIT BY JULIAN EDELMAN AT THE END OF THE PLAY. SECOND DOWN AND 12. HERE'S LYNCH. YOU KNOW, CRIS, WE TALKED TO PETE CARROLL YESTERDAY. I SAID, \"YOU THINK THIS STARTS LIKE THE HAGLERHEARNS FIGHT WHERE THE GUYS COME OUT AND JUST TRY TO KILL EACH OTHER AT THE OUTSET, OR IS THIS MORE LIKE YOU'RE PARRYING, YOU'RE TRYING TO FEEL YOUR WAY THROUGH?\" THAT'S THE WAY IT'S STARTED. &gt;&gt; YEAH, THESE TWO GREAT COACHES, THEY WANT TO SEE WHAT THE OTHER ONE IS GOING TO DO. AND WE'VE SEEN IT IN SUPER BOWLS BEFORE. SOMEHOW BILL BELICHICK HAS A WAY OF PLAYING IT A LITTLE BIT CLOSE TO THE VEST. BUT THAT'S A HUGE MISS RIGHT THERE. WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING AGAINST A DEFENSE LIKE THAT, YOU CAN'T TURN IT OVER WHEN POINTS ARE SITTING THERE FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 9, WITH FIVE RECEIVERS OUT THERE. WILSON IS UNDER SOME PRESSURE. BUT THERE HE IS ESCAPING AND SURVEYING. NOW HE'LL GO BACK THE OTHER WAY. HE GETS A NICE BLOCK. AND THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE. DOWNFIELD, INTENDED FOR BRYAN WALTERS. SO NOBODY COULD GET OPEN. PRESSURE WAS PUT ON. FOURTH AND 9. &gt;&gt; WELL, HERE'S THE KEY THE PATRIOTS ARE GOING ALL MANTOMAN COVERAGE. LOOK, ACROSS THE BOARD. THERE'S REVIS RIGHT THERE ON DOUG BALDWIN. THAT'S GOING TO BE HIS MATCH THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE DAY. THE RECEIVERS ARE SCRAMBLING AROUND, TRYING TO MAKE A PLAY. THERE JUST WAS ABSOLUTELY NOBODY OPEN ANYWHERE. AND FOR RUSSELL WILSON, HE REALLY NEEDS TO FIND A LITTLE RHYTHM THROWING THE BALL, BUT SO FAR THIS COVERAGE TOO MUCH. &gt;&gt; 0 FOR 1 IS WILSON. THE OTHER PLAY WAS A SACK. REVIS GOT CREDIT FOR A SACK ON THE PLAY THAT ENDED THE FIRST QUARTER. NOW THE KICK HERE BY JON RYAN. JULIAN EDELMAN. SHORT KICK. FIELDS AT THE 34. DOES A LITTLE DANCING TO THE OUTSIDE. TACKLED, AFTER A RUNBACK OF 2, BY BROCK COYLE. LATE AFTERNOON HERE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX STADIUM. DARRELL BEVELL GOING OVER THINGS WITH RUSSELL WILSON. AND BRADY STARTS THIS DRIVE FROM THE 35YARD LINE. BLOUNT IS THE BACK. AN ERRANT SNAP, BUT HE COLLECTS IT AND THEN HITS AMENDOLA, WHO'S NOW CAUGHT THREE. AND THAT'S A FIRST DOWN BEFORE EARL THOMAS RUNS HIM INTO THE PATRIOT BENCH. &gt;&gt; WELL, WE'VE SEEN MICHAEL BENNETT HAVE AN EARLY IMPACT ON THIS GAME FROM SEVERAL DIFFERENT PLACES. DAN CONNOLLY UNABLE TO GET HIS HANDS ON HIM. THEN IN THE RUN GAME, RYAN WENDELL, WHO CAN'T BLOCK HIM. AND THEN THE STUNT, WHERE HE'S GOING TO COME ALL THE WAY AROUND. AND THIS PRESSURE LEADS TO THE BIG INTERCEPTION. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS A GAIN OF 17 ON THE LAST PLAY. GOOD PLAY FAKE, GOOD PLAY ACTION, BUT GOOD COVERAGE ON THE OTHER SIDE INCOMPLETE. THAROLD SIMON MAKES A NICE PLAY. BRANDON LaFELL, THE INTENDED RECEIVER. AND SIMON IS IN FOR LANE, WHO IS MOST LIKELY DONE FOR THE DAY, SO THERE IS YOUR NEW NICKEL. AND, BOY, THAT LEGION OF BOOM RIGHT NOW LANE, WHO IS KIND OF A SUPPORTING ACTOR, IS OUT. YOU'VE GOT THE ELBOW FOR SHERMAN. YOU GOT CHANCELLOR'S KNEE. AND YOU HAVE THOMAS' SHOULDER. &gt;&gt; AND SIMON'S GOT A BRACE THERE. IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR, AL. YOU JUST HAVE TO STRAP IT ON AND GO PLAY. &gt;&gt; VEREEN IS THE BACK IN THIS SET. THERE GOES EDELMAN OUT OF THE SLOT. BRADY, QUICK FLIP OVER THE MIDDLE. CAUGHT. THAT'S BRANDON LaFELL. HAD A NICE YEAR. CAME OVER FROM CAROLINA. PLAYED FOUR YEARS THERE, WAS AN UNRESTRICTED FREE AGENT. THAT WILL MAKE IT THIRD DOWN AND 3. &gt;&gt; HERE'S THE CHANGEUP RIGHT HERE. NOW YOU SEE WHAT'S CALLED A BULL RUSH. THEY SET HIM UP WITH THE SPIN MOVE INSIDE, NATE SOLDER. THEY'VE BEEN OUTSIDE. AND THAT TIME, THEY TRY TO GO RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE. SO FAR, NATE SOLDER'S HOLDING UP WELL. &gt;&gt; SOLDER, THE ONLY FIRSTROUND DRAFT CHOICE STARTING FOR THE PATRIOT OFFENSE. THIRD AND 3. BRADY OUT OF THE POCKET. AND HE CONNECTS HERE. THAT WILL BE A FIRST DOWN. VEREEN TO THE OUTSIDE. AND BOBBY WAGNER SAID, \"UGH!\" CLAPPING HIS HANDS. SHOULD HAVE STOPPED HIM, COULDN'T FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING, AL. THEY ARE JUST BASICALLY YOU KNOW, IN BASKETBALL, YOU CLEAR A ZONE, YOU LET A MICHAEL JORDAN OR SOMEBODY GO ONEONONE? IT'S THE SAME SORT OF THING THAT'S HAPPENING HERE. SHANE VEREEN, THEY'RE CLEARING OUT A ZONE, LETTING HIM GET INTO A ZONE WITH ONE OF THOSE LINEBACKERS, AND JUST TRY AND MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS, GET HIM THE BALL AND ALLOW HIM TO BREAK A TACKLE AND PICK UP A FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; SURGICAL. SHERMAN ON THE OUTSIDE, LINED UP AT THE BOTTOM AGAINST LaFELL. BRADY, GOOD PLAY FAKE, GOOD TIME. DEEPEST PASS OF THE DAY FOR HIM. AND IT'S INCOMPLETE. GRONKOWSKI WITH SOME CONTACT AT THE END OF THE PLAY, BUT THERE IS NO FLAG. IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN AND 10. &gt;&gt; THAT'S A GOOD SIGN FOR SEAHAWK FANS BECAUSE HERE'S KAM CHANCELLOR'S FIRST SHOT RUNNING DOWN THE FIELD AGAINST GRONKOWSKI. ALMOST CAME BACK UNDERNEATH AND MADE THE PLAY. BUT SO MANY TIMES WE SEE THIS NEW ENGLAND OFFENSE REALLY GET A JUMP START WHEN GRONKOWSKI STARTS TO GET INTO THE GAME, AND SO FAR, NOT A FACTOR. &gt;&gt; IN ALL OF BRADY'S SUPER BOWLS THREE WINS, TWO LOSSES ON PASSES THAT HE'S THROWN MORE THAN 20 YARDS FROM THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, HE'S 1 FOR 22. SO HE'S BEEN GREAT ON THE SHORT STUFF. HERE HE HANDS THE BALL OFF ON SECOND DOWN. IT GOES TO SHANE VEREEN. TO THE 35YARD LINE. GAIN OF 1. IT'LL BE THIRD DOWN. &gt;&gt; WELL, SOME OF THE QUICKNESS NOW STARTING TO SHOW UP. AND FOR PETE CARROLL, HE HAS TO BE SO PROUD OF HIS DEFENSE. YOU THINK OF WHAT THEY DID IN THAT CHAMPIONSHIP GAME AGAINST GREEN BAY, SURVIVING ALL THOSE TURNOVERS. AND HERE COMES BENNETT AGAIN, INSIDE, FLYING THROUGH THERE. EVEN WHEN THEY'RE ON THE BACK SIDE, YOU HAVE TO BE READY FOR THAT QUICKNESS. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 9. THIS WILL BE THE 26th PLAY RUN BY NEW ENGLAND. SEATTLE HAS RUN 8. BRADY PROTECTED AGAIN. THROWS CAUGHT ON THE RUN BY EDELMAN. HE'LL TAKE THE BALL TO ABOUT THE 10YARD LINE. JULIAN EDELMAN GETS FREE OVER THE MIDDLE. ON A THIRDAND9 PLAY, THAT'S 23 YARDS. &gt;&gt; SO THE INJURY SHOWING UP ALREADY HERE NOW. JEREMY LANE WOULD BE IN THAT POSITION. NOW IT'S THAROLD SIMON. AND JULIAN EDELMAN TOO QUICK. SO YOU WONDERED WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD ATTACK DOWN THE FIELD AGAINST THE RICHARD SHERMANS. CLEARLY, THEY HAVE NOT TRIED TO DO ANY OF THAT. BUT THESE INSIDE ROUTES, THE QUICKNESS OF THOSE TWO GUYS SHANE VEREEN, JULIAN EDELMAN NOW SHOWING UP. &gt;&gt; SO THE SECOND DEEP SURGE BY NEW ENGLAND. THE FIRST ENDED WITH THE INTERCEPTION. AND THIS IS BLOUNT GOING NOWHERE. GAIN OF 1 TO THE 11YARD LINE. IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN AND 9. &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT OUR FIRST LITTLE TACKLEELIGIBLE PLAY HERE. OF COURSE, THAT WAS A BIG PART OF THE CONVERSATION EARLIER. SO YOU GET CAMERON FLEMING IN THERE. HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ELIGIBLE. THAT ONE'S JUST SORT OF A BLUFF. WILL THEY COME BACK AND HAVE SOME SORT OF A PLAY WHERE HE'S ELIGIBLE, RECEIVER'S INELIGIBLE? WE'VE SEEN THEM ALL FROM JOSH McDANIELS. &gt;&gt; YES, WE HAVE. FLEMING OVER TWO DOZEN TIMES REPORTING AS ELIGIBLE AGAINST INDIANAPOLIS. SECOND AND 9. BRADY THROWS CAUGHT! LaFELL, TOUCHDOWN! BRANDON LaFELL, FROM CAROLINA TO NEW ENGLAND AS A FREE AGENT, MAKES THE CATCH, AND NEW ENGLAND STRIKES FIRST. &gt;&gt; GOING RIGHT AFTER THAROLD SIMON. YOU KNEW IT WAS GONNA HAPPEN. HARD SLANT INSIDE, AND THEN WATCH THE TAIL END OF THIS PLAY. IT IS EARL THOMAS THAT COMES OVER, AND SIMON ENDS UP HOLDING HIS ARM OR SHOULDER AFTER TAKING THE BRUNT OF THAT HIT. THEY DON'T HAVE MANY CORNERS LEFT TO PLAY, SO THEY NEED ALL THESE GUYS TO STAY HEALTHY. &gt;&gt; GOSTKOWSKI FOR THE EXTRA POINT. SO BRADY PUTS SIMON IN THE CROSSHAIRS. IT'S THE GRAND CANYON STATE. ONE OF THE YOUNGER STATES, OBVIOUSLY. THE 48th STATE. ONLY HAWAII AND ALASKA HAVE BEEN IN THE UNION A SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME. RUSSELL WILSON READY TO COME BACK OUT. NINE FIRST DOWNS FOR NEW ENGLAND, ONE FOR SEATTLE. TOTAL PLAYS, 288. GOSTKOWSKI TO KICK OFF. AND DOUG BALDWIN WILL MOVE TO HIS RIGHT AND JUST LET IT FLOP OUT OF THE END ZONE. 9:47 LEFT IN THE HALF. WILSON READY TO TAKE OVER. RAISED THE LOMBARDI TROPHY LAST YEAR AND TOLD US WHEN HE PUT IT DOWN, ALL HE COULD THINK ABOUT WAS DOING IT AGAIN NEXT YEAR. WELL, HERE IS NEXT YEAR, AND HE'S GOING TO GET SACKED AGAIN FOR THE SECOND TIME AT THE 18YARD LINE. CHANDLER JONES COMES IN TO TAKE HIM DOWN TO MAKE IT SECOND DOWN AND 12. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS HERE, BUT RUSSELL OKUNG IS GONNA PULL OUT, AND CHANDLER JONES IS GOING TO END UP ON THE GUARD, JAMES CARPENTER. MARSHAWN LYNCH, WHEN HE WAS COMING OUT FOR THE ROUTE, KIND OF KNOCKED CARPENTER OFF. SO, SO FAR HERE, RUSSELL WILSON HAS GOTTEN NOTHING GOING AT ALL. SORT OF LIKE THE BEGINNING OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME AGAINST GREEN BAY. 0 FOR 4 IN THAT ONE, FOUR INTERCEPTIONS UNTIL FOUR MINUTES TO GO IN THE GAME, A QUARTERBACK RATING OF 7. &gt;&gt; WILSON HASN'T COMPLETED A PASS. BRADY'S COMPLETED 14. TO THE 21YARD LINE GOES LYNCH. TACKLED THERE BY JAMIE COLLINS. SETTING UP A THIRD DOWN AND LONG. MAKE IT THIRD AND 8. &gt;&gt; ONE OF THE REALLY INTERESTING MOVES HERE, THEY'RE BRINGING JAMIE COLLINS HERE TO THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO BE ABLE TO GO SIDELINE TO SIDELINE WITH HIM. THE FEELING WAS THAT NOT ONLY COULD HE END UP SNIFFING OUT THE RUNS OF MARSHAWN LYNCH, BUT IF RUSSELL WILSON STARTS TO GET LOOSE ON THE EDGE, HE COULD RUN HIM DOWN, AS WELL. A VERY SIGNIFICANT PLAYER IN THIS GAME, JAMIE COLLINS. &gt;&gt; 8 1/2 LEFT IN THE HALF. THIRD AND 8. WILSON. GOING DEEP DOWN THE SIDELINE. AND BROKEN UP. LOGAN RYAN, THE NICKEL, KNOCKED IT AWAY FROM JERMAINE KEARSE. AND IT'S ANOTHER QUICK THREEANDOUT FOR THE SEAHAWKS. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GONNA ASK ME WHAT THE STORY LINE OF THIS GAME HAS BEEN SO FAR? I WILL TELL YOU THE UTTER DOMINATION IN MAN COVERAGE OF THE PATRIOTS' COVERAGE PEOPLE ALL OVER THE PLACE. THERE'S BEEN NOWHERE TO THROW THIS FOOTBALL. I'VE BEEN WATCHING IT ON ALMOST EVERY PLAY. THERE JUST IS NOTHING THERE. THEY'RE SPYING, THEY'RE TAKING CARE OF RUSSELL WILSON IN CASE HE WANTS TO RUN, AND THE COVERAGE PEOPLE DOWN THE FIELD ARE WINNING. &gt;&gt; GAME IS ALMOST 22 MINUTES OLD, AND WILSON HAS NOT COMPLETED A PASS. JON RYAN. GOOD, DEEP. BEAUTIFUL KICK. FIELDED AT THE 17 BY EDELMAN. RUNS INTO HIS OWN MAN. AND THEN RUNS OUT OF ROOM, AND HE'S TAKEN OUT OF BOUNDS AT ABOUT THE 27YARD LINE. IT'S THE OLD ADAGE, DEFENSE WINS SUPER BOWLS. THERE'S A LIST OF THE TEAMS THAT LED THE LEAGUE IN FEWEST POINTS AND YARDS ALLOWED. AND ONLY THE CHIEFS IN THE LAST SUPER BOWL BEFORE THE AFLNFL MERGER WOULD HAVE LOST, BUT THEY LOST TO THE NFL's NUMBERONE DEFENSE, AS THE VIKINGS WERE NUMBER ONE. THEY WERE THE TEAM THAT LOST TO THE KANSAS CITY CHIEFS BACK IN SUPER BOWL IV, AND THEN THE MERGER TOOK PLACE THE NEXT YEAR. &gt;&gt; DEFENSE CAN'T WIN ANYTHING, THOUGH, IF YOUR OFFENSE ISN'T DOING ANYTHING ON THEIR SIDE. 14022, THE TOTAL YARDS. &gt;&gt; CRAZY. &gt;&gt; GOODNESS GRACIOUS. &gt;&gt; THEY'VE GOT GRONKOWSKI OUTSIDE. LaFELL IS ON THE SLOT TO THE LEFT. WILL THEY START TO PICK ON SIMON AGAIN? EDELMAN NOW SETS UP ON THE LEFT SIDE. HE'S GOT THREE GUYS COMING OUT OF THE LEFT SIDE. LOOKS THAT WAY, AND HAS IT BATTED DOWN AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. IT'S TONY McDANIEL, 6'7\", 305, OUT OF TENNESSEE, BATTING IT. SECOND AND 10. &gt;&gt; YEAH, AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD STRATEGY BECAUSE NOW BRADY HAS GOT THEM SO FRUSTRATED WITH THESE QUICK THROWS, YOU'RE NOT SEEING THE PASS RUSHERS OF SEATTLE EVEN MAKING MOVES. THEY'RE BASICALLY HAVING TO JUST GO PUSH INTO THE OFFENSIVE LINEMEN AND THEN TRY TO GET THEIR HANDS UP BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY THEY'RE GONNA GET THERE. &gt;&gt; THREE RECEIVERS ARE SET ON THE LEFT SIDE AGAIN. BRADY. CHECKING THE MIDDLE. THROWS. CUTTING OVER THE MIDDLE IS JULIAN EDELMAN. THEY TACKLE HIM. IT'LL BE THIRD DOWN AND 3. BOBBY WAGNER, THE MIDDLE LINEBACKER WHO WAS SO INSTRUMENTAL IN THE SUCCESS OF THIS TEAM WHEN HE GOT HEALTHY, MAKES THE STOP. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, HERE'S BOBBY WAGNER RIGHT HERE. AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THEY'RE RUNNING SHANE VEREEN OUT OF THE BACKFIELD. THEN THEY'RE RUNNING THE TIGHT END OR SLOT ON THAT SIDE UP THE SEAM. SO ALL THEY'RE DOING IS CLEARING OUT AN ENTIRE ZONE AND LEAVING EDELMAN ONEONONE WITH BOBBY WAGNER, AND THEY ARE WINNING THE GAME WITH THAT STRATEGY. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 3. VEREEN. MOTION TO THE INSIDE. BRADY. ESCAPING. TURNS THE SHOULDERS, AND THE PASS IS DEFLECTED AND INCOMPLETE. SO IT'S FOURTH DOWN. &gt;&gt; LOOKED LIKE TOM BRADY WAS LOOKING DOWN THE FIELD, AND HIS RECEIVER GOT KNOCKED DOWN, SO HE BASICALLY JUST TRIED TO HOLD ON TO IT. HE SAW HIS RECEIVER ON THE GROUND. COULDN'T TELL WHO THAT WAS. MAYBE EDELMAN. EVERY RECEIVER'S ON THE GROUND. GRONKOWSKI AND EDELMAN KIND OF RAN INTO EACH OTHER. BRADY SAID, \"I BETTER NOT THROW THIS ONE.\" &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE FIRST THREEANDOUT. RYAN ALLEN TO PUNT. BRYAN WALTERS SET TO RUN IT BACK. AND IT BOUNCES AT THE 29YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; WHO'S HERE? WELL, JOHN TRAVOLTA. THERE HE IS. KEVIN HART. SITTING NEXT TO WILL FERRELL. A FEW JOKES IN THAT LUXURY SUITE. MARK WAHLBERG LOVES HIS NEW ENGLAND TEAMS. KENNY CHESNEY LOOKING ON. STEVEN TYLER IS ALSO A HUGE PATRIOT FAN. AND WE HAVE ROYALTY, AS WELL. FROM LIVERPOOL. PAUL McCARTNEY. NOW, FROM THE 30. THEY START THIS DRIVE, DO THE SEAHAWKS, WITH LYNCH. AND LYNCH WITH SOME TOUGH RUNNING. ALWAYS TOUGH RUNNING FROM MARSHAWN. UP TO THE 35YARD LINE. GAIN OF 5. MATT PATRICIA IS THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR. HE'S DONE A GREAT JOB. AND ONE OF THESE GUYS ONE OF THESE GUYS WHO MAYBE NEXT YEAR WILL BE IN LINE TO BE INTERVIEWED FOR A HEADCOACHING SPOT. &gt;&gt; SO MANY OF THESE RUNS OF MARSHAWN LYNCH, WHEN THEY START LEFT, THEY GO BACK RIGHT. AND THE PATRIOTS ARE KIND OF CRASHING IN FROM THAT SIDE AND TRYING TO TAKE AWAY THAT CUTBACK LANE, AND IT'S BEEN WORKING PRETTY WELL SO FAR. &gt;&gt; SEE WHAT HAPPENS HERE. THIS TIME, STRAIGHT AHEAD. BUT JUST BACKS HIS WAY FOR AN EXTRA YARD, YARD AND A HALF TO SET UP A THIRD DOWN AND SHORT. &gt;&gt; DONT'A HIGHTOWER, RIGHT HERE, THE BIG GUY IN THE MIDDLE. JUST GOING TO TRY TO COME IN THERE, AND THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO OCCUPY EVERY SINGLE LANE THAT THERE IS. JUST DON'T ALLOW THAT BIG GUY TO GET STARTED, BECAUSE WHEN HE STARTS WITH THOSE JUMP CUTS, HIGHTOWER, JAMIE COLLINS, NONE OF THEM ARE GONNA GET HIM. &gt;&gt; THIRD DOWN, A YARD AND A HALF. AND A WHISTLE HERE. WE'VE HAD A PENALTYFREE GAME. WE HAD ONE PENALTY, AND IT WAS DECLINED. BILL VINOVICH WILL FINALLY TAKE THE MIKE. &gt;&gt; FALSE START. OFFENSE, NUMBER 82. 5YARD PENALTY. STILL SECOND DOWN. &gt;&gt; SO A THIRD AND 1 BECOMES A THIRD AND 6. THAT'S LUKE WILLSON, 82, THE TIGHT END. THAT'S THE SECONDLONGEST INTO A GAME WITHOUT A COMPLETION. NEW ENGLAND IN SUPER BOWL XX, GOING ALL THE WAY BACK. THAT WAS AGAINST THE '85 BEARS. THEY GOT THEIR FIRST COMPLETION WITH FIVE MINUTES TO GO IN THE HALF. WE HAVE 5:44 HERE, BUT A THIRD DOWN AND 6 NOW. FROM THE 34YARD LINE. TO THE OUTSIDE. CAUGHT. CAN HE GET THE FIRST DOWN? WELL, WE'LL SEE WHERE THEY SPOT IT. THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE HIM A PRETTY GOOD SPOT HERE, AS BROWNER IS ABLE TO TACKLE KEARSE. AND THEY'RE GOING TO SPOT IT RIGHT AT THE 40, AND THAT WILL BE A FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; AND DESPERATELY NEEDED. HERE AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN, GOING AGAINST BRANDON BROWNER OF COURSE, FORMER MEMBER OF THE LEGION OF BOOM. DOES HE GET THAT THING TURNED OVER? I THINK HE DOES. PRETTY GOOD SPOT THERE. AND THAT WAS A BIG ONE. YOU GET THE PENALTY, YOU GET KNOCKED BACK FROM A THIRD AND 1, AND FINALLY RUSSELL WILSON STEPS UP AND MAKES A PLAY. &gt;&gt; SO KEARSE CATCHES WILSON'S FIRST COMPLETION. AND NOW LYNCH TO THE 45. YOU LOOK AT THESE SEATTLE RECEIVERS, CRIS, IT'S A FUNNY GROUP. THEY DON'T GET A LOT OF HEADLINES. NONE OF THEM WERE DRAFTED. NONE. REMEMBER LAST YEAR, THEY HAD GOLDEN TATE. HE WENT TO DETROIT. THEY HAD PERCY HARVIN. THEY THOUGHT HE WOULD BE A STAR THIS YEAR FOR THEM, AND THEN HE RAN HIS WAY OUT OF SEATTLE, AND THEY TRADED HIM TO THE NEW YORK JETS. PAUL RICHARDSON, A ROOKIE, GOT HURT. SO ALL FIVE OF THE GUYS WHO ARE RECEIVERS ARE FREE AGENTS. &gt;&gt; AND THEY GET UPSET WHEN ANYBODY SAYS NEGATIVE THINGS ABOUT THEM. BUT HERE'S THEIR MOMENT. THIS IS WHEN THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO WIN THE GAME. AND LUKE WILLSON NEEDS TO HELP, AS WELL. &gt;&gt; THE FAKE. WILSON, WHO HAS GOT A GREAT ARM. DOWNFIELD, TURNING AND MAKING THE CATCH! TWISTING AND TURNING IS CHRIS MATTHEWS. ANOTHER OF THOSE FREE AGENTS. A GUY WHO HAS PLAYED VERY LITTLE OFFENSE THIS YEAR, BUT THE GUY WHO RECOVERED THAT ONSIDE KICK THAT WAS SO HUGE IN THE NFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. &gt;&gt; AND HE'S A BIG GUY, AL. REMEMBER WATCHING IN PRACTICE THE OTHER DAY, HOW GREAT RUSSELL WILSON WAS AT THROWING THE DEEP BALL? FINALLY NOW HE GETS ONE COMPLETION, THEY TAKE A SHOT AND NOW THE SUBSTITUTION IS HAPPENING AND THE REFEREES ARE HOLDING UP PLAY SO THEY CAN'T GET THAT QUICK SNAP. &gt;&gt; THEY RACE TO THE LINE. HERE'S LYNCH. AND LYNCH TAKES THE BALL TO THE 7 AS THE CROWD CHANTS \"BEAST\" AT LEAST THE SEATTLE PORTION. ANOTHER LOOK AT THE CATCH BY CHRIS MATTHEWS, WHO DID NOT CATCH A PASS THIS SEASON. &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THAT. HOW ABOUT THAT ONE? ARRINGTON ALL OVER HIM, IN PERFECT COVERAGE. BUT THE ONE THING I LOVE WATCHING WITH RUSSELL WILSON NOT ONLY DOES HE THROW THE DEEP BALL WELL, BUT HE THROWS THEM HIGH. HE HAS ENOUGH STRENGTH IN HIS ARM TO GET IT UP HIGH SO A BIG, TALL RECEIVER LIKE MATTHEWS CAN GO UP AND GET IT. &gt;&gt; TUKUAFU IS NOW IN THE GAME AT FULLBACK TO PROVIDE LEVERAGE FOR LYNCH. HERE GOES LYNCH TO THE LEFT SIDE. HE GETS IT DOWN TO THE 2YARD LINE. CHANDLER JONES MAKES THE TACKLE. IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND A LONG YARD. &gt;&gt; I TELL YOU WHAT, CHANDLER JONES JUST TOOK THE HELMET RIGHT OFF OF JAMES CARPENTER ON THAT ONE. THERE IS SOME FIGHTS GOING ON INSIDE IN THIS FOOTBALL GAME. THIS IS JUST MAN ON MAN. HERE WE GO RIGHT HERE. I MEAN, THIS IS UP AND DOWN THE LINE. YOU CAN ALMOST PICK OUT ANY BATTLE YOU WANT TO SEE. HIGHTOWER, JAMIE COLLINS, CHANDLER JONES. IT'S LIKE THAT ALL THE WAY UP AND DOWN THIS LINE. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 2 FROM THE 3. WILSON. TO LYNCH. TOUCHDOWN! MARSHAWN LYNCH, WHO LED THE LEAGUE IN TOUCHDOWNS THIS SEASON WITH 17. 13 ON THE GROUND. IT'S ALL SET UP BY THE PASS TO MATTHEWS. AND WE'RE AN EXTRA POINT AWAY FROM A TIE GAME. &gt;&gt; ONCE YOU GET VINCE WILFORK CONTAINED THEY GET THE DOUBLETEAM ON HIM, AND THEN WE'VE SEEN IT SO MANY TIMES MARSHAWN LYNCH, YOU GIVE HIM A LITTLE SPACE. THEY HIT THE BIG PASS, AND NOW THE RUNNING GAME FINALLY OPENS UP. AND SEATTLE, AFTER DOING NOTHING, ANSWERS IN A BIG WAY. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT A LITTLE BRAWL. HELMETS FLYING OFF ON JUST ABOUT EVERY PLAY. &gt;&gt; WE GOT A SUPER BOWL GOING NOW. &gt;&gt; YEP. &gt;&gt; AND JUST LIKE GREEN BAY, YOU WONDER, DOES IT COME BACK TO HAUNT THEM IN SOME WAY, NOT BEING ABLE TO CONVERT EARLY IN THIS GAME? &gt;&gt; MMHMM. MEANWHILE, DONT'A HIGHTOWER GOT HURT, AND HE'S BEING ASSISTED OFF THE FIELD. THERE'S THE LINEBACKER, RIGHT THERE. BACK TO THE BENCH HE GOES. 2:16 LEFT IN A VERY, VERY FAST FIRST HALF. A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT WE'VE HAD ONLY ONE ACCEPTED PENALTY. AND ONE DECLINED PENALTY. &gt;&gt; WELL, IF YOU'RE A PATRIOTS FAN, DONT'A HIGHTOWER COULD NOT BE MORE SIGNIFICANT IN THIS FOOTBALL GAME BECAUSE OF MARSHAWN LYNCH. &gt;&gt; HIGHTOWER BATTLING A SHOULDER INJURY FOR MUCH OF THE SEASON. THAT WAS A 70YARD, 8PLAY DRIVE. SIX RUSHES, TWO PASSES. EXTRA POINT BY HAUSCHKA IS GOOD. LOOKING DOWN THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE ROOF, THE RETRACTABLE ROOF. THEY GROW THE GRASS OUTSIDE AND THEN WHEEL IT IN. THE GRASS IS GROWN IN ALABAMA. BUNCH OF TRUCKS BROUGHT IT IN. &gt;&gt; HOME OF? &gt;&gt; HERE YOU GO HOME OF KEN STABLER. FOLEY, ALABAMA. &gt;&gt; THERE YOU GO. &gt;&gt; DOWN BY THE GULF. SO, SO MUCH MADE ABOUT THE FOOTBALLS AND WHERE THEY'D BE AND UNDER LOCK AND KEY. AND THEY'VE BEEN WELL TAKEN CARE OF. THERE THEY ARE. ALL OF THEM 12.5 TO 13.5 POUNDS. CRIS, I WAS THINKING, YOU KNEW NEIL ARMSTRONG NOT SINCE ARMSTRONG STEPPED ON THE MOON HAVE MORE ASTROPHYSICISTS BEEN INTERVIEWED ON TELEVISION THAN THIS WEEK. &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; I THINK WE KNOW ALL WE EVER NEED TO KNOW ABOUT POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH. &gt;&gt; I TELL YOU, THAT WAS AN INTERESTING DAY WITH THE PATRIOTS THIS WEEK, THOUGH, WASN'T IT? &gt;&gt; OH, YEAH. &gt;&gt; I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE DIRECT WITH MY QUESTIONING OF BILL BELICHICK, TOM BRADY, ROBERT KRAFT. THEY ALL ABSOLUTELY DENIED ANY KNOWLEDGE, ANY INVOLVEMENT, ANY POSSIBILITY, ANYTHING THEY SAID COULD HAVE LED TO INTENTIONALLY DEFLATING THOSE BALLS. &gt;&gt; YOU SAW ROBERT AND JONATHAN KRAFT. INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING. BOB KRAFT PUT ALL OF HIS CHIPS ON THE TABLE WHEN HE SAID HE WANTED AN APOLOGY FROM THE LEAGUE WHEN THEY FOUND OUT THERE WAS NOTHING THERE. MEANWHILE, AMENDOLA, BEFORE HE STEPS OUT OF BOUNDS, PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN AT THE 31YARD LINE. SO IT ALL STARTED YOU ALL KNOW IT. I MEAN, UNLESS YOU WERE, I DON'T KNOW, SOMEPLACE, SOME OTHER PLANET, BUT THE DEFLATED FOOTBALLS WHICH THEY DISCOVERED AT HALFTIME IN THE INDIANAPOLIS GAME, AND ALL OF THE WACKINESS AND CRAZINESS THAT LED UP TO TONIGHT. QUARTERBACK COMPARISON. WEIRD NUMBERS. BRADY WITH A LOT OF SHORT STUFF. AND THEN THE ONE PASS TO LaFELL GOT THEM INTO THE END ZONE. AND THEN WILSON DID NOT COMPLETE A PASS UNTIL THAT LAST DRIVE. HAD THE 6YARDER TO KEARSE AND THEN THE 44YARDER TO MATTHEWS. JUST TWO COMPLETIONS, BUT THAT SET UP LYNCH TO GET INTO THE END ZONE. THUS AT THE 2MINUTE WARNING, WE ARE KNOTTED AT 7. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHEN THE PATRIOTS ARE AT THEIR BEST. THEY LED THE NFL WITH 66 POINTS IN THE FINAL 2 MINUTES OF THE FIRST HALF. LET'S SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO HERE. &gt;&gt; AND THEY HAVE ALL OF THEIR TIMEOUTS. STARTING THE DRIVE FROM THE 31YARD LINE. BEGIN ON THE GROUND. BLOUNT. AVOIDING TACKLERS. FIGHTING HIS WAY FOR A FIRST DOWN. GETS TO THE 41YARD LINE. SEE WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO MARK IT, THOUGH. THEY'RE GOING TO MARK IT A LITTLE BIT SHORT. INCHES SHORT. SECOND AND INCHES. &gt;&gt; THEY'VE BEEN STARTING A LOT OF THESE DRIVES WITH CAMERON FLEMING IN AT TIGHT END. THAT TIME THEY RAN RIGHT BEHIND HIM. GREAT DRIVE START. &gt;&gt; SECOND AND INCHES. BRADY FLIPS IT QUICKLY. THAT CONVERTS. VEREEN GETS TAKEN DOWN. BOBBY WAGNER, THE LINEBACKER, COVERING HIM ON THE OUTSIDE. FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING. THEY'VE BEEN TAKING VEREEN RIGHT OUT OF THE BACKFIELD AND THEN WORKING HIM WIDE AND CREATING SOME SPACE INSIDE, SO THAT TIME THEY FINALLY THROW IT TO HIM. &gt;&gt; TICKING DOWN TO A MINUTE. BRADY. GOOD PROTECTION. DEEP ON THE OUTSIDE. AND OVER THE HEAD AND INCOMPLETE OF DANNY AMENDOLA. BYRON MAXWELL COVERING. SECOND AND 10 FOR THE PATRIOTS. PATRIOTS, 66 POINTS IN THE FINAL 2 MINUTES OF THE FIRST HALF. &gt;&gt; AL, YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY GRONKOWSKI HASN'T BEEN MUCH OF A FACTOR WE'RE STARTING TO SEE SOME OF THESE LURK COVERAGES WHERE KAM CHANCELLOR NOW IS WALKING DOWN INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD WITH REALLY NO RESPONSIBILITY NUMBER 31. AND SO IF GRONKOWSKI COMES ON ONE OF THOSE CROSSING ROUTES, HE'S RIGHT THERE TO PICK IT UP. &gt;&gt; THE DEFENSE CROWDING THE LINE, AS SHERMAN'S GOING TO GO TO THE OUTSIDE, MIRRORING EDELMAN, WHO GETS IT, AND THEN HE'S JUST TRIPPED UP AFTER A SHORT GAIN. YOU HAD EDELMAN GOING ACROSS THE FORMATION AND SHERMAN FOLLOWING HIM. &gt;&gt; THE OLD JET SWEEP, RIGHT? YOU JUST TURN AROUND, AND IT'S RIGHT THERE. AND THEN BRUCE IRVIN, AS ATHLETIC AS HE IS, HE JUST CAN'T REACT TO IT THAT QUICKLY. NICE TO HAVE SOMEBODY LIKE A JULIAN EDELMAN ON YOUR TEAM THAT CAN DO SO MANY THINGS. OF COURSE, ONE OF THE BIG PLAYS OF THIS PLAYOFF RUN WAS HIS TOUCHDOWN PASS ON THAT DOUBLE PASS TO DANNY AMENDOLA. &gt;&gt; IN THE GAME AGAINST BALTIMORE, WHERE THEY ERASED TWO 14POINT DEFICITS. THIRD AND 3. OH! AND JUMPING ACROSS AND THEY WHISTLE IT DEAD BECAUSE HE COULD HAVE GONE UNABATED TO THE QUARTERBACK WAS CLIFF AVRIL. SO HE'S OFFSIDE. AND THAT IS A FREE FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; NEUTRALZONE INFRACTION, DEFENSE, NUMBER 56. 5YARD PENALTY. STILL THIRD DOWN. &gt;&gt; IT JUST DOESN'T GET WORSE THAN THAT. WHEN YOU'RE IN A THIRD AND LESS THAN 5, EVERYBODY ON THAT DEFENSIVE LINE SHOULD BE YELLING, \"DON'T JUMP, DON'T JUMP, DON'T JUMP!\" AND THEN IT'S THE VETERAN, CLIFF AVRIL, WHO WAS SO BIG, I THOUGHT, IN THE GAME AGAINST PEYTON MANNING LAST YEAR BUT REALLY HAS BEEN A NONFACTOR SO FAR HERE. &gt;&gt; SEAHAWKS WERE THE MOST PENALIZED TEAM IN THE LEAGUE THIS SEASON. AND THEIR OPPONENTS DREW FEWER PENALTIES. IT WAS LIKE A 2TO1 RATIO FOR THE SEAHAWKS THIS YEAR, THEIR PENALTIES AGAINST THE OPPOSITION. COSTLY ONE THERE. THE BALL AT THE 44. FIRST DOWN. BRADY. LOW THROW, BUT CAUGHT. OFF THE SHOE TOPS OF SHANE VEREEN, WHO GETS THE BALL TO THE 26YARD LINE. NEW ENGLAND WITH ALL OF ITS TIMEOUTS, AND THEY WILL ELECT TO USE THEIR FIRST RIGHT HERE. &gt;&gt; THERE WE GO, OUT OF THE BACKFIELD. AGAIN, CLEAR THE SPACE, CLEAR THE ZONE. ONEONONE ROUTE. JUST LET THEM GO TO WORK. THEY'RE DROPPING DOWN EARL THOMAS THAT TIME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD, BUT HE JUST COULDN'T QUITE GET THERE. YOU'RE GOING TO WIN THAT BATTLE AGAINST A LINEBACKER LIKE BOBBY WAGNER, BUT EARL THOMAS KIND OF GOT PICKED OFF AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THERE. &gt;&gt; COMING UP ON THE TOYOTA HALFTIME REPORT, THE GUYS WILL BREAK DOWN THE FIRST HALF, TELL YOU WHAT EACH TEAM NEEDS TO DO IN THE SECOND HALF. TWO COACHES WHO CERTAINLY KNOW HOW TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS. COMING UP ON THE TOYOTA HALFTIME. BILL BELICHICK. HE'S WON MORE POSTSEASON GAMES THAN ANY COACH IN HISTORY. 21. 20 OF THOSE WITH THE PATRIOTS. YOU FORGET HE WON ONE OF THOSE WITH THE CLEVELAND BROWNS. COACHED THERE FOR FIVE YEARS AND WENT TO NEW ENGLAND IN 2000. YOU GOT GRONKOWSKI MATCHED UP WITH SHERMAN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. AND THE PASS IS FLIPPED TO THE OUTSIDE FOR A SHORT GAIN. VEREEN GETS SHOVED OUT OF BOUNDS. AND IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS, IF THEY KEEP GOING TO THESE QUICK PLAYS, YOU HAVE THE OPTION, IF YOU'RE SEATTLE, TO MAYBE BRING IN SOME EXTRA CORNERS, BUT BECAUSE OF THE INJURY TO JEREMY LANE, REALLY, IT'S THAROLD SIMON THEY'RE ALL OUT THERE ON THE FIELD ALREADY. SO OPTIONS LIMITED. SO RIGHT NOW THE PATRIOTS SAYING, \"WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITH THIS SPREADOUT LOOK AND ALL THESE RECEIVERS BECAUSE WE LIKE THE DEFENSIVE BACKS ON THE FIELD RIGHT NOW THAT THEY HAVE.\" &gt;&gt; MEANWHILE, YOU HAVE SHERMAN YOU CAN SEE HIM. HE'S IN THE SLOT. AND BRADY'S GOING TO THROW DEEP DOWN THE RIGHT SIDE FOR GRONKOWSKI. AND A TOUCHDOWN! AND THE EARTHQUAKE SPIKE. SEE, YOU'VE GOT THE LINEBACKER COVERING HIM. AND GRONKOWSKI IS ABLE TO HAUL IT IN. K.J. WRIGHT COULDN'T HANG WITH HIM. 22 YARDS FOR THE SCORE. &gt;&gt; AL, IT'S AMAZING, IS THAT THE PATRIOTS KNEW COMING INTO THIS GAME THAT IF K.J. WRIGHT WALKED OUT, HE WAS GONNA BE ABOUT 8 YARDS OFF AND WAY INSIDE, AND THAT SIGNALED MAN COVERAGE. IT ALWAYS SIGNALS MAN COVERAGE WHEN THEY'RE IN THERE. THERE WAS NO DOUBT AT THE SNAP OF THE BALL WHERE THAT ONE WAS GOING. GRONKOWSKI AGAINST K.J. WRIGHT, A MISMATCH. CHANCELLOR, MAYBE. THAT ONE WON'T WORK. &gt;&gt; 1:45 THEY WENT 80 YARDS IN EIGHT PLAYS. GOSTKOWSKI FOR THE EXTRA POINT. WELL, THAT WOULD FIGURE. MOST CAREER T.D. PASSES IN A SUPER BOWL JOE MONTANA AND TOM BRADY EACH WITH 11. TWO TONIGHT FOR TOM. &gt;&gt; HAD THE ONE MISTAKE EARLY, AND SINCE THEN HAS BEEN RAZOR SHARP, HASN'T HE? &gt;&gt; MMHMM. 20 OF 27, 177. A LOT OF SHORT STUFF, BUT TWICE HE'S GONE LONG AND IT'S PAID OFF FOR HIM. LaFELL AND GRONKOWSKI. &gt;&gt; AMAZING THAT THE BIG INTERCEPTION BY JEREMY LANE COULD HAVE ACTUALLY TURNED THE GAME IN FAVOR OF THE PATRIOTS. HE GOES OUT, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE QUITE THE COVERAGE TEAM. &gt;&gt; GREAT POINT. LOSE A GUY LIKE THAT. TRY TO WORK AROUND IT. AND NOW THIS WILL BE OUT OF THE BACK OF THE END ZONE. SO WITH 31 SECONDS, THEY HAVE ALL OF THEIR TIMEOUTS NOT THAT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO GET THEM IN WITH 31 SECONDS, BUT LET'S SEE IF WILSON CAN GET THEM INTO FIELDGOAL RANGE. &gt;&gt; NATE SOLDER RIGHT THERE. HANDLED THE SPIN MOVE PRETTY MUCH. AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE, SEBASTIAN VOLLMER GOING AGAINST MICHAEL BENNETT. BUT THE BALL IS OUT OF THERE SO QUICKLY, HE KNEW PRESNAP ALL HE WAS GOING TO DO WAS LOOK OFF THE SAFETY. IT WAS SO EASY TO READ THE COVERAGE. AND THE ONE THING ABOUT THE SEAHAWKS IS, THEY DON'T CHANGE. THEY NEVER CHANGE. YOU KNOW WHICH COVERAGE THEY'RE IN, AND I DON'T THINK THEY CARE. &gt;&gt; ROBERT TURBIN NOW IN THE GAME. WILSON. HE'S GONNA GIVE IT TO TURBIN. AND TURBIN'S GONNA GET FREE AND TAKE IT OUT TO THE 39. IT'S A 19YARD GAIN. SEATTLE WILL TAKE A TIMEOUT HERE. MEANWHILE, BACK TO THE LAST DRIVE, CRIS, HOW BIG WAS THE JUMPING OFFSIDE OF CLIFF AVRIL? THAT WAS A THIRD DOWN AND 3 AT THAT POINT. &gt;&gt; YEAH, I MEAN, YOU DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE PICKED IT UP ANYWAY? POSSIBLY. BUT ONE THING YOU DO NOT WANT TO DO IS MAKE ANYTHING TOO EASY ON TOM BRADY. &gt;&gt; SO, TOM BRADY, 20 OF 27 AFTER THE WACKIEST TWO WEEKS OF HIS CAREER. 37. WE ALL KNOW THE STORY. DRAFTED IN THE SIXTH ROUND. HE WAS THE 199th PICK. GOT A CHANCE TO START IN 2001 WHEN DREW BLEDSOE GOT HURT IN A GAME AGAINST THE JETS. THAT WAS BELICHICK'S SECOND YEAR. AND THE REST IS HISTORY. AND HE'S WRITTEN MOST OF IT. 24 SECONDS. FROM THE 39 NOW. WILSON. GETTING AWAY. AND WILSON IS OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 45YARD LINE. SO NOW YOU HAVE 17 SECONDS. HAUSCHKA IS THEIR FIELDGOAL KICKER. GOOD RANGE, BUT HAUSCHKA DID MISS THREE FIELD GOALS IN THIS STADIUM AGAINST ARIZONA IN DECEMBER. &gt;&gt; JAMIE COLLINS, ONE OF THE MOST ATHLETIC DEFENDERS THE PATRIOTS HAVE, COULD NOT GET A HAND ON RUSSELL WILSON. AND THE SAD PART ABOUT IT IS, ALL THE PATRIOTS HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS WEEK, IN THE FINAL 2 MINUTES OF THE HALF OR THE GAME, OR IN BIG MOMENTS, BELIEVE ME, RUSSELL WILSON'S GONNA PULL THE BALL DOWN AND RUN WITH IT, AND THEY STILL LET HIM GET OUT. &gt;&gt; 17 SECONDS. THEY NEED ABOUT 10 YARDS OR SO AND EITHER A TIMEOUT OR OUT OF BOUNDS. WILSON. ROLLING AWAY. AND THEN HE HAS TO THROW IT AWAY. SO NOW YOU GET DOWN TO THE MATH. YOU GOT 11 SECONDS. YOU CAN STILL USE ALL OF THE FIELD BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE TIMEOUTS. HAUSCHKA'S HAD A GOOD YEAR, BUT HAUSCHKA, AS I SAID WE DID A SUNDAYNIGHT GAME HERE IN DECEMBER, AND HE MISSED THREE FIELD GOALS. &gt;&gt; AND ONLY MISSED SIX ALL YEAR. YOU JUST WONDER GOLF, RIGHT? THERE'S A FEW HOLES, YOU STAND THERE ON THE TEE, AND YOU GO, \"I'M NOT FEELING TOO GOOD ABOUT THIS ONE.\" WONDER IF IT HAPPENS TO FIELDGOAL KICKERS, TOO. &gt;&gt; HAPPENED RIGHT HERE TO TIGER WOODS ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY, DIDN'T IT? &gt;&gt; SURE DID. &gt;&gt; SECOND AND 10 NOW. WILSON. THROWING. AND THAT WILL BE CAUGHT. AND THAT WILL SET THEM UP FOR A FIELD GOAL. BUT A FLAG HERE. RICARDO LOCKETTE MAKES THE CATCH. BUT IT'S THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HAD A FLAG IN THE SECONDARY. IF IT'S HOLDING AGAINST THE DEFENSE, THEY'LL DECLINE THAT, PUT THEM INTO FIELDGOAL RANGE. 6 SECONDS. YOU HAD &gt;&gt; PERSONAL FOUL, FACE MASK. DEFENSE, NUMBER 25. THAT PENALTY WILL BE ADDED ONTO THE END OF THE RUN, HALF THE DISTANCE TO THE GOAL. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; SO THAT'S AT THE END OF THE RUN. IT GETS TACKED ON. SO, IF YOU'RE THE SEAHAWKS, DO YOU DARE? I MEAN, YOU HAVE 6 SECONDS. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN AFFORD IT. WHAT DO YOU THINK, PARTNER? TO GO FOR IT? &gt;&gt; I THINK YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET THESE 3 POINTS OUT OF HERE. BUT IT'S INTERESTING, AL, THAT YOU'VE GOT WE TALKED ABOUT THESE RECEIVERS. IT HAS BEEN BASICALLY THE BACKUPS, RICARDO LOCKETTE AND CHRIS MATTHEWS, WHO HAVE MADE THE PLAYS HERE IN THE FIRST HALF. &gt;&gt; SO THE FIELDGOAL UNIT CAME OUT. NOW THE OFFENSE COMES OUT. NOW THEY CALL A TIMEOUT. SO, I MEAN, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT TO RUN A PLAY IN 6 SECONDS? AND THEN YOU RUN THE RISK OF NOTHING LEFT ON THE CLOCK. AND YOU ARE GOING TO GET THE BALL SEATTLE WILL TO START THE SECOND HALF. &gt;&gt; WELL, AND I'LL TELL YOU THIS, AS WELL THE PATRIOTS AREN'T A BUNCH OF DUMMIES. SO YOU'RE OVER THERE WITH 6 SECONDS. THEY KNOW WHAT YOU GOT TO DO. YOU EITHER GOT TO THROW A SLANT YOU GOT TO THROW SOMETHING WHERE YOU CATCH IT AND THROW IT. SO NOW DO YOU WANT TO TAKE A CHANCE AGAINST BILL BELICHICK AND MATT PATRICIA'S DEFENSE, OF SORT OF TIPPING YOUR HAND AS TO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IN THIS SITUATION? THEY'RE GONNA TRY IT. &gt;&gt; VERY RISKY. VERY FASCINATING. &gt;&gt; OBVIOUSLY, YOU CAN'T TAKE A SACK. CAN'T SCRAMBLE AROUND. IT'S GOT TO BE A CATCH AND THROW, AND I'M GONNA GUESS RUSSELL WILSON'S BEEN TOLD, \"UNLESS IT IS PERFECT, THROW IT AWAY.\" &gt;&gt; THIS IS LIKE THE NBA CATCHANDSHOOT TIME. GET IT, AND GET RID OF IT. SO PETE CARROLL GOING AGAINST THE GRAIN, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. 6 SECONDS. THAT'S THE KEY HERE. WILSON. LINING UP IN THE SHOTGUN. AND NOW NEW ENGLAND IS GOING TO TAKE A TIMEOUT. &gt;&gt; SECOND CHARGED TIMEOUT, NEW ENGLAND. &gt;&gt; SO THEY TOOK A LOOK AT THAT SET. AND NOW WILSON WILL COME OVER AND DISCUSS THINGS WITH THE GUYS ON THE SIDELINE. LITTLE RECAP OF THE GAME. JEREMY LANE WITH THAT BIG INTERCEPTION TO STYMIE THE DRIVE, BUT THEN HE GOT HURT. CHRIS MATTHEWS, WHO DIDN'T CATCH A PASS ALL SEASON, A 44YARD RECEPTION, SETTING UP A LYNCH SCORE. THEN GRONKOWSKI BEATS K.J. WRIGHT, HAULS IT IN FROM BRADY. AND WE GET TO 147 IN THAT MANNER. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, IF YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE A SHOT HERE, YOU WOULD THINK MAYBE CHRIS MATTHEWS. HERE'S A GUY THAT'S 6'5\", 218 POUNDS, REDZONE THREAT. THROW IT UP, GIVE HIM A CHANCE GOING AGAINST ONE OF THESE SMALLER CORNERS. &gt;&gt; WE'LL SEE. YOU GOT LOCKETTE AND KEARSE GOING TO THE RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THERE'S MATTHEWS AT THE BOTTOM. &gt;&gt; MATTHEWS OUTSIDE. BALDWIN IN THE SLOT. HE'S GOT TO GET RID OF IT IN A HURRY. AND HE DOES. AND IT'S CAUGHT! TOUCHDOWN! CHRIS MATTHEWS. HOW CRAZY. ANOTHER ONE OF THE SEATTLE FREE AGENTS. YOU DON'T EVEN HEAR ABOUT HIM UNTIL HE RECOVERS THE ONSIDE KICK AGAINST GREEN BAY. TONIGHT, A 44YARD RECEPTION, AND HERE A TOUCHDOWN RECEPTION. WHAT A GUTSY CALL. &gt;&gt; YEAH, AND YOU GO, OKAY, CHRIS MATTHEWS IS THE FOURTH RECEIVER, AND LOGAN RYAN IS YOUR FOURTH CORNER. BUT THE SIZE DIFFERENTIAL ALONE AT THAT MOMENT SAID MAYBE CHRIS MATTHEWS SHOULD BE THE NUMBERONE GUY THAT WE COVER HERE. WHAT A GREAT CALL THERE BY PETE CARROLL. &gt;&gt; EXTRA POINT IS GOOD. SO INSTEAD OF IT BEING 1410, OR 147, EACH TEAM WITH A TOUCHDOWN IN THE FINAL 2:14. AND WE'RE KNOTTED AT 14. &gt;&gt; ALL RUSSELL WILSON HAD TIME TO DO WAS CATCH IT AND THROW IT. I'M NOT SO SURE THAT IF HE HAD TRIED TO THROW A FADE INTO THE BACK OF THE END ZONE THAT THE CLOCK WOULDN'T HAVE EXPIRED. INSTEAD, WHAT DO THEY DO? THEY THROW A BULLET, BACKSHOULDER PLAY, AS LOGAN RYAN BACKED INTO THE END ZONE. AND TOM BRADY, THE WRY SMILE. WELL, IT IS WHAT WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE. ONE OF THESE KIND OF GAMES. TWO GREAT COACHES, GUTSY CALLS. WOW. &gt;&gt; BOTH OF THESE TEAMS, THEY HAVE THEIR SUPERSTARS, BUT THEY JUST ADD THESE GUYS. THEY COME OUT OF NOWHERE. YOU DON'T HEAR VERY MUCH ABOUT THEM. NEW ENGLAND'S DONE THIS FOR YEARS, AND SEATTLE WITH PETE CARROLL AND THEIR GREAT G.M., JOHN SCHNEIDER, PEOPLE SAY, \"HOW CAN YOU DRAFT RUSSELL WILSON IN THE THIRD ROUND?\" WE KNOW HOW THAT TURNED OUT. PICKS UP GUYS LIKE CHRIS MATTHEWS. WHAT A DIFFERENCE IT MAKES. &gt;&gt; YEAH, AND THEY HAVE SPECIFIC ROLES, RIGHT? CHRIS MATTHEWS, ONE OF THOSE GUYS, A BIG RECEIVER. \"I BET YOU HE'D BE GOOD DOWN IN THE RED ZONE. LET'S SEE IF HE CAN MAKE A PLAY.\" LOOK WHAT HAPPENED. &gt;&gt; AND A BOUNCING BALL WILL BE FIELDED AT THE 31YARD LINE. AND THAT'S DEVELIN WHO TAKES A KNEE. AND THAT WILL TAKE US TO HALFTIME, WITH A LOT COMING UP AT THE HALF. SEATTLE'S GOING TO GET THE SECONDHALF KICKOFF. WHAT A DRIVE THERE. 80 YARDS, FIVE PLAYS. THEY RAN IT TWICE, THREW IT THREE TIMES. IT TOOK 29 SECONDS FOR THE SEAHAWKS. ANOTHER LOOK AT THE TOUCHDOWN HERE. &gt;&gt; JUST A BULLET THROW, BACK SHOULDER. KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED TO DO WITH IT GET IT UP HIGH TO THE 6'5\" CHRIS MATTHEWS. NO CHANCE FOR LOGAN RYAN. &gt;&gt; RIGHT, SO LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. &gt;&gt; THERE HE WAS. GREAT FIRST HALF, THOUGH. &gt;&gt; GOSTKOWSKI'S KICKOFF GOES THROUGH THE END ZONE. SEATTLE WILL TAKE OVER AT THE 20. AND WE GO TO MICHELE. &gt;&gt; I JUST SPOKE WITH PETE CARROLL, WHO SAID, AFTER THE INJURY TO JEREMY LANE, THEY WILL NOT MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IN THAT SECONDARY. HE'S HAPPY WITH THE PLAYERS THEY'VE GOT. HE JUST SAID, \"WE GOT TO GO BEAT THE...OUT OF SOME OTHER PLAYERS AND DO WHAT WE CAME HERE TO DO.\" AS FOR BILL BELICHICK, HE SAID, \"THIS GAME IS NO MYSTERY. IT'S A PLAYERS' GAME. WHICHEVER PLAYERS PLAY BEST IN THE SECOND HALF WILL BE CHAMPIONS, AND THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE.\" &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, MICHELE. GREAT CHESS MATCH. TWO GUYS WHO HAVE ONLY FACED EACH OTHER TWICE BEFORE. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THESE TWO GUYS FACED EACH OTHER IN 1994. BELICHICK, THE HEAD COACH OF CLEVELAND. PETE CARROLL IN HIS ONE YEAR WITH THE NEW YORK JETS. AND OFF WE GO IN THE SECOND HALF. STARTING WITH LYNCH. THEY'VE DONE A GOOD JOB BOTTLING HIM UP TONIGHT. HE GOES TO THE 23YARD LINE. HIS 13th CARRY BUT ONLY FOR 48 YARDS. THE BUZZ BRADY, HIS NUMBERS. 11 CAREER SUPER BOWL T.D. PASSES, INCLUDING TWO IN THE FIRST HALF. RUSSELL WILSON. TOOK HIM A LONG TIME TO GET STARTED. DIDN'T HAVE A COMPLETION UNTIL THERE WERE ABOUT 5 1/2 MINUTES LEFT IN THE HALF. THREW THAT T.D. PASS AT THE END. CHRIS MATTHEWS DIDN'T MAKE A SINGLE CATCH THIS YEAR OR IN HIS CAREER. FOURTH PLAYER TO MAKE HIS FIRST CATCH EVER IN THE SUPER BOWL. THIRD SUPER BOWL GAME OF THE 49 TIED AT THE HALF. LYNCH IN THE BACKFIELD. GIVE IT TO HIM. MARSHAWN LYNCH OFF AND RUNNING. HIS BIGGEST CARRY OF THE NIGHT. HIS BIGGEST GAIN. OUT TO THE 38YARD LINE FOR A FIRST DOWN. CARROLL HAPPY ABOUT THAT. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL. YOU'RE TRYING TO STEP UP HERE AND COME AROUND HERE, AND YOU JUST CREATE A LANE. IF YOU GET THE FIRST LINEBACKER BLOCKED, WHICH J.R. SWEEZY DOES, NOW YOU GET THAT BIG GUY IN THE SECONDARY, AND LOOK OUT. THE PATRIOTS KNEW THAT TO START THIS SECOND HALF, THE SEAHAWKS ARE A TEAM THAT WANT TO COME OUT AND POUND THE FOOTBALL. SO FAR THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING. &gt;&gt; AS THEY DID AGAINST GREEN BAY. NOW THEY RUN PLAYACTION. WILSON GOING DEEP. AND IT'S CAUGHT AGAIN! CHRIS MATTHEWS! CAN YOU BELIEVE WHAT'S GOING ON? THIS IS A GUY WORKING IN A FOOT LOCKER STORE WHEN THE SEAHAWKS CALLED HIM, SAID, \"COME ON AND TRY OUT.\" HE HAD TO TELL HIS BOSS, \"LET ME GET OUT OF WORK EARLY. I HAVE TO FLY UP TO SEATTLE.\" &gt;&gt; I'LL SAY ONE THING FOR CHRIS MATTHEWS HE KNOWS HOW TO SUBTLY WORK IT. A LITTLE NUDGE IN THE BACK RIGHT THERE AGAINST KYLE ARRINGTON, BUT ENOUGH FOR HIM JUST A LITTLE GOT ARRINGTON GOING FORWARD. AND HIS SIZE IS THE DIFFERENCE. LOOK AT THE HEIGHT THAT RUSSELL WILSON PUTS ON THAT BALL. PERFECT. WE SAW HIM MAKE SO MANY THROWS LIKE THAT IN PRACTICE. &gt;&gt; FROM THE 17. NOW IT'S LYNCH. TYPICAL LYNCH RIGHT HERE. MOVING THE PILE FORWARD. TAKING IT TO THE 10YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; AL, THIS IS WHAT I LOVE ABOUT SEATTLE'S OFFENSIVE LINE. THEY LOVE MARSHAWN LYNCH. AND AT THE END OF PLAYS, SO MANY TIMES YOU'LL SEE THE OFFENSIVE LINEMEN COME DOWN THE FIELD AND SORT OF GET ON HIS BACK AND START TO PUSH HIM, ALMOST LIKE A RUGBY SCRUM OF SOME KIND, AND JUST PUSH HIM RIGHT DOWN THE FIELD. BUT IF THAT GUY GETS GOING, EVERYTHING STARTS TO WORK THE READ OPTION, THE BOOTLEG GAME, ALL THAT STARTS TO WORK FOR THIS OFFENSE. &gt;&gt; LYNCH OUT, TURBIN IN. BALDWIN IN MOTION. FAKE IT TO HIM. GIVE IT TO TURBIN. AND HE'LL GET WRESTLED DOWN A YARD SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN. SPOT THE BALL AT THE 8YARD LINE. THIRD AND 1. &gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU WHO'S HAVING A REALLY NICE GAME SO FAR IS J.R. SWEEZY. WE HAVE SEEN HIM RIGHT ON SOME BIG BLOCKS. HE'S HAD TO TAKE ON VINCE WILFORK MOST OF THE NIGHT. A VERY SOLID RUN BLOCKER ALL SEASON LONG. AND THIS FORMER DEFENSIVE LINEMAN IS COMING OUT HERE A LITTLE ANGRY TO START THIS SECOND HALF. &gt;&gt; GOT A STACK AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN, INCLUDING MATTHEWS THERE. YOU GOT LYNCH BACK IN THE GAME. IT'S THIRD DOWN AND 1. AND LYNCH IS GONNA GET STOPPED. AND THAT IS ROB NINKOVICH. HE COULDN'T GET BY NINKOVICH THERE. AND THAT'S GONNA SET UP FOURTH DOWN, AND HERE COMES THE FIELDGOAL GROUP. &gt;&gt; RIGHT OFF THE EDGE. NOBODY BLOCKED HIM. COME RIGHT DOWN THE LINE HERE, AND THAT'S JUST A VETERAN PLAYER UNDERSTANDING THE SITUATION. GONNA GIVE THE BALL TO MARSHAWN LYNCH, AND HE JUST BEATS THEM TO THE PUNCH. &gt;&gt; THAT SETS UP A 27YARD FIELDGOAL ATTEMPT FOR STEVEN HAUSCHKA. 2 FOR 2 AT THE MEADOWLANDS LAST YEAR. AND THAT GIVES THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS THEIR FIRST LEAD OF THE NIGHT. BEAUTIFUL TONIGHT. ROOF OPEN. GOOD GAME. 1714. BELICHICK WORKING WITH HIS DEFENSE ON THE SIDELINE, AND TOM BRADY READY TO GET THE BALL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE SECOND HALF. &gt;&gt; THINK YOU ONLY HAVE TO SAY ONE THING \"SOMEBODY GO COVER CHRIS MATTHEWS.\" &gt;&gt; AMAZING. HAUSCHKA'S KICK. RESULTS IN A TOUCHBACK. DOESN'T GET MUCH BETTER. BILL BELICHICK TOOK OVER IN 2000. BRADY TOOK OVER AS THE STARTER IN '01. MOST NFL TITLE GAMES, HEAD COACH/QUARTERBACK DUO GO BACK TO OTTO GRAHAM AND PAUL BROWN. VINCE LOMBARDI, OF COURSE, AND BART STARR FOUR NFL CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES AND SUPER BOWLS I AND II. AND BRADY AND BELICHICK. PLAYING IN THEIR SIXTH SUPER BOWL. ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN VERY CLOSE. THE PREVIOUS FIVE HAVE BEEN DETERMINED BY 4 POINTS OR FEWER. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A 3POINT GAME. EARLY THIRD QUARTER. BRADY. QUICKLY TO THE OUTSIDE. AND TAKEN DOWN IS EDELMAN AFTER A GAIN OF A COUPLE. KAM CHANCELLOR RIGHT THERE. SECOND DOWN AND 8. &gt;&gt; HERE WE GO. KAM CHANCELLOR RIGHT OVER HERE, WHO HAS BEEN SORT OF THE UNDERNEATH COVERAGE GUY, AND THEY'RE TRYING TO JUST ISOLATE THOSE BIG GUYS. EDELMAN HAS BEEN THE QUICKNESS. SHANE VEREEN HAS BEEN THE QUICKNESS. AND SO FAR EVERYTHING'S GOING FINE, AND YET THEY LOOK AT THE SCOREBOARD AND IT'S 1714, SEATTLE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S GRONKOWSKI. SETS UP ON THE LEFT SIDE. PROVIDING LEVERAGE HERE. BLOUNT. CAN BARELY GET OUT OF THE BACKFIELD. McDANIEL IS THERE TO STOP HIM. IT'LL BE THIRD DOWN AND 6 FOR NEW ENGLAND. &gt;&gt; YEAH, AND NOW COMES THE SITUATION. IT'S BIG IF YOU CAN GET THEM BACK THIRD AND 6 AND KEEP THEM OUT OF THOSE THIRD AND 2s AND 3s, BECAUSE NOW YOUR PASS RUSH HAS A CHANCE. BUT SO FAR, IT HAS BEEN TOM BRADY'S ABILITY TO GET RID OF THE FOOTBALL BEFORE THAT PASS RUSH CAN GET THERE THAT HAS ALLOWED THEM TO MOVE THE BALL UP AND DOWN THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; THREE RECEIVERS SET TO THE RIGHT SIDE AND ONE LaFELL UP ON THE LEFT SIDE ON THIRD AND 6. SHOWING BLITZ. HERE THEY COME. BRADY GETS KNOCKED DOWN BUT GETS THE PASS AWAY. AND GRONKOWSKI HAS THE FIRST DOWN. SO BRADY GETS TAKEN TO THE GRASS BUT GETS IT AWAY AND CONVERTS. &gt;&gt; IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. MICHAEL BENNETT COULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN TO TOM BRADY ANY FASTER THAN THIS. RIGHT AROUND, RIGHT IN ON HIM. AND HE STILL DOESN'T GET THE PRESSURE THAT HE NEEDS. GRONKOWSKI ON THE OUTSIDE. WE'VE SEEN IT ALREADY. IF THEY'RE GOING TO PLAY MAN COVERAGE, SEATTLE'S GOING TO LOSE THOSE BATTLES KAM CHANCELLOR, K.J. WRIGHT. THIS GUY IS JUST TOO GOOD. UNANIMOUS ALLPRO. &gt;&gt; ANOTHER SET HERE WITH THE GUY LINED UP ON THE END AT THE RIGHT CAMERON FLEMING IS ELIGIBLE. THEY RUN IN THAT DIRECTION, WITH THE UNBALANCED LINE, AND BLOUNT PICKS UP A YARD. CHANCELLOR COMING UP TO STUFF HIM. SECOND DOWN. &gt;&gt; AL, DON'T YOU GET THE FEELING THAT THE PATRIOTS HAVE TO BE A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED? I THINK THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE A BETTER DAY RUNNING THE FOOTBALL. THEY'VE BEEN BRINGING THAT EXTRA OFFENSIVE LINEMAN/TIGHT END IN, IN CAMERON FLEMING, AND THEY JUST HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO ESTABLISH IT. SO IT'S ALL TOM BRADY. &gt;&gt; DEFINITELY. HAD THAT ONE DRIVE STYMIED ON THE INTERCEPTION, AND THEN TO GET BEAT BY A GUY NAMED CHRIS MATTHEWS, WHO'S NOT CAUGHT A PASS? AND THEN TO GIVE UP THE 5PLAY, 29YARD OR 29SECOND DRIVE AT THE END OF THE FIRST HALF. BRANDON BOLDEN IS NOW THE RUNNING BACK. HAVEN'T SEEN HIM. FAKE TO HIM. AND THEN THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE. BRADY TOSSING IT OVER THE MIDDLE, PRESSURE PUT ON BY BENNETT. WAS ANYBODY IN THE AREA? &gt;&gt; HE WAS DEFINITELY UNDER PRESSURE AGAIN. MICHAEL BENNETT. HERE WE GO. RIGHT DOWN INSIDE. AND HE'S GOING TO GET THERE AGAIN. &gt;&gt; COULD THIS BE GROUNDING? LOOK AT THIS HERE. OKAY, PRESSURE. WHO IS HE THROWING IT TO? &gt;&gt; WELL, I... THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; HELLO? THIRD DOWN AND 9. PLAY CLOCK AT :01. BRADY. OVER THE MIDDLE. AND IT'S PICKED OFF AT THE 42YARD LINE BY BOBBY WAGNER! SECOND INTERCEPTION. BOBBY WAGNER, OVER THE MIDDLE. THERE'S A FLAG ON THE PLAY. THE FLAG IS UP TO THE 41YARD LINE. AVRIL IS DOWN. LANE HAD THE EARLY INTERCEPTION, AND HE GOT HURT AND IS OUT FOR THE GAME. YOU'VE GOT AVRIL DOWN. YOU GOT A PENALTY FLAG DOWNFIELD. AND VINOVICH WILL LET US KNOW. IN THE MEANTIME, BRADY'S ALREADY WALKING OFF THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; HERE WE GO. WATCH WAGNER. AS THIS COMES ACROSS, HE GOES THAT WAY AND COMES BACK. BRADY THOUGHT THAT HE HAD CLEARED WAGNER WHEN GRONKOWSKI SETTLED DOWN. WAGNER, ATHLETIC ENOUGH TO JUMP BACK UNDERNEATH IT FOR THE HUGE PLAY. &gt;&gt; AND THE PENALTY IS AFTER &gt;&gt; AFTER THE INTERCEPTION, DURING THE RETURN, ILLEGAL BLOCK IN THE BACK. INTERCEPTING TEAM, NUMBER 25. 10YARD PENALTY FROM THE SPOT OF THE FOUL. SEATTLE KEEPS THE BALL. FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; AFTER THE PICK. THE PENALTY IS ON RICHARD SHERMAN FOR THE ILLEGAL BLOCK IN THE BACK. SO THAT MOVES THE BALL BACK TO THE MIDFIELD STRIPE. RIGHT ON THE 50YARD LINE. WITH 8:07 LEFT IN THE THIRD. AND THERE'S SHERMAN AND WAGNER. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT, AL? SOMETIMES, EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T GET THE SACKS, IF YOU GET THE HITS, IT ACCELERATES THE PROCESS IN THE QUARTERBACK'S MIND. AND I THINK THAT THEY HURRIED THE CLOCK OF TOM BRADY ON THAT THROW. BOBBY WAGNER, WHAT A DIFFERENCE WHEN HE CAME BACK IN THE LINEUP, RIGHT? UNDER 10 POINTS A GAME. &gt;&gt; MISSED FIVE GAMES TURF TOE. PICKED IN THAT SAME DRAFT, JUST AHEAD OF RUSSELL WILSON IN 2012. NOW WILSON SLINGS ONE TO THE LEFT SIDE. MATTHEWS AGAIN. THIS IS JUST AMAZING. 41YARD LINE. HE PLAYED IN THE CFL FOR TWO YEARS. WAS THE ROOKIE OF THE YEAR IN THE CANADIAN FOOTBALL LEAGUE BACK IN 2012. &gt;&gt; BRANDON BROWNER IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST, BADDEST CORNERS I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. AND MATTHEWS THAT TIME JUST THREW HIM OFF. I MEAN, THESE ARE TWO HUGE MEN GOING AT IT ON THE OUTSIDE. I THINK THEY MAKE THE SWITCH BECAUSE BROWNER HAS MORE SIZE. HE CAN JUMP UP AND HANDLE THOSE JUMP BALLS. BUT NOW CAN HE HANDLE HIS QUICKNESS? &gt;&gt; SECOND AND 1 FROM THE 41. AND LYNCH... TO MOVE THE STICKS. YOU KNOW, YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT CHRIS MATTHEWS. DARRELL BEVELL, THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR NICKNAMED HIM \"HARDBALL\" FOR CHRIS MATTHEWS OF MSNBC, WHO IS HERE AT THE GAME TODAY. AND THIS CHRIS MATTHEWS THE SEAHAWKS' CHRIS MATTHEWS SAID, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. EVERY TIME I WIKIPEDIA MYSELF, IT KEEPS COMING UP THE OTHER GUY.\" TOMORROW HE MAY SUPPLANT MSNBC's CHRIS MATTHEWS IN THE NUMBERONE SPOT. &gt;&gt; JUST JUMP RIGHT OVER. HE MAY BE THERE RIGHT NOW. I WOULD SAY HE'S TRENDING. YOU AND I ARE SO HIP. BUT I WOULD SAY HE'S TRENDING RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; NO QUESTION. FROM THE 38YARD LINE. OFF THE PISTOL FORMATION. WILSON HAS TIME. LOOK HOW ELUSIVE HE IS. THERE'S A FLAG DOWN, HOWEVER. THERE IT IS. YOU SAW IT AT THE 31YARD LINE. AND WILSON WILL SLIDE TO A STOP AT THE 21, AND WE'LL GET THE CALL FROM VINOVICH. &gt;&gt; YOU CANNOT GET A HAND ON RUSSELL WILSON. &gt;&gt; HOLDING. DEFENSE, NUMBER 39. 5YARD PENALTY FROM THE END OF THE RUN. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S BRANDON BROWNER. THAT'S NOTHING NEW, BECAUSE HE DRAWS A TON OF PENALTIES. &gt;&gt; THIS IS HILARIOUS. CHANDLER JONES LOOK AT THIS. DEAD TO RIGHTS, RIGHT? CAN'T EVEN GET A FINGER ON RUSSELL WILSON. WILSON SAW IT COMING THE WHOLE TIME. HE JUST VERY CASUALLY LOOKED LIKE HE WAS LOOKING DOWNFIELD, BUT SAW HIM OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE. THEN THAT LITTLE MOVE OF HIS, AND TAKES OFF. THIS GUY IS SOMETHING SPECIAL. &gt;&gt; BROWNER, 39. THERE'S THE PENALTY. HOLDING ON TO KEARSE. AND SHOVING HIM. SETTING UP A FIRST DOWN AT THE 18YARD LINE. LYNCH. STILL GOING. TO THE 4. HE'S JUST A RUNAWAY TRUCK. TACKLED BY NINKOVICH. &gt;&gt; WATCH THE MOVE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HOLE. RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS RUN I THINK THAT'S JAMIE COLLINS THAT CAME DOWN THERE HE IS AL, YOU DESCRIBED HIM EARLIER AS A SPLITFOOTED RUNNER. HE RUNS WITH HIS FEET SO FAR APART, IT ALLOWS HIM TO MAKE THESE LATERAL CUTS, AND PEOPLE REALLY GOOD TACKLERS CAN'T GET THEIR ARMS WRAPPED AROUND HIM. &gt;&gt; TUKUAFU'S THE FULLBACK. FROM THE 4. GIVE IT TO MARSHAWN. TO THE 3YARD LINE HE GOES. GAIN OF 1. SECOND AND GOAL. THE HAWKS' LAST FOUR DRIVES HAVE BEEN TOUCHDOWN, FIELD GOAL, TOUCHDOWN, AND IN PROGRESS RIGHT HERE. &gt;&gt; HERE'S WHERE YOU REALLY FOR TOM BRADY, YOU KIND OF GOT TO JUST KEEP IT TOGETHER, RIGHT? OKAY, YOU MADE A BIG MISTAKE TO START THE FIRST HALF, YOU MAKE A BIG MISTAKE HERE IN THE SECOND HALF. BUT THESE TWO TEAMS HAVE PLAYED FROM BEHIND DURING THE ENTIRETY OF THESE PLAYOFFS. NO BIG DEAL. &gt;&gt; SECOND AND GOAL. PLAY FAKE. LITTLE LOB. WIDE OPEN! TOUCHDOWN, DOUG BALDWIN! AFTER THE WAGNER INTERCEPTION, SIX PLAYS, 50 YARDS. FLAG WENT DOWN. THERE WILL BE A CELEBRATION PENALTY, WHICH WILL BE ASSESSED ON THE KICKOFF. &gt;&gt; PLAYACTION TO GET THE RUN GAME GOING. BUT LET'S GIVE CREDIT TO DOUG BALDWIN. A VETERAN PLAYER. &gt;&gt; AFTER THE TOUCHDOWN, UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT. OFFENSE, NUMBER 89. 15YARD PENALTY ON THE KICKOFF. TOUCHDOWN IS GOOD. &gt;&gt; VETERAN RECEIVER KNOWS HOW TO USE THE UMPIRE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD TO PICK OFF THE MAN COVERAGE. HE DID IT PERFECTLY. BRILLIANT PLAY BY DOUG BALDWIN. &gt;&gt; DOUG BALDWIN. HIS FIRST CATCH. PLAYED AT STANFORD. THERE'S A GUY WHO HIT THE MOTHER LODE. HOW ABOUT CATCHING PASSES FROM ANDREW LUCK IN COLLEGE AND RUSSELL WILSON AS A PRO? HAUSCHKA FOR THE EXTRA POINT. CASH IN TOUCHDOWN AFTER THE TURNOVER. &gt;&gt; WE SAW RICHARD SHERMAN GOING, \"24, 24.\" HERE'S WHAT HE WAS SAYING. WHO IS THE BEST CORNERBACK IN ALL OF FOOTBALL? WELL, PART OF THE DEBATE, DARRELLE REVIS, 24, JUST GOT BEAT. \"24. THAT MAKES ME NUMBER ONE.\" [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, HE'S BETTER THAN HALF THE LOUNGE ACTS IN VEGAS. HE'S TAKEN INTERVIEW SESSIONS TO PERFORMANCE ART. WHAT A CHARACTER. AND ONE HECK OF A PLAYER, BY THE WAY. AFTER THE PENALTY, THE KICKOFF FROM 15 YARDS FARTHER BACK. AND DANNY AMENDOLA RUNS IT BACK OUT TO THE 37. PETE CARROLL TOOK OVER IN 2010. HEAD COACH FACING HIS SUCCESSOR AND FORMER TEAM GO BACK TO SUPER BOWL III, ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT GAMES IN THE HISTORY OF THE NFL. WEEB EWBANK BEAT DON SHULA. THAT'S THE JOE NAMATH GAME. YOU GO BACK TO 2002 JON GRUDEN HAD LEFT OAKLAND FOR SOME DRAFT CHOICES, BILL CALLAHAN TOOK OVER, AND GRUDEN WON A SUPER BOWL WITH THE TEAM THAT TONY DUNGY HAD LEFT AT THAT POINT. &gt;&gt; AND PETE CARROLL ONE OF THE MOST COMPETITIVE GUYS IN ALL OF FOOTBALL. WHEN WE ASKED HIM ABOUT IT, HE SAID, \"WHEN I GOT FIRED, I DON'T THINK THEY REALIZED WHAT THEY WERE LOSING.\" MAY PROVE PROPHETIC HERE IF THIS SCORE HOLDS. &gt;&gt; THREE YEARS THERE, THEN ON TO S.C. AND FIVE YEARS NOW THERE. AND BRADY THROWS. AND THAT PASS IS CAUGHT. EDELMAN. FLAG IS DOWN. COULD BE A HOLD. AT THE 48YARD LINE. VINOVICH WILL MAKE THE CALL RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; HOLDING. OFFENSE, NUMBER 66. &gt;&gt; COMING BACK. &gt;&gt; 10YARD PENALTY. REPEAT FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; BRYAN STORK. THAT'S THE CENTER. &gt;&gt; RIGHT HERE. YOU CAN'T BLOCK THIS GUY. MICHAEL BENNETT IS SIMPLY TAKING OVER THE FOOTBALL GAME. BRYAN STORK, A ROOKIE IN THERE, VOTED THE RIMINGTON AWARD, BEST CENTER IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL. NOBODY'S BEEN ABLE TO BLOCK MICHAEL BENNETT ALL NIGHT. &gt;&gt; TALKING TO PETE CARROLL THE OTHER DAY, FIRED BY THE JETS, FIRED BY THE PATRIOTS. SOMETIMES IT'S A LITTLE DICEY BRINGING IT UP, BUT HE SAID, \"MY THERAPIST TELLS ME TO TALK ABOUT IT.\" [ BOTH LAUGH ] FIRST AND 20 FROM THE 25YARD LINE. BRADY GOING DEEP DOWN THE LEFT SIDELINE. AND THROWS THAT ONE ON THE CHALK. INTENDED FOR LaFELL. WE GO TO MICHELE. &gt;&gt; SEATTLE STARTING DEFENSIVE END CLIFF AVRIL TOOK A HEAVY HIT. HE HAS GONE TO THE LOCKER ROOM FOR A CONCUSSION EVALUATION. QUESTIONABLE WITH A HEAD INJURY. HE WAS ESCORTED OFF THE FIELD AND TO THE LOCKER ROOM BY THE TEAM INTERNIST AS WELL AS THE LEAGUE'S UNAFFILIATED NEUROTRAUMA CONSULTANT, SO ON HIS WAY TO THAT CONCUSSION PROTOCOL, AL. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, MICHELE. THAT MEANS O'BRIEN SCHOFIELD, WHO WEARS NUMBER 93, COMES IN TO TAKE OVER THAT SPOT. THERE HE IS. FIFTHYEAR GUY OUT OF WISCONSIN. PLAYED HERE WITH THE CARDINALS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. SECOND DOWN AND 20. AND BRADY WILL DUMP IT OFF UNDERNEATH. EDELMAN LOOKING FOR ROOM. PICKS UP ABOUT 6 EXTRA YARDS AFTER HE WAS INITIALLY STOPPED. GETS THE BALL OUT TO THE 36YARD LINE. IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND 9 FOR THE PATS. &gt;&gt; WELL, HERE WE GO. DOWN THE FIELD. BRANDON LaFELL AND RICHARD SHERMAN. OBVIOUSLY LaFELL NOT EVEN REALLY LOOKING FOR A PASS. THAT'S ONE OF THOSE UNDERPLAYS WHERE HE KNOWS ALL ALONG HIS JOB IS TO BLOCK. &gt;&gt; KEY THIRD AND 9. AMENDOLA COMES THIS WAY AND THAT WAY. AND BRADY WILL FIRE. AND IT IS AMENDOLA WHO CAN'T MAKE THE CATCH. AMENDOLA WITH WAGNER RIGHT THERE. AND FOURTH AND 9, AND IN COMES THE PUNTING GROUP. &gt;&gt; AMENDOLA RIGHT HERE. AND THEN I THINK HE GETS A GLANCE AT BOBBY WAGNER COMING RIGHT FOR HIS CHIN STRAP. BUT THAT'S A MISS BY BRADY. JUST HAD A CHANCE THERE. LOOKED LIKE IT HIT HIM PRETTY GOOD, BUT MAYBE A LITTLE FLINCH. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE WAGNER ALREADY WITH 11 TACKLES AND AN INTERCEPTION. AND THE PUNT... CANNOT BE SAVED. &gt;&gt; STRATEGY PRETTY CLEAR FOR THE PATRIOTS ON DEFENSE. WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO IS PLAY THE FOUR BIG DEFENSIVE LINEMEN UP FRONT, PUT JAMIE COLLINS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DEFENSE AND LET HIM RUN SIDELINE TO SIDELINE AND MAKE PLAYS. HE'S MADE SOME PRETTY NICE PLAYS INSIDE, TRACKING DOWN MARSHAWN LYNCH. BUT IT WAS THE PLAY RIGHT BEFORE THE HALF THAT REALLY MADE THE DIFFERENCE. HE DID NOT GET THE PROPER LEVERAGE ON RUSSELL WILSON. WILSON'S QUICKNESS HAS BEEN A FACTOR ALL NIGHT. AND THAT ONE RIGHT THERE SET UP THAT TOUCHDOWN RIGHT BEFORE THE HALF. BIG, BIG, BIG MISTAKE. &gt;&gt; LYNCH HAS CARRIED FOR 88 YARDS. WILSON ONLY 3 CARRIES, BUT FOR 39. LOOK AT THE TIME HE HAS. AND THEN CAUGHT UP AT THE 45YARD LINE. RICARDO LOCKETTE MAKING THE GRAB. THAT'S A GAIN OF 25 YARDS. &gt;&gt; RICARDO LOCKETTE KIND OF MAKES ME LAUGH. THEY GO THE BOOTLEG PLAY OUT OF HERE. AND WATCH RUSSELL WILSON. THEY SAY HE DOESN'T READ DEFENSES? MY FOOT. HE MUST HAVE LOOKED AT FOUR DIFFERENT RECEIVERS ON THAT PLAY UNTIL HE FINALLY COMES ALL THE WAY ACROSS BACK TO THE BACK SIDE. RUSSELL WILSON IS GETTING VERY COMFORTABLE. THREE TOUCHDOWNS AND A FIELD GOAL, THE LAST FOUR DRIVES. &gt;&gt; AFTER NO YARDS, NO COMPLETIONS IN THE FIRST QUARTER AND MOST OF THE SECOND PERIOD. LYNCH. 2 TOUGH YARDS. 2 1/2 MINUTES REMAINING IN THE THIRD. &gt;&gt; YOU WATCH A PLAYER LIKE CHANDLER JONES HAVE A FREE SHOT LIKE HE HAD ON THAT PLAY AGAINST MARSHAWN LYNCH, AND HE BARELY SLOWED HIM DOWN. YOU KNOW? AND AS YOU GET INTO THE SECOND HALF, DEFENSES AND DEFENDERS, ESPECIALLY THE BIG GUYS, GET TIRED. AND MARSHAWN LYNCH, IF YOU'RE TIRED HE'S HARD ENOUGH WHEN YOU'RE FRESH. YOU'RE TIRED, IT GETS REALLY DIFFICULT. &gt;&gt; A LOT OF SPECULATION AS TO WHETHER THEY'LL KEEP HIM, WHETHER THEY CAN AFFORD HIM. THERE'S SOME SPECULATION THAT THEY'RE READY TO MAKE A BIG LONGTERM DEAL WITH HIM GOING FORWARD. CATCH MADE ON THE OUTSIDE. THAT'S JERMAINE KEARSE. MALCOLM BUTLER MAKES THE TACKLE. KEARSE, THE BIG HERO AT THE END OF THE GAME AGAINST GREEN BAY WITH THE OVERTIME CATCH. HIS ONLY CATCH OF THAT GAME, AFTER HE'D BEEN TARGETED SIX TIMES. ALL FOUR WILSON INTERCEPTIONS WERE ON PASSES INTENDED FOR HIM. THE OTHER ONE WAS INCOMPLETE. &gt;&gt; HOW ABOUT A GUY THAT HAD THE GAMEWINNING TOUCHDOWN IN BACKTOBACK CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES? &gt;&gt; AMAZING. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? NFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES AGAINST SAN FRANCISCO ON THAT FOURTHDOWN PLAY THE YEAR BEFORE. COMES RIGHT BACK WITH ANOTHER ONE. &gt;&gt; AND HOW ABOUT A QUARTERBACK WHO KEEPS GOING TO A GUY WHO KEEPS GETTING INTERCEPTED EVERY TIME HE'S TARGETED? THIRD AND 3. WILSON SURVEYS. AND IT IS BOBBLED AND DROPPED. THAT TIME IT'S KEARSE AGAIN. MALCOLM BUTLER, ONE OF THE EXTRA DEFENSIVE BACKS, COMES IN TO HELP BREAK IT UP. IT'LL BE FOURTH DOWN AND 3. &gt;&gt; GONNA GO HERE AND BACK AROUND. JUST A LITTLE RUB ROUTE, AND THEY GOT IT. THEY HAD THE ROOKIE, MALCOLM BUTLER. AND THAT TIME KEARSE JUST COULD NOT HOLD ON TO IT. HUGE PLAY. THAT IS IN SCORING POSITION, OR YOUR PUNTER COMES ON THE FIELD. AND HERE COMES JON RYAN. &gt;&gt; JULIAN EDELMAN SETS UP INSIDE HIS OWN 10YARD LINE. OOH, LOW SNAP. PICKS IT UP AND GETS IT AWAY. EDELMAN SAYS STAY AWAY FROM IT. AND IT BOUNDS OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 11YARD LINE. 2414. YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK AT THE PATH THAT EACH OF THESE TEAMS TOOK. 22 WAS NEW ENGLAND GOING INTO WEEK 5. THEY LOST IN KANSAS CITY ON THAT MONDAY NIGHT. THE SKY'S FALLING. SEATTLE WAS 33, THEN THEY WERE 64. HAD THAT BIG MEETING THAT BEGAN TO TURN THINGS AROUND. &gt;&gt; YEAH. AND GO FIGURE. HERE'S A TEAM DOWN 160 AGAINST THE GREEN BAY PACKERS, BUT THEIR DEFENSE HUNG IN THERE SO WELL ALL THOSE TURNOVERS IN THE FIRST HALF TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO GET TO THIS GAME. AND NOW THEIR DEFENSE AGAIN DELIVERING. AND RUSSELL WILSON, MARSHAWN LYNCH, PUTTING ON A SHOW, AS WELL. &gt;&gt; AND NEW ENGLAND KNOWS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO COME FROM BEHIND. THEY WERE DOWN TWICE BY 14 IN THE DIVISIONAL ROUND TO THE RAVENS. THEY START THIS DRIVE WITH VEREEN TAKING THE BALL UP TO THE 17YARD LINE FOR A SHORT GAIN. CHANCELLOR MAKES THE TACKLE. THAT KNEE SEEMS TO BE FINE. PLAYING WITH THE BRACE TODAY. &gt;&gt; INTERESTING HERE, AL, THAT NOW WE'RE GETTING SHANE VEREEN IN THE BACKFIELD. THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO POUND IT IN THERE WITH LeGARRETTE BLOUNT, AND HERE HE COMES BACK IN THE GAME NOW, BUT YOU WONDER NOW, AS A PLAY CALLER, IS JOSH McDANIELS GETTING A LITTLE FRUSTRATED? SOMETIMES VEREEN I'VE SEEN HIM COME IN AT THE END OF OTHER GAMES AND GIVE THEM A LITTLE BURST. MAYBE HE'S THINKING IT MAY BE TIME. &gt;&gt; HE'S GOT BLOUNT. THEY ALSO PUT THE FULLBACK IN THERE, DEVELIN. AND BRADY, OFF PLAYACTION, THROWS. CAUGHT. IT WILL BE A GAIN CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN. DEVELIN MAKES THE CATCH. HE SCORED A TOUCHDOWN IN THE AFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. THAT'S GONNA TAKE US TO THE FOURTH QUARTER. SEAHAWKS OWNER PAUL ALLEN, G.M. JOHN SCHNEIDER. PAUL ALLEN BOUGHT THE TEAM IN '97. STARTED MICROSOFT WITH BILL GATES. LEFT THERE IN '83. MADE A TON OF MONEY, BUT HE'S BEEN A PHENOMENAL PHILANTHROPIST. MICROSOFT ALL OVER THE PLACE HERE RIGHT NOW. HE'S GIVEN AWAY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS, I THINK EVEN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO FIGHT DISEASES, MEDICAL RESEARCH FACILITIES, AND ALL OF THE REST. BUT KIND OF AN UNDERTHERADAR GUY WHO'S NOW WATCHED HIS TEAM GET TO THREE SUPER BOWLS IN THE LAST 10 YEARS. THIRD AND 1. AL MICHAELS, CRIS COLLINSWORTH, MICHELE TAFOYA. 15 MINUTES TO GO IN REGULATION. THIRD AND 1. FROM THE 23YARD LINE. IN A 10POINT GAME. BLOUNT. GOT HIM BY THE SHIRTTAIL. CAN'T GET AWAY. TONY McDANIEL WAS ABLE TO BRING HIM BACK. AND THEY HAVE TO PUNT ON A FOURTH DOWN. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THEM MUCH, BUT TONY McDANIEL, KEVIN WILLIAMS, RIGHT UP THE MIDDLE, THE BIG GUYS. WHEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE A STOP IN A THIRDAND1 SITUATION, YOU HAVE TO GET IN THE BACKFIELD TO BE ABLE TO SLOW DOWN A LeGARRETTE BLOUNT. THEY GOT THE JOB DONE THERE. &gt;&gt; WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE TEARAWAY JERSEYS? &gt;&gt; [ CHUCKLES ] &gt;&gt; LOW LINEDRIVE KICK. COMING UP TO FIELD IT IS WALTERS AT THE 31. AND HE GETS TACKLED AT THE 35YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; HERE WE GO. A LITTLE HARDBALL WITH CHRIS MATTHEWS. DOWN THE FIELD. THIS IS THE ONE. THIS OFFENSE WAS STUCK IN THE MUD UNTIL MATTHEWS MADE THAT PLAY. RIGHT BEFORE THE HALF, 6 SECONDS TO GO, WHO DO YOU THROW IT TO? OF COURSE, THE GUY THAT DOESN'T HAVE A CATCH ALL YEAR. AND THEN DOWN THE FIELD AGAINST ARRINGTON. OH, MAYBE A LITTLE PUSHOFF. GETS AWAY WITH IT. HE HAS BEEN THE DIFFERENCE IN THE GAME. FINALLY JUMPSTARTING THAT PASSING GAME. &gt;&gt; ROD SMITH OF THE BRONCOS, MOST YARDS BY AN UNDRAFTED FREE AGENT. MATTHEWS PLAYED THOSE TWO YEARS IN CANADA. WAS THE ROOKIE OF THE YEAR IN THE CFL. WAS WORKING IN A SPORTINGGOODS STORE, SELLING SHOES, WHEN SEATTLE CALLED AND SAID, \"GET UP HERE FOR A TRYOUT.\" &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS UP. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU CANNOT MAKE THIS UP. FROM THE 36YARD LINE. THAT'S WHAT WE LOVE ABOUT SPORTS. GAIN OF 3 FOR MARSHAWN LYNCH. &gt;&gt; NOW I THINK YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE SOME RUN BLITZES HERE OUT OF THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS. HERE COMES JAMIE COLLINS. THIS IS NOT EXPECTING A PASS. THAT IS SO THEY CAN CLOG UP THE MIDDLE AGAINST MARSHAWN LYNCH AND CREATE SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE OTHER LINEBACKER THERE, DONT'A HIGHTOWER, TO COME OVER AND HELP MAKE THE TACKLE. &gt;&gt; SECOND AND 8. LITTLE OVER A MINUTE INTO THE FOURTH QUARTER. LYNCH. OH, HE GETS POPPED. BRANCH IS RIGHT THERE, FORMER SEAHAWK, TO MAKE SURE HE GOES NOWHERE. THIRD DOWN. &gt;&gt; BIG OLD VINCE WILFORK. YOU RUN IN THERE AT YOUR OWN RISK. JUST GONNA MAKE A PLAY. LOOK AT TRYING TO BLOCK THAT GUY. J.R. SWEEZY'S HAD A NICE GAME, BUT ANYTIME YOU SEE VINCE WILFORK CONTACT, ARMS FULLY EXTENDED. THAT MEANS HE'S TOTALLY UNDER CONTROL IN THERE. THEN JUST STYMIED MARSHAWN LYNCH. &gt;&gt; WILFORK AND BRADY, THE TWO REMAINING GUYS FROM THEIR LAST SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM IN 2004. THIRD AND 7. WILSON WITH A TON OF TIME. AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HERE THROUGH THE MIDDLE COMES ROB NINKOVICH. FOUND THE CREASE, GETS IN THERE. BIG SACK. HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO NINKOVICH. HE'S 31 TODAY. &gt;&gt; COVERAGE SACK HERE. DARRELLE REVIS ON THE INSIDE ON DOUG BALDWIN. MAYBE A CHANCE THERE, BUT THAT PRESSURE REALLY TOOK A LONG TIME TO MATERIALIZE. YOU JUST WONDER IF RUSSELL WILSON WAS PROBABLY LOOKING ON THE OUTSIDE THERE. THEN NINKOVICH, THE OLD VETERAN. EIGHT SACKS ON THE YEAR FOR THE THIRD STRAIGHT YEAR, AND NOW THE PATRIOTS HAVE GOT TO GET SOMETHING GOING ON THE OFFENSIVE SIDE. &gt;&gt; THREE SACKS FOR THE PATS. RYAN'S KICK. COLLECTED AT THE 18. EDELMAN. GOOD RUNBACK OUT TO THE 33YARD LINE. THE TWO T.D.s, TYING HIM WITH MONTANA ALL TIME WITH 11. TWO INTERCEPTIONS. AND WE'RE GETTING A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO SERIOUS CRUNCH TIME. &gt;&gt; NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. AND FOR TOM BRADY, IT HAS BEEN A WEEK OF DISTRACTIONS. HE'S HAD GOOD MOMENTS IN THIS GAME. HE'S MADE SOME BIG MISTAKES. I'M SURE IT'S BEEN TOUGH TO FOCUS THIS WEEK. &gt;&gt; TWO FULL WEEKS. HE STARTS FROM THE 32. AND HE'S GOING TO GET SACKED. EVERYBODY COVERED. AND BRUCE IRVIN COMES IN TO KNOCK HIM DOWN. &gt;&gt; COVERAGE ALL OVER THE FIELD. RICHARD SHERMAN, WHO GAVE UP THE FIRST PASS OF THE GAME, AND THAT HAS BEEN IT. GRONKOWSKI, WHEN HE ENDED UP IN ONEONONE COVERAGE AGAINST K.J. WRIGHT, HAD A PLAY. BUT JUST NOWHERE TO THROW THE FOOTBALL. &gt;&gt; 8YARD SACK. THAT'S SEATTLE'S FIRST SACK OF THE GAME. PATRIOTS HAVE THREE. SECOND AND 18. SLINGS IT TO THE OUTSIDE TO BRANDON LaFELL. NOT A LOT OF ROOM. SHERMAN THERE. FOR TOM BRADY, YOU KNOW, I THINK IT STARTED OUT CHRONOLOGICALLY. HE COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT THE DEAL WAS THE DAY AFTER THE INDIANAPOLIS GAME. THEN HE PLAYED A LOT OF DEFENSE THE FIRST WEEK. THEN THEY GET HERE, HE DID THAT INTERVIEW WITH BOB ON TUESDAY. &gt;&gt; WHICH LOOKED A LITTLE UNCERTAIN. &gt;&gt; HE WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE. BUT THEN HE TOLD YOU AS YOU LOOK AT ROGER GOODELL HE TOLD YOU ON WEDNESDAY TO YOUR FACE. &gt;&gt; I SAID, \"TOM, LOOK ME IN THE EYE AND TELL ME YOU COULDN'T HAVE POSSIBLY SAID ANYTHING TO A BALL BOY, AN ASSISTANT COACH, SOMEBODY IN THE ORGANIZATION THAT WOULD LEAD THEM TO BELIEVE THAT YOU WANTED AIR LET OUT OF THAT FOOTBALL.\" AND HE SAID, \"ABSOLUTELY NOT.\" HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE EMPHATIC. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 14. AND BRADY'S GOING TO STEP UP, FIRE OVER THE MIDDLE &gt;&gt; OH! &gt;&gt; AND IT IS TAKEN BY EDELMAN. AND EDELMAN WAS NOT DOWN, EVEN THOUGH HIT BY CHANCELLOR. THEY'RE GOING TO SAY THAT HIS KNEE TOUCHED, BUT THE OFFICIALS ARE GOING TO SPOT THE BALL INSIDE THE 40YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; WHAT A GREAT PLAY HERE BY EDELMAN. CHANCELLOR HIT HIM HARD. AND THEN THE FOREARM LOOKS TO BE DOWN, SO I THINK THEY'RE GONNA BRING THAT ONE BACK. &gt;&gt; I THINK THE KNEE WAS DOWN, TOO. &gt;&gt; FOREARM, ELBOW, KNEE. WE'RE GONNA GET IT ALL. &gt;&gt; NAME IT. &gt;&gt; RIGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; AND NOW ONE OFFICIAL COMES IN AND SAYS, \"NO, NO, HE'S DOWN.\" SO THEY'LL SPOT IT AT THE 49, BUT THAT'S STILL A FIRST DOWN. A GAIN OF 21 ON A THIRD AND 14. SO, VERY BIG PLAY FOR THE PATRIOTS, OBVIOUSLY. CLOCK TICKING DOWN TO THE 10MINUTE MARK. FIRST DOWN AT THE 49. &gt;&gt; TELL YOU, YOU RUN A ROUTE ACROSS THE MIDDLE AGAINST THIS DEFENSE, YOU DO SO AGAINST YOUR OWN RISK WITH KAM CHANCELLOR IN THERE. &gt;&gt; BRADY HAS TO DUMP IT TO VEREEN. HE SWINGS TO THE OUTSIDE. SKIRTS THE SIDELINE. CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN BEFORE HE'S THRUST OUT. LATE HIT, FLAG ON THE PLAY. &gt;&gt; PERSONAL FOUL. UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS. DEFENSE, NUMBER 29. LATE HIT OUT OF BOUNDS. 15YARD PENALTY ON THE END OF THE RUN. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; EARL THOMAS. &gt;&gt; HEADY PLAY BY NATE SOLDER HERE. WATCH HIM SET OUTSIDE TO INVITE AVRIL INSIDE, WHICH REALLY SETS THE SPACE FOR THE SCREEN PLAY ON THE OUTSIDE TO SHANE VEREEN. &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S THOMAS KNOCKING HIM DOWN. HE HAD HELP, AS WELL. EARL, NUMBER 29. CALL WENT ON HIM. PATS HAVE IT AT THE 27. FAKE TO VEREEN. BRADY GOING FOR 6. KNOCKED AWAY. BRANDON LaFELL THE INTENDED RECEIVER, AND THAROLD SIMON, WHO CAME IN FOR THE INJURED JEREMY LANE EARLY AND A GUY THEY WERE PICKING ON, WITH THE DEFENSE. &gt;&gt; FANTASTIC PLAY BY THAROLD SIMON. UNDER SO MUCH PRESSURE IN THIS GAME, HAVING TO COME IN, HAVING TO DELIVER. GETS HIS RIGHT HAND ON THE BALL JUST ENOUGH TO FEEL THE RECEIVER ON THE OUTSIDE. GREAT, GREAT PLAY. SOMETIMES, AL, IN THESE BIG GAMES, IT'S THE GUYS YOU LEAST EXPECT, RIGHT? YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING THAT GAME ALL WEEK. WHO'S GOING TO BE THE SURPRISE MVP? &gt;&gt; OH, CHRIS MATTHEWS. WE ALL KNEW THAT, DIDN'T WE? &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; SECOND AND 10. VEREEN. CUTS IT BACK, TAKES IT TO THE 25. WE GO TO MICHELE. &gt;&gt; YOU MENTIONED HOW JEREMY LANE IS OUT OF THIS GAME AND NOW DEFENSIVE END CLIFF AVRIL IS OUT WITH A CONCUSSION. AND REMEMBER, UNDER THE CONCUSSION PROTOCOL, THE MADDEN RULE PREVENTS ANYONE DIAGNOSED WITH A CONCUSSION FROM COMING BACK OUT OF THE LOCKER ROOM. AND EVEN IF THEY WIN THIS GAME, AL, CLIFF AVRIL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TALK TO THE MEDIA. &gt;&gt; MM. THANK YOU, MICHELE. THERE HE IS. YOU SAW THE PLAY ON WHICH HE WAS HURT. BALL AT THE 25. CLEARLY THEY'RE ALREADY IN FIELDGOAL RANGE. THEY SPREAD IT OUT HERE. SO, AT WORST, THEY SHOULD, EVEN WITH AN INCOMPLETION, BE ABLE TO MAKE IT A ONEPOSSESSION GAME. BRADY LOOKING FOR MORE. STEPPING UP. THIRD AND 8. THROWS FIRST DOWN AND MORE. EDELMAN TAKES THE BALL TO THE 3YARD LINE TO SET UP A FIRST DOWN AND GOAL. AND EDELMAN, BOTHERED BY A HIP EARLY IN THE GAME AGAINST INDIANAPOLIS, A LITTLE SLOW IN GETTING UP. &gt;&gt; I THINK THIS IS DEMARCUS DOBBS, DROPS BACK IN COVERAGE, AND BRADY BRILLIANTLY JUST WAITS FOR HIM TO GET ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEFENSIVE LINEMAN. EDELMAN, NICE READ. GETS RIGHT ACROSS THE BACK SIDE THERE OF DOBBS. HUGE PLAY. &gt;&gt; BALL JUST INSIDE THE 5YARD LINE. 8:20 REMAINING IN REGULATION. EDELMAN HAS NOW CAUGHT 24 PASSES IN THE THREE POSTSEASON GAMES. VEREEN IS THE BACK. THE FAKE TO HIM. BRADY FIRES. AND INCOMPLETE. EDELMAN WAS BACKING UP. SIMON COVERING ON THE PLAY. INCOMPLETE, SECOND DOWN. &gt;&gt; OH, MY GOODNESS. WHAT A MOVE BY JULIAN EDELMAN HERE. WATCH THIS ONE. IN, STOP ON A DIME, BACK OUT. COULD NOT BE MORE WIDE OPEN, AND BRADY MISSED THE THROW. THAT'S AS OPEN AS YOU WILL EVER GET DOWN ON THE GOAL LINE. NO REASON TO HURRY THAT ONE. THAT WAS GAME, SET, AND MATCH. THAT WAS TOTAL VICTORY FOR A WIDE RECEIVER ON THE GOAL LINE. &gt;&gt; BLOUNT IS BACK IN. THE FAKE TO HIM. BRADY DANCES, THROWS. AND IT WILL BE CAUGHT. AMENDOLA FOR THE TOUCHDOWN! SO NEW ENGLAND GOES FROM A SECOND AND 18 AFTER THE FIRST PLAY ON THIS DRIVE TO GO 68 YARDS IN NINE PLAYS AND AN EXTRA POINT AWAY FROM MAKING IT A 3POINT GAME. &gt;&gt; DANNY AMENDOLA. AS POOR AS THE LAST THROW WAS FROM BRADY, THIS ONE IS THAT GOOD. HE JUST HAS TO WORK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF EARL THOMAS. HE SEES IT. THROW IT TO THE RIGHT SHOULDER. NO WAY THOMAS CAN GET THERE. WHEW! THIS GAME IS TURNING INTO SOMETHING HERE. &gt;&gt; WE THOUGHT IT WOULD. BUT YOU NEVER KNOW. &gt;&gt; SO DID THE ODDSMAKERS, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; TOSSUP, JUST ABOUT. FIVE CATCHES FOR AMENDOLA FOR 48 YARDS. GOSTKOWSKI FOR THE EXTRA POINT. &gt;&gt; WE COULD BE PLAYING FOOTBALL ALL NIGHT TONIGHT. EVEN IN OVERTIME, THEY PLAY UNTIL SOMEBODY WINS. &gt;&gt; TOM, WITH HIS THREE T.D.s TONIGHT HAS NOW PASSED MONTANA. ALL ALONE AS THE GUY THROWING THE MOST IN THE HISTORY OF THIS GAME. A DOZEN. GOSTKOWSKI'S KICK. WILL NOT BE RUN BACK. GLENDALE, ARIZONA. FOURTHQUARTER DEFENSE FOR THESE TWO TEAMS. SEATTLE'S LAST EIGHT GAMES, COUNTING THE TWO POSTSEASON GAMES, THEY'VE ALLOWED ONE TOUCHDOWN, 13 POINTS, THEN WENT THE LAST SIX REGULARSEASON GAMES WITHOUT ALLOWING A POINT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. AND THEN THE PATRIOTS, VERY SIMILAR, HAVE NOT ALLOWED A TOUCHDOWN IN THEIR LAST EIGHT GAMES, COUNTING THE TWO POSTSEASON GAMES. JUST FOUR FIELD GOALS. NOW, TONIGHT, NEW ENGLAND HAS SCORED HERE IN THE FOURTH, AND WE'LL SEE WHAT SEATTLE CAN MUSTER UP AS THEY START THIS DRIVE FROM THE 20YARD LINE. WILSON OFF PLAYACTION. SURVEYING. TON OF TIME. AND THEN THE RECEIVER FALLS DOWN. LOCKETTE LOOKS AROUND. HE SAYS, \"WHERE'S THE FLAG? I GOT KNOCKED DOWN.\" THERE IS NO FLAG. SECOND DOWN. &gt;&gt; WELL, IT LOOKED LIKE BUTLER TRIPS HERE. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY TRIP OVER EACH OTHER'S FEET. AND THEN HE REACHES OUT AND BASICALLY TRIPS THE RECEIVER. THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SOME SORT OF INTERFERENCE. THAT WAS DEFINITELY AN INTENTIONAL ACT. GOT AWAY WITH IT. &gt;&gt; HE DID. SECOND DOWN AND 10. TRIPS LEFT. THREE RECEIVERS THERE. LYNCH. FIGHTING. HE'S ALWAYS FIGHTING. TO THE 25YARD LINE. GAIN OF 5. THIRD AND 5. &gt;&gt; WHAT MAKES RUSSELL WILSON GREAT? ONE, HIS ESCAPABILITY. EVEN WHEN YOU THINK YOU COMPLETELY HAVE HIM UNDER CONTROL, YOU DON'T HAVE HIM UNDER CONTROL. YOU'VE GOT HIM DEAD IN YOUR SIGHTS, YOU CAN'T GET A HAND ON HIM. AND THEN THE DEEP BALLS. HIGH, ARCING THROWS, GIVING HIS RECEIVERS A CHANCE. THOSE TWO COMPONENTS HAVE BEEN THE DIFFERENCE HERE FOR THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS SO FAR. AND AS YOU GET TO THIS POINT IN THE GAME, RUSSELL WILSON RUNNING THE BALL ALWAYS BECOMES A BIG THREAT. &gt;&gt; ON THIRD AND 5. WILSON SLIDING RIGHT. AND THEN THROWS THAT ONE OUT OF BOUNDS. LYNCH GOING DOWN THE SIDELINE, AND INCOMPLETE. SO IT'S A VERY FAST THREEANDOUT. EXACTLY WHAT NEW ENGLAND WAS LOOKING FOR. &gt;&gt; LYNCH IS GOING TO DO A LITTLE OUT AND THEN UP. REALLY, HE WAS WIDE OPEN. JAMIE COLLINS CAME UNDERNEATH THAT LITTLE PICK, BUT IT LOOKED LIKE MARSHAWN LYNCH JUST SORT OF HESITATED AND STOPPED. DIDN'T REALLY BELIEVE HE WAS GOING TO THROW IT TO HIM, I GUESS. &gt;&gt; JON RYAN, WHO HAS AVERAGED 46 YARDS A PUNT. YOU SEE AMENDOLA BACKING UP AS THE SHORT MAN. POINTS BACK TO AMENDOLA. HE'LL CALL FOR A FAIR CATCH AND HAUL IT IN AT THE 36. ROBERT KRAFT BOUGHT THE TEAM IN THE MID'90s, TURNED A MEDIOCRE FRANCHISE INTO A JUGGERNAUT. HIS TEAMS HAVE GONE TO SEVEN SUPER BOWLS, INCLUDING ONE WITH BILL PARCELLS. HE'S ONLY HIRED TWO COACHES. THERE'S ONE OF THEM. THE OTHER IS ON THE OTHER SIDELINE. HE INHERITED PARCELLS. THERE IS BELICHICK WITH HIS DEFENSE. OF COURSE, IT'S GOING TO BE A WILD LAST SEVEN MINUTES FOR THE KRAFT FAMILY AND ALL PATRIOT FANS. AND WHO KNOWS WHAT THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WILL HOLD? FIRST THINGS FIRST. FROM THE 36YARD LINE. BRADY STARTS OUT OF THE GUN. VEREEN FLANKS HIM. FOURMAN RUSH. BRADY DUMPS. ONEHANDED GRAB BY VEREEN. GAIN OF 8 YARDS. WRIGHT AND CHANCELLOR ARE THERE. IT'LL BE SECOND DOWN AND 2. &gt;&gt; TOM BRADY REALLY WANTED TO GO TO GRONKOWSKI. BASICALLY, THEY CAN PICK A SIDE BECAUSE THESE CORNERS DON'T FLIP. HE LOOKED OUT THERE AND THOUGHT BETTER OF THROWING IT OVER TO RICHARD SHERMAN'S SIDE AND THEN GOT A BRILLIANT CATCH FROM VEREEN. IT IS SHANE VEREEN TIME IN THIS GAME. AND, REALLY, THAT'S WHEN THEY WERE HAVING SUCCESS EARLY WHEN THEY WERE WORKING THAT EDELMANVEREEN COMBINATION OVER THE MIDDLE. &gt;&gt; SECOND AND 2. BRADY TO THE OUTSIDE. THAT'S ENOUGH FOR A FIRST DOWN. THERE'S VEREEN. CHANCELLOR MAKES THE TACKLE. THAT MOVES THE STICKS. FIRST DOWN TO THE 48. &gt;&gt; THAT TIME GRONKOWSKI KNEW IT WAS MAN COVERAGE. RAN UP THE FIELD. JUST MADE KAM CHANCELLOR SHUFFLE A LITTLE BIT. AND ATHLETICALLY, YOU LIKE VEREEN ON CHANCELLOR IF YOU GET THAT MATCHUP. SO WE'LL SEE IF THEY COME BACK TO THAT. &gt;&gt; AS WE GO DOWN THE STRETCH, EACH TEAM WITH ITS FULL COMPLEMENT OF TIMEOUTS. &gt;&gt; CHANCELLOR ONEONONE ON GRONKOWSKI. &gt;&gt; EDELMAN OUT OF THE SLOT. SEND IT TO HIM. BREAKS A TACKLE. THEN ANOTHER. TAKES THE BALL CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN. JULIAN EDELMAN, QUARTERBACK AT KENT STATE. WHAT A PLAYER. WHAT A FIND THIS GUY WAS. SEVENTHROUND DRAFT CHOICE IN 2009. &gt;&gt; HE'S STRONG, AND HE'S ATHLETIC. BUT THE THING THAT I APPRECIATE MORE THAN ANYTHING ABOUT HIM GUY SHOWS UP AT THE COMPLEX AT 5:00 A.M. EVERY DAY. STUDIES, CATCHES EXTRA BALLS ON THE JUGS MACHINE. HE'S MADE HIMSELF A GREAT PLAYER IN THIS LEAGUE. &gt;&gt; UNDER FIVE MINUTES. SWING IT OUT. VEREEN. FIRST DOWN. FLAG COMES DOWN. VEREEN LOST THE BALL, BUT HE WAS DOWN ALREADY. AND WE'LL SEE ABOUT THE CALL. BILL VINOVICH, REFFING HIS FIRST SUPER BOWL GAME. ONLY EIGHT ACCEPTED PENALTIES IN THE GAME. &gt;&gt; PASS INTERFERENCE. OFFENSE, NUMBER 11. BLOCKING DOWNFIELD PRIOR TO THE CATCH. 10YARD PENALTY. REPEAT SECOND DOWN. &gt;&gt; SO THE CALL IS ON EDELMAN. IT BACKS MIGHT BE ON AMENDOLA. HE SAID 11, BUT IS THAT AMENDOLA? &gt;&gt; BUT HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED, AL. BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE, BRADY HAD TO LOB THAT PASS UP OVER THE TOP. SO THIS IS ONE OF THOSE DESIGNED PLAYS WHERE YOU'RE GONNA GO DOWN THE FIELD AND INTENTIONALLY BLOCK, THINKING THAT THIS PASS IS GOING TO COME OUT QUICKLY. BUT BECAUSE HE HAD TO LOB IT UP, THE BLOCKING GOT THERE TOO SOON, SO IT'S PASS INTERFERENCE. &gt;&gt; YEAH, HE JUST CHANGED IT. THEY DID CALL IT ON AMENDOLA. BRUCE IRVIN ALMOST GOT A HAND ON IT. SO INSTEAD OF SECOND AND 1, IT'S SECOND AND 11. WE GOT SHERMAN ON LaFELL. THEY HAVEN'T GONE SHERMAN'S WAY. STAYING AWAY FROM HIM. MUCH AS AARON RODGERS DID ON OPENING NIGHT. BRADY. HIT AS HE THROWS. CAUGHT BY GRONKOWSKI! AND THE BIG BULL TAKES IT TO THE 32YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE ROLLING THE DICE HERE. THEY'RE PUTTING THEIR BIG SAFETY, KAM CHANCELLOR, ON GRONKOWSKI. EARLIER THEY GOT BURNED WITH K.J. WRIGHT. YOU WANT TO GO MAN COVERAGE AND I THINK A LITTLE BIT, BECAUSE SHANE VEREEN'S BEEN EFFECTIVE COMING OUT OF THE BACKFIELD, THEY'VE HAD TO CHANGE UP THEIR SECONDARY COVERAGE A LITTLE BIT. AND RIGHT NOW JOSH McDANIELS GOT IT GOING WITH THIS PLAY CALLING. &gt;&gt; BRADY HUNG IN UNDER PRESSURE. BALL AT THE 32. ALREADY WITHIN GOSTKOWSKI'S FIELDGOAL RANGE. BRADY WILL SWING IT OUT. VEREEN. AND THERE'S RICHARD SHERMAN, WHOSE GIRLFRIEND IS PREGNANT. SHE'S DUE IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS, BUT SHE'S HERE. HE'S READY TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL IN UNIFORM IF NEED BE. &gt;&gt; WELL, AND RICHARD WAS TELLING US THAT SHE SAID, \"YOU GO PLAY THE SUPER BOWL. DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. I'VE GOT ALL THAT SET UP IF SOMETHING GETS ACCELERATED HERE.\" &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THAT. THROWN AT ONE TIME. ONCE. RICHARD SAYS, \"IT'S EVERYTHING I CAN DO TO KEEP FROM GETTING BORED.\" &gt;&gt; I GUARANTEE HE'S NOT BORED RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; MNHMNH. SECOND AND 10. LITTLE MORE THAN 4 TO GO. BRADY FIRES. CAUGHT. FIRST DOWN. AND AGAIN THEY GO TO GRONKOWSKI. OUT AT THE 20YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; AL, HERE IT IS AGAIN. THEY'RE JUST TELLING TOM BRADY THIS IS MAN COVERAGE. HE'S OFF. HE'S INSIDE. HE'S LOOKING RIGHT AT GRONKOWSKI. EVERYBODY IN THE BUILDING THAT KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT FOOTBALL KNOWS THAT'S MAN COVERAGE. AND 1,000% OF THE TIME NOW, THEY ARE GONNA THROW IT RIGHT THERE WHEN THEY GET THAT LOOK. &gt;&gt; HALF A DOZEN CATCHES FOR HIM. NOW THROUGH THE MIDDLE. BIG HOLE FOR VEREEN, AND HE TAKES THE BALL TO THE 12YARD LINE. BOBBY WAGNER IS THERE. YOU KNOW, 3:20, YOU BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT USING THE CLOCK. THEY'RE ALREADY IN FIELDGOAL RANGE, BUT SEATTLE STILL HAS ALL OF ITS TIMEOUTS. YOU STILL HAVE THE 2MINUTE WARNING. YOU'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE FOUR OPPORTUNITIES TO STOP THE CLOCK. &gt;&gt; THIS IS ABOUT SCORING A TOUCHDOWN RIGHT HERE. &gt;&gt; CORRECT. ANY WAY YOU CAN AT ANY TIME YOU CAN. &gt;&gt; NO CLOCK MANAGEMENT. &gt;&gt; NOT YET. NOT YET. THREE MINUTES TO GO. SECOND AND 3. BRADY TO THE OUTSIDE. CAUGHT AND THAT'S LaFELL BEFORE HE STEPS OUT OF BOUNDS. HE IS OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 6YARD LINE, AND THAT MAKES IT FIRST AND GOAL WITH 2:52 ON THE CLOCK. &gt;&gt; THEY FINALLY COME OUT OF THAT MAN COVERAGE AND GO A ZONE. BUT THEY'RE REALLY LUCKY THAT LaFELL ON THAT ONE COULDN'T GET HIMSELF UNDER CONTROL. BECAUSE I THINK HE WOULD HAVE SCORED. &gt;&gt; 71 IS REPORTING AS ELIGIBLE. 71 IS AN ELIGIBLE RECEIVER. &gt;&gt; YOU HEAR THE ANNOUNCEMENT. FLEMING COMES IN, THE TACKLE, AS AN ELIGIBLE RECEIVER 71. EARL THOMAS PLAYING THE MIDDLE. BRADY LOOKING AT THE CLOCK. BRADY SAYS, \"I'LL TAKE A TIMEOUT.\" PLAY CLOCK WAS ALL THE WAY DOWN TO :02. TOM WILL GO TO THE SIDELINE. &gt;&gt; FIRST CHARGED TIMEOUT. &gt;&gt; TOM BRADY TONIGHT HAS PUT IT UP 49 TIMES. THE 36 COMPLETIONS IS A SUPER BOWL RECORD. CRAZY TWO WEEKS. GREAT GAME. WHO KNOWS WHAT THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE WILL HOLD? &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I THINK EVERYBODY WE KNOW THE RAMIFICATIONS OF WHAT TED WELLS' INVESTIGATION IS GOING TO BE. SOMEBODY IS GOING TO COME OUT OF THIS WITH EGG ON THEIR FACE. EITHER THE PATRIOTS, THE LEAGUE OFFICE, THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE ACCUSED THE PATRIOTS. ALL THAT STUFF'S IN PLAY. BUT ISN'T IT GLORIOUS JUST FOR THESE THREE OR FOUR HOURS HERE, THAT YOU CAN JUST ENJOY A FOOTBALL GAME? &gt;&gt; WELL, AS THE OLD COACH JOHN MADDEN ALWAYS SAID, \"YOU KNOW, A GAME BREAKS OUT.\" AND IT BROKE OUT TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; BUT THERE ARE IT IS GOING TO BE BIG IN THE FOLLOWING MONTH. &gt;&gt; AGAIN, FLEMING AN ELIGIBLE RECEIVER, NUMBER 71. FIRST AND GOAL. THE BALL AT THE 6. DEVELIN, THE FULLBACK. BLOUNT IS THE RUNNING BACK. BLOUNT. AND BLOUNT POWERING HIS WAY TO THE 3YARD LINE. STOPPED THERE. GAIN OF 3. SECOND DOWN AND GOAL. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE GONNA TRY AND LOAD UP AND GO WITH THE BIG POWER RUNNER, EVEN THOUGH IT'S BASICALLY BEEN VEREEN AND THE MATCHUP PROBLEMS THAT HE HAS CREATED THAT'S GOTTEN THEM DOWN THE FIELD HERE. &gt;&gt; UNDER 2:30. BLOUNT OUT. VEREEN IN. SECOND AND GOAL. BRADY. CAUGHT TOUCHDOWN! JULIAN EDELMAN! &gt;&gt; CAME BACK TO IT, AL. THEY CAME RIGHT BACK TO IT. DOWN, BACK OUT. WORKED BRILLIANTLY BEFORE. BRADY MISSED THE PASS. COME RIGHT BACK TO IT, AND EDELMAN GETS IT DONE. NO PUSHOFF. NO FOUL. NO NOTHING. AND TOM BRADY TAKES THEM RIGHT DOWN THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; AND THERE AGAIN, THEY GO TO WORK ON THAROLD SIMON, WHO TOOK THE PLACE OF THE INJURED JEREMY LANE. THEY PICKED ON HIM EARLY. HE GOT HIS FEET UNDER HIM. PLAYED WELL FOR ABOUT A QUARTER AND A HALF. THEY GO BACK THAT WAY AGAIN AND BURN HIM. GOSTKOWSKI FOR THE EXTRA POINT. AND THAT MAKES IT A 4POINT LEAD, MEANING SEATTLE'S GONNA NEED A TOUCHDOWN. LAST TWO NEW ENGLAND DRIVES 9 PLAYS FOR 68, 10 PLAYS FOR 64. AND THE KRAFT FAMILY ROBERT AND JONATHAN. THEY'VE SEEN A FEW EXCITING GAMES. AGAIN, YOU'VE GOT A CLOSE GAME. EVERY SUPER BOWL THAT NEW ENGLAND'S PLAYED IN SINCE BELICHICK AND BRADY TOOK OVER HAS BEEN DECIDED BY 4 OR LESS. RUSSELL WILSON'S BEEN HERE BEFORE. HECK, HE WAS DOWN 160 TWO WEEKS AGO. &gt;&gt; I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK OF WHAT RUSSELL WILSON TOLD US. HE SAID, THE MINUTE I PULLED THAT TROPHY DOWN I HELD IT UP IN THE AIR AND I PULLED IT DOWN, AND I STARTED THINKING ABOUT THE NEXT ONE. I STARTED THINKING ABOUT THE NEXT SUPER BOWL OPPORTUNITY.\" HE SAID HE WANTED SIX. HE GREW UP REMEMBERING MICHAEL JORDAN HOLDING UP SIX FINGERS. HE SAID, \"I'M LOOKING FOR SIX.\" THIS SECOND ONE IS GOING TO BE ON HIS SHOULDERS WITH TWO MINUTES TO GO. &gt;&gt; SO 2:02. IF THE KICKOFF IS A TOUCHBACK, THEY'RE GOING TO GET A PLAY BEFORE THE 2MINUTE WARNING. OTHERWISE, THE CLOCK'S GOING TO STOP. THEY HAVE ALL OF THEIR TIMEOUTS. AND GOSTKOWSKI WILL SEND THAT ONE DEEP INTO THE NIGHT. SO THEY WILL GET ONE PLAY OFF BEFORE THE 2MINUTE WARNING. THAT WILL STOP THE CLOCK, AND THEY'LL PRESERVE THEIR THREE TIMEOUTS. PATRIOTS OVERCOMING A 10POINT DEFICIT. AGAIN, WE GO BACK TO BRADY TELLING US YESTERDAY, \"THERE WOULD NOT BE A GAME I WOULD WANT TO WIN MORE THAN THIS ONE.\" LYNCH GETS FLANKED OUT. EMPTY BACKFIELD. WILSON. DOWN THE SIDELINE. LYNCH MAKES THE CATCH! AND HE'LL GET TACKLED BY JAMIE COLLINS. BUT THAT'S A BIG GAIN, TAKING US TO THE 2MINUTE WARNING. THEY STILL HAVE THEIR THREE TIMEOUTS. &gt;&gt; WHAT A CALL THAT WAS BY DARRELL BEVELL. RUSSELL WILSON SAW MARSHAWN LYNCH ONEONONE AGAINST THE LINEBACKER, JAMIE COLLINS. SLANT AND GO. TO A RUNNING BACK. THAT IS CONFIDENCE IN THE ABILITY OF NOT JUST RUSSELL WILSON, BUT MARSHAWN LYNCH. AND A TRUST WITH THE SEASON ON THE LINE. BRILLIANT CALL. BRILLIANT THROW. AND NOW THEY'RE AT MIDFIELD. COULD THIS GAME BE ANY BETTER? &gt;&gt; MMMMMMM. PLENTY LEFT, TOO. 1:55. THAT WAS LYNCH'S FIRST CATCH OF THE GAME. THEY BLITZ. WILSON FIRES. AND THAT'S INCOMPLETE. INTENDED FOR KEARSE. LOOKS AROUND FOR A FLAG. GETS NONE. MALCOLM BUTLER, THE ROOKIE OUT OF WEST ALABAMA, A FREE AGENT, WITH THE DEFENSE. &gt;&gt; CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THIS ROOKIE IS THINKING? AND HE COULD NOT HAVE PLAYED THIS BETTER. PERFECT POSITION. GOING TO COME, JUMP INSIDE, KNOCK IT AWAY. BRILLIANT PLAY. &gt;&gt; MMMMM. FROM THE 49. SECOND AND 10. PLAY CLOCK AT :01. AND NOW WILSON HAS TO TAKE A TIMEOUT. SO THEY HAVE THREE, SO HE TAKES ONE HERE. PLAY CLOCK WAS ALL THE WAY DOWN. &gt;&gt; FIRST CHARGED TIMEOUT, SEATTLE. 30SECOND TIMEOUT. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING? CHRIS MATTHEWS, WHO'S HAD THE UNBELIEVABLE GAME, BECAUSE TEAMS WORK ON PACKAGES OF PLAYS, AND SO WHEN YOU GET IN THE 2MINUTE OFFENSE, THEY'VE PRACTICED WITH THE GUYS THAT THEY HAVE IN THERE BALDWIN AND LOCKETTE AND KEARSE. AND SO HE HASN'T BEEN A PART OF THIS. AND YET IF YOU'VE WATCHED THE GAME, YOU KNOW HE'S THE ONE THAT SORT OF BROKE IT OPEN. &gt;&gt; SURE. NOW HE'S COMING IN. HE'LL BE A PART OF THIS NEXT PLAY HERE ON SECOND DOWN AND 10. MATTHEWS HAS CAUGHT 4 FOR 109 YARDS AND A TOUCHDOWN. SECOND AND 10. TWO TIMEOUTS NOW LEFT FOR THE SEAHAWKS. KEY GUYS ON THE FIELD. WILLSON, THE TIGHT END, HAS NOT CAUGHT A PASS IN THIS GAME. DEEP DROP. TON OF TIME. GOING FOR IT ALL. KNOCKED AWAY. BROWNER IS BACK THERE. THERE WAS MATTHEWS. AND BRANDON BROWNER, WHO WAS A SEAHAWK LAST YEAR BUT WAS SUSPENDED AT THE END OF THE SEASON AND HAD TO WATCH THE SUPER BOWL HAS A RING AND THEN LEFT FOR NEW ENGLAND IN FREE AGENCY. &gt;&gt; GONNA GO RIGHT UP THE SEAM HERE. THE PATRIOTS CAME WITH A THREEMAN RUSH. AND THEY MADE THIS SWITCH EARLY. AND I THINK, FOR MATT PATRICIA, IT'S BEEN A GOOD ONE. THE JUMP BALLS, NOW THAT YOU HAVE A 6'4\" CORNERBACK, ARE A LITTLE MORE FAIR, LITTLE MORE FAVORABLE FOR THE PATRIOTS. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 10. FLANK LYNCH AGAIN. WILSON. HANGS IN THERE. THROWS. THAT'S CAUGHT. THAT'S GOING TO BE A FIRST DOWN. 38YARD LINE. RICARDO LOCKETTE. AND NOW THEY'LL HUSTLE UP TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, PRESERVING THE TIMEOUTS. UNDER 1:30 TO GO. &gt;&gt; WE'VE SEEN WHEN LOGAN RYAN HAS BEEN IN THE GAME THE PLAY RIGHT BEFORE THE HALF AND NOW THEY'RE COMING BACK TO HIM. LOCKETTE IS A GUY WITH BRILLIANT SPEED, SO RYAN HAS TO BE CAREFUL. &gt;&gt; RUSSELL IN THE POCKET. RUSSELL FOR KEARSE, AND IT'S BROKEN UP AGAIN. AND IS IT BUT SOMEHOW... &gt;&gt; HOLY COW. &gt;&gt; DID HE WIND UP WITH THE FOOTBALL? &gt;&gt; I THINK BUTLER HIT IT AND IT FELL RIGHT BACK DOWN TO THE GROUND. UNBELIEVABLE! THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED, ISN'T IT? &gt;&gt; WELL, KEARSE GOES FOR IT. IT'S STILL NOT ON THE GROUND. IT'S STILL WHOA, LOOK AT THAT. PHENOMENAL. &gt;&gt; I CAN'T BELIEVE HE DIDN'T GET UP AND GET IN THE END ZONE IN TIME. &gt;&gt; AND THEN BUTLER TAKES HIM OUT. SO HE BREAKS UP THE PLAY, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY LOOK AT THAT. DOES A JUGGLING ACT. HAS IT AT THE 5. FIRST AND GOAL. 33 YARDS. AND NOW, BY THE TIME THEY GET DOWN THERE, THE PLAY CLOCK HAS RUN OUT AGAIN. &gt;&gt; SECOND CHARGED TIMEOUT. &gt;&gt; AND SEATTLE TAKES A TIMEOUT. CRAZY! &gt;&gt; HOW MANY DIFFERENT PLAYS ARE THE PATRIOTS GOING TO HAVE LIKE THIS? MARIO MANNINGHAM, DAVID TYREE. AND NOW KEARSE. &gt;&gt; THIS WAS WHERE TYREE HAD THE HELMET CATCH. THIS WAS THE SCENE OF THE CRIME FOR NEW ENGLAND. &gt;&gt; AND TOM BRADY HAD THAT LOOK ON HIS FACE LIKE, \"YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. NOT AGAIN.\" &gt;&gt; HERE YOU GO BACK TO SUPER BOWL XLII. TYREE MAKES THE CATCH. OUR BUDDY RODNEY HARRISON HAD A BIRD'SEYE VIEW. PLAXICO BURRESS WINDS UP WITH THE TOUCHDOWN TO WIN THE GAME AND END WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A PERFECT SEASON FOR THE PATRIOTS. THEY WERE 180 COMING IN. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, AL, YOU PLAY 16 GAMES, COUPLE OF PLAYOFF GAMES, AND IT COMES DOWN TO ONE TIPPED BALL THAT FALLS ON THE GROUND TO SOMEBODY WHO'S LYING ON HIS BACK. [ BOTH LAUGH ] &gt;&gt; PAUL ALLEN HAS SEEN IT ALL, BUT NOT THAT. LOOK AT THAT. &gt;&gt; BUT THEY'RE NOT IN YET. &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S DURON HARMON, WHO COMES OVER THE TOP. HE HAD A CHANCE TO MAYBE KICK IT AWAY. KEARSE COMES UP WITH IT. AMAZING. THE BALL AT THE 5. &gt;&gt; NOW YOU HAVE TO STOP MARSHAWN LYNCH. &gt;&gt; HERE HE GOES. BEAST MODE. TO THE HALFYARD LINE. AND NOW NEW ENGLAND HAS TO THINK ABOUT TAKING A TIMEOUT. &gt;&gt; BOY, THE LAST TIME WE CALLED A SUPER BOWL, AL, REMEMBER? &gt;&gt; AHMAD BRADSHAW. &gt;&gt; DO YOU LET THEM SCORE? DO YOU PUT THE BALL BACK IN THE HANDS OF TOM BRADY? AND I GUARANTEE YOU BILL BELICHICK IS SITTING HERE THINKING ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; IT'S ON HIS MIND. IT HAS TO BE. DO YOU BLEED THE CLOCK ALL THE WAY DOWN? THEY'RE BLEEDING IT RIGHT DOWN TO HALF A MINUTE. SECOND AND GOAL. BALDWIN SETS UP ON THE LEFT. PLAY CLOCK AT :05. PASS IS INTERCEPTED AT THE GOAL LINE BY MALCOLM BUTLER! UNREAL! MALCOLM BUTLER, WHO ALMOST MADE THE PHENOMENAL PLAY THAT WOUND UP IN KEARSE'S ARMS. THERE ARE FLAGS ON THE FIELD FOR CELEBRATION. AMAZING! BUTLER, A ROOKIE FREE AGENT OUT OF WEST ALABAMA. &gt;&gt; THEY TRIED A PICK PLAY, AL. THEY TRIED TO GO HERE, BUT HE BEATS HIM TO THE PUNCH. AND I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE THE CALL. &gt;&gt; ME NEITHER. &gt;&gt; I CANNOT BELIEVE THE CALL. YOU'VE GOT MARSHAWN LYNCH IN THE BACKFIELD. YOU'VE GOT A GUY THAT'S BEEN BORDERLINE UNSTOPPABLE IN THIS PART OF THE FIELD. I CAN'T BELIEVE THE CALL. &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S BRADY. AS DEMONSTRATIVE AS EVER. AND RICHARD SHERMAN GOING, \"WHAT?\" I AGREE WITH YOU. WHY MAKE THAT CALL? YOU'RE DOWN ON THE HALFYARD LINE. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT AGAINST THE NEW ENGLAND BENCH AFTER THE INTERCEPTION. THE PENALTY WILL BE HALF THE DISTANCE TO THE GOAL. NEW ENGLAND KEEPS THE BALL. FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; WELL, IT'S HALF THE DISTANCE TO THE GOAL, WHICH IS NEXT TO NOTHING. AND NOW SEATTLE HAD TO USE TWO TIMEOUTS, SO THEY CAN ONLY STOP THE CLOCK ONCE. AND BARRING COMPLETE INSANITY AND I MEAN COMPLETE... &gt;&gt; I DON'T BELIEVE IT. &gt;&gt; ...IT'S GOING TO BE A WIN FOR THE PATRIOTS. &gt;&gt; I I'M SITTING HERE, AND I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT BELIEVE THAT PLAY CALL. IF I LOSE THE SUPER BOWL BECAUSE MARSHAWN LYNCH CAN'T GET IT IN FROM THE 1YARD LINE, SO BE IT. SO BE IT. BUT THERE IS NO WAY... III DON'T BELIEVE THE CALL. YOU KNOW, YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT IT, YOU THINK YOU UNDERSTAND. OTHER TEAM PRACTICES, TOO. [ SIGHS ] &gt;&gt; SO, NOW, BARRING A FUMBLED SNAP WELL, LET'S SEE. BRADY'S GOT TO BE ABLE TO GET THE BALL OUT OF THE END ZONE. OTHERWISE, IT WOULD BE 2 POINTS AND THEY'D HAVE TO HAVE A FREE KICK FROM THE 20. THAT'S SEATTLE'S FIRST TURNOVER OF THE GAME. &gt;&gt; SECOND CHARGED TIMEOUT, NEW ENGLAND. &gt;&gt; FIGURE OUT A WAY WELL, BRADY'S SO GOOD AT THE SNEAK. JUST TAKE IT AND START PLOWING FORWARD. JUST MAKE SURE YOU DON'T WIND UP WITH THE BALL IN THE END ZONE. &gt;&gt; SO YOU GOT THE PICK PLAY, ALL RIGHT? YOU KNOW, YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE IT, YOU THINK BUT WHY? I YOU KNOW, HOW ABOUT MALCOLM BUTLER? GIVES UP THE FLUKE PLAY DOWN THE FIELD. LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOING TO BE PARTLY RESPONSIBLE. AND MAKES AN INCREDIBLE PLAY. YOU GOT TO GET IT OUT OF HERE, THOUGH. AND BELICHICK WILL SAY, \"MAKE SURE THESE GUYS FIRE OFF.\" LOOK AT EVERYBODY INSIDE. OH, MY GOODNESS. &gt;&gt; OF ALL THINGS, IF THEY JUMPED OFF AND WEREN'T DRAWN, THAT WILL TAKE THEM TO THE 6YARD LINE. THE OFFICIALS WILL CONFER. &gt;&gt; MICHAEL BENNETT JUMPS OFFSIDES MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE. 10 TIMES THIS YEAR. AND IN THIS CRITICAL, LASTCHANCE MOMENT, HE DOES AGAIN. &gt;&gt; UNLESS HE WAS DRAWN. &gt;&gt; ENCROACHMENT. &gt;&gt; AND HE WASN'T. &gt;&gt; DEFENSE, NUMBER 72. 5YARD PENALTY. STILL FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; GIVE BRADY CREDIT. HE JUST DREW HIM. THEY WERE GOING TOTAL SCRUM IN BEHIND. AND BILL BELICHICK KNOWS, AFTER ALL THE HEARTBREAK. WE SAW IT, AL. TYREE, MARIO MANNINGHAM, FLUKY PLAYS. THIS TIME, AFTER ALL THE STUFF OF THESE TWO WEEKS... &gt;&gt; AND THEN A SCRUM, OF COURSE. HERE YOU GO. FLAGS. SO YOU'LL HAVE AN UGLY ENDING TO WHAT WAS A PRETTY TERRIFIC BALL GAME. WELL, A LOT OF FRUSTRATION OUT THERE FOR THE GUYS IN BLUE. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, FROM SEATTLE'S STANDPOINT... WHATEVER. FROM NEW ENGLAND'S STANDPOINT, YOU'RE 18 SECONDS AWAY FROM A SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP. YOU DON'T THROW A PUNCH AT ANYBODY HERE. GRONKOWSKI TAKES A SHOT FROM BENNETT, WHO I'M SURE IS FRUSTRATED. THEN GRONKOWSKI THROWS ONE BACK, AND HERE WE GO. [ LAUGHS ] EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE IN THE NFL, YOU THINK YOU'VE SEEN IT ALL. &gt;&gt; NO, YOU HAVEN'T. &gt;&gt; I WILL NEVER GET OVER THROWING THE BALL IN THAT SITUATION. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND FINAL TIMEOUT, SEATTLE. &gt;&gt; NEITHER WILL SEAHAWK FANS. &gt;&gt; AFTER THE PLAY, PERSONAL FOUL, UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS. INSTIGATOR, NUMBER 51, HAS BEEN EJECTED. 15YARD PENALTY. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; THAT IS BRUCE IRVIN. MEANWHILE, THINK ABOUT BUTLER. THIS KID IS A FREE AGENT. PLAYED AT A SMALLER SCHOOL. HE'S FROM VICKSBURG, MISSISSIPPI. PLAYED AT WEST ALABAMA. PATS SIGNED HIM LAST MAY. TRANSFERRED FROM HINDS, MISSISSIPPI, COMMUNITY COLLEGE. SUPER BOWL HERO. &gt;&gt; AND, AL, YOU COULD TELL HE HAD DONE HIS HOMEWORK. HE SAW THE PICK PLAY COMING. THE MINUTE HIS RECEIVER CAME INSIDE, HE FIRED. IF THERE WAS ANYTHING ELSE ON, HE WASN'T GONNA GET THERE. HE WAS GONNA GIVE UP THE GAMEWINNING TOUCHDOWN. BUT HE DID HIS HOMEWORK AND HE FIRED HIS SHOT AND MADE THE PLAY OF THE YEAR. &gt;&gt; SO THE PATRIOTS ON THE CUSP OF MAKING IT FOUR IN THE 21st CENTURY. BELICHICK'S ALREADY TAKEN THE SHOWER. HIS TEAM DOWN BY 10... IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. BOB KRAFT AND JONATHAN KRAFT ARE ALREADY DOWN THERE. AND ONE KNEELDOWN SHOULD END THE GAME. WHAT A JOURNEY. THE SKY WAS FALLING IN EARLY OCTOBER. THERE'S A LOT OF BRIGHT SUNSHINE RIGHT NOW IN FOXBOROUGH AND ALL OVER NEW ENGLAND. AND AFTER THE WACKIEST LEADUP TO A SUPER BOWL EVER, THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS ARE THE NFL CHAMPIONS. &gt;&gt; GREAT GAME. &gt;&gt; GIVE THEM ROOM, GUYS. GIVE THEM ROOM.",

  "transcript": "temperature here in Foxboro 58 degrees cloudy skies it has rained on and off in the morning into the early afternoon let's bring in the third member of our broadcast crew that was Kevin Washburn hi and in recent years this rivalry has provided some great finishes and often equally as entertaining has been the trash talk leading up to game day often coming from the Jets and former coach Rex Ryan will undertone goals a completely different situation his message to his team this week was ignore the noise if you think of this game as the biggest game of the year we are not going to play well do not get out of character think of this as game 6 guys as we saw and heard last night it seems like they bought in no doubt about it haven't Patriots week a little different under Bulls compared to Rex Ryan New England won the toss they have deferred to the second half so Stephen Gostkowski will kick it off Chris O who sues back from a knee injury is the return man the fourthyear wide out from Stanford chants have already equalled their head level season for throwing on the Patriots remain undefeated and they kicked off codes to the back of the end zone the Jets will have it at the 20 yard line to open things up Ryan Fitzpatrick last week 34 to 20 win over Washington Fitzpatrick was sharp two touchdowns through the air and one on the ground eight told us last night the Jets are brimming with confidence because running back Chris Ivory and that Jets d are playing lights out today he knows it's just critical for the Jets to score touchdowns not have to settle for field goals he's well aware of the potency of the Patriot offense led by Brady Jets are four and one for the first time since 2010 that season they started five and one and went 115 and beat the Patriots in the divisional round of the AFC playoffs nature areas come going out first place in scrimmage Fitzpatrick got again we're trying to get to the outside and he is pushed down Jamie Collins leading the charge for New England he has been all everything for the past offensively this season James Carpenter part of that offensive line for New York Todd Bowles called him the most underrated signing that the Jets made during the offseason with a lot of bigname Sonic's Eric Decker five straight games with a touchdown for Decker leading this include jet offense Glossop poor on the play Alicia was in as a third receiver Quincy he knew Yossef ended four games for violating the league's personal conduct policy a domestic incident for a noon one serving his first game Patrick loses the football and it's controlled by New England Dante Hightower on the recovery and an early call for New York yeah just a horrible start for the Jets offense a lose three yards on first down when Irish trapped in the backfield and now Fitzpatrick trying to find a running Lane out of the pocket here is going to get hit by right at the bottom of the screen there it looked like it was Chandler Jones the ball bounces forward right into the arms of Hightower here's Jones working against Ferguson and in both him and Collins converging on Fitzpatrick just a terrible start for the Jets this season the Jets have turned it over seven times in the first half that's tied for the most of the NFL with Houston and New England opens up a side the chance 20 James White is out there replacing Dion Lewis on first day for Brady and the Pats working out of the gun Brady protection is falling apart and Brady forced to get rid of it at the feet of Edelman pressure coming from Mohammed Wilkerson for the Jets Tom Brady has set a new club record his 213th career start that's the most in franchise history passing Bruce Armstrong and because that offensive line is in constant flux because the injury communication is vital for Brady of them and it's not just him talking to them they want he wants to hear them talking to that way he knows they've got the calls any adjustments he may have to take more time at the line of scrimmage than usual on a second and 10 Gronkowski and a modest game 5 yards on second down setting up third down for New England that way they shouldn't Davis they are defensively and with the matrix in the red zone you're going to see Revis on Gronkowski when Gronkowski splits out wide Burton 5 now for New England busters screen is in the Nickelback for New York they go empty and spread it with five on a third and five for any puck lady goes down at the 20 it's Mahama to Wilkerson leading this front 7 for New York now let's check out Ferguson number 96 right here working against Cameron Fleming it's going to get inside and pick up another sack 5 sacks now on the season for Ferguson Mohammad Wilkerson rather and that's a great defensive stand after the turnover for the Jets defense but what else do you expect out of this jet defense 38 yard attempt for Stephen Gostkowski 21 straight makes and he knocks it through to put New England in front the Patriots take advantage of the turnover and they settle for three Danny Amendola got to be careful patrolling that area the board's exchanged early fumble on the second play from scrimmage for Ryan Fitzpatrick that opened the door for the New England offense so the defense gets a win for New England causing the fumble and the recovery but then the Jets defense gets a win for stopping New England deep in New York territory and Fitzpatrick has only been sacked twice all year sacked on that play and that was his second fumble but just the first one in he's lost credit for the shot goes to Chandler Jones on the street whoo sue takes a knee and the Jets will have it at the 20yard line they trail three nothing early in this opening quarter now Todd Bowles he has seen his team come out flat in a number of games here's the difference you can come out flat against Washington a week ago now you come up flat against New England in the first half and you could find yourself down 20 to nothing on the scoreboard there's no question about that and this is a game you wouldn't expect it just to come out flat offensively but listen for on first down then the fumble on second down terrible started Zacks Tennessee is in the backfield for New York it's a bootleg catastrophe with a flip they get the tight end involved Cumberland with the catch just his third catch of the season Jeff Cumberland 16 yards on the catch and run defensively for New England expect to see more Malcom Brown today Silver's see linga will be rotated in and out and that alignment Jonathan free knee stepping in Jerrod Mayo less snaps for him and Malcom Butler big challenge today going against deep play Brandon Marshall and his six foot four inch frame get it up to Stacey and he's wrapped up no gain on the play no Bilal Powell today's out with an ankle injury and there were some speculation that Steven Ridley would come off the physically unable to perform list to go against his former team but the Jets deem that he was not quite ready so Ridley not part of the active roster it's Patrick kid knows the Jets well as playing him a number of times when he isn't blesseth to the Buffalo Bills he says they have a Rolodex of coverages but he does expect random arson we doubled most of the day it's a second and 10 now for the Jets across the 35 Nikola 4,000,000 Justin Coleman in Fitzpatrick was coming thought that's not the way tried to get it over Ning kovitch on a loft Nick Nick pitch is only six but Fitzpatrick he's six as well so he's not going to be able to get this ball over the top of number 50 there as an Enka bitch comes off the block of Joc Damini and Fitzpatrick takes a big hit from Allen Branch and play had some done Bohen and had blockers out in front now it sets up a tough third and long or Fitzpatrick devin Smith the whoopi at Ohio State as before to receiver for the Jets Jordan Richards is the sixth defensive back for New England play clock is down to one they get the playoffs from the gun Fitzpatrick in stride he hits Eric Decker and it's a first down into New England territory quiets the crowd he's brought down at the 40th to 24 yard hook up without a single coverage against a Malcom Butler on the crossing route and Decker is so good at these type of play right here with a stiff arm right to the facemask of Richards that conversion there all the way into a patriot territory at the 44 yards last week that they've had a fumble of Cheops but he cut not a touchdown four catches 59 yards against Washington new set of downs for New York to work with which expansion sets in fires deep ball a rainbow incomplete Decker the intended receiver and I'm matching up against Malcolm Butler Butler riding strata just running stride for stride with Decker he sees this ball in the air right about now watch the lunge by Butler with the right hand just enough to knock it away from Decker tremendous athletic play by Malcolm Butler see how the ball changes its rotation there that means he got a couple of fingertips on that one and then no Chris Ivory on this possession we wonder he took a shot on that first play from scrimmage he did not look good on that first play from scrimmage near second and 10 Pete white defensive knocked down again it's ninja Mitch all over the field Allen branched the pressure and that combination is giving the chips Fitz early on Nick Savage has five career interceptions number 50 there as Bohannon lets him go after it's a screen pass that he got both hands on that pass liquors ivory is jogging in place but it's been Zac Stacy near the backfield at his possession for New York third and ten for receiver set Fitzpatrick steps up heat gun jet complete for a first out across the 30 feeding the football to Decker once again that one covers 12 yards now he's 6 3 to 15 and with a big body here against Butler who's just 511 190 watch how he posts him up here shields him with his body ball right on target another first down for the Jets good bounce back drive here for Fitzpatrick Decker heads to the Jets I love Jets on the move as we hit the tenminute mark on the first quarter doing little leading three nothing Russian man is elusive the to Stacey Zac Stacy carries some defenders with him for a four yard pickup Stacey came over in a deal with st. Louis good inside runner required for a seventh round draft pick a solid receiver but doesn't have the skillset of a Chris Ivory who's currently leading the NFL in rushing yards per game but he's another one of those shorter guys I am that at five nine but he packs 224 pounds into that five nine why did you stare it baby when you SEC shorter guys just trying to relate pal no no offense trying to make a human connection second at seven now Marshall these big receivers now are taking control on this drive that ball thrown right over the top Marshall defended by logan ryan again ryan 5:11 Marshall he goes at about six foot four and when you reach up high like that watch him keep the ball away from Ryan great awareness Marshall who has had some fumble troubles this year three is one of those a bat lateral so Jets now by tenth play of this Drive the trance of tiny rock to the end zone it's over the head of dicker Malcolm Butler their stride for stride with Decker it's obvious that Chan Gailey likes his mismatched size wise on the outside with Decker and Marshall that ball just thrown away by Fitzpatrick because that time Butler had good inside position on the receiver Jiang Kelly first year as the offensive coordinator for the Jets former head coach with Dallas and Buffalo and that chemistry goes back to his bills days with Ryan Fitzpatrick it's a second intent for New York 8:46 to go on the first take the running play the classroom then a cut fake looking for an angle and Fitzpatrick is out of bounds Jamie Collins veering over the limit Fitzpatrick to a three yard named Brian Fitzpatrick had an 18yard touchdown run last week that was the longest touchdown run for a Jets quarterback since Richard Todd in 1980 they said 20 carries on the year we had a flag down I lose the hands hands at the face deep fest number 22 fiveyard penalty for the other one or nothing hands to the face Joseph Fitzpatrick converts for the first down and then they get extra yardage across the field that right hand to the face mask of Chris elusive not only happened 40 or 45 yards away from Clare Fitzpatrick was running Jets are now inside the five Jets have been efficient in the red zone 12 play of the drive it's a lot easier in the red zone when you're working it inside the five as well and we've got a power runner like ivory who has not been in for this possession it's Stacy Zac Stacy puts the helmet down and picks up a couple and then you know the Patriots they have to be aware of Fitzpatrick on the bootleg or even on the quarterback draw average in 4.2 yards at carry as a quarterback Matt Patricia fourth year as the defensive coordinator of the Pats his 12th year with the organization and he's got the best set of number two pencils in the league and a fine fine beer that is topnotch they go looking to be now making a connection wait a second and goal for New York in the Patrick quick hitter up for grabs incomplete try to squeeze it into a loose ooh yes when the best shot at list Ning kovitch on the rebound watch the slant route to the right side of the screen one step and fire and there's an Inca pitch with his hands on it again the job comforts that time by Justin Coleman does that Russell Wilson throwing it I would have given it to Marshawn Lynch I don't know about you even here yes even if he's not on the team let's put that to bed that in the emails and go jetzt trying to take the lead out of the gun fitzpatrick laughs sit tight Merriman juggle and it's incomplete and I'll match you up with Patrick Chung and the Jets unable to cash in on third and goal Chung does a great job of he's not looking for the ball what he's looking for is he's waiting for Cumberland to reach for the ball and when Cumberland reaches for the ball Chung goes right between his hands tremendous play by Patrick Chung watch him strip that right arm down and knock the ball out it is a 20 yard field goal attempt for Nick folk Steve Weatherford who was signed yesterday as the punter ryan Quigley a shin injury so whether for not only funny but holding the 10year veteran puts it down and knocks it through 15 play drive to tie this game at three apiece this close to a touchdown to the Jets Chung makes the play on the tight end Cumberland the NFL on CBS is sponsored by Southwest transparency low fares nothing too high McDonald's now serving allday breakfast and by Kelly Blue Book find out what you should pay for your next new car at kbb.com injury update let's go down to the field evan Washburn well guys Chris Ivory no injury to report I did not see him with out of athletic trainers or doctors now he was trying to stay as loose as possible he's currently on the bike right now but during that entire possession had his helmet on chinstrap buckled he wanted to go in it look like he was staying there prepared I'll update you if I hear anything but nothing official as of yet all right Evan thanks it just looked a little awkward as ivory took the handoff on that first play the Jets called of the day and he ended up losing four yards normally you see ivory lower his head and try to drive forward regardless of how many defenders are around him but he just really kind of collapsed as the tackles were coming we'll fix it off Patrick Chung here's the return man it goes right through his hands now to keep it in the end zone and it will be a touchback out to the 20 chung avoids a near disaster tom barrini he has won 58 of his last 62 home games locked in at Gillette Stadium now Patrick Chung is going to buff his chance at a return here and it's almost turns into a disaster as the ball will touch the goal line but the ball has to go entirely across the goal line in order to be parked outside of the end zone that so it's a touch back but Patrick Chung lucky there the ball stayed where it did he doesn't have a lot of experience as a kick returner 2014 the average 20 yards a return with a long of 30 that's it in his career no other year was he a featured kick returner Patriots take over first and ten at the 20 yard line motion man is Edelman titan3 slingbacks james white spin move they had to wide his head across the 25 again white stepping in for Dion Lewis out with a nav injury with NFL mobile watch local and primetime NFL games live on your smartphone learn more at nfl.com / mobile 5 receiver set white sets up as a receiver second and three Brady to Edelman first down for New England just across the 35 brought down by Demario Davis the leading tackler on the Jets and Brady will take this mismatch any day Edelman on a linebacker a short crossing route and you can see Davis in the trail position there first down pats two tight ends in this formation around Kowski and Michael Williams the former Lion 1st and 10 at 36 but he Pat's the ball crosses out and took Gronkowski and he's drilled right away by Gilchrist Marcus Gilchrist came over as a free agent from San Diego he's really fit into what Todd Bowles was looking to do with that secondary it's a oneyard pick up ground only had three catches last week and it's his first of the day for half a yard maybe Paul said he was looking for versatility and Gilchrist could cover he's a full quarterback and a nickel he's tough smart and Kentucky grading incomplete white the intended target with Calvin pace there at its third and nine for the Pats but again Brady finding the proper mismatches according to the gameplan of Josh McDaniels that is running back white on the linebacker pace and as a drop pass his 15th year with the Patriots former head coach of the Broncos in the nine nine and ten waiting underneath Hetal many tries to break a tackle and will come up well short of the first down David Harris along with Demario Davis made sure he didn't get to the marker it's a fiveyard pickup and it's fourth down for New England and the decision is to go for it on fourth down it's fourth and four they've just one out of four this season converting fourth down opportunities now that punt team comes out the third down the Patriots are best in the league at converting at 50% but that's because they usually have a third and five or less that time was third and nine and they couldn't pick it up and the Jets get their return man Curley onto the field play clock is down to two Ryan Allen the corner to pressure Kerli fair catch called sore brings it in cleanly and the Jets will get the football back after the 41yard punt from allen we're tied at three first quarter action continues with Foxborough back here at Gillette Stadium and back on the field is Chris Ivory just had the one carry on the first play for the Jets lost four yards then we saw Zac Stacy in on the next possession for New York I've identified in stutter steps thrown backwards by Hightower making a statement against the top ivory fuller progress will get him three yards on his first carry loses four yards and you can see how he slows down almost as if he heard the whistle blow or something and gets dropped for a four yard loss and that time it looked like he had a little bit more going there but a good tackle and throw back by Hightower ivorie had 146 yards on the ground last week the first Jets running back since Freeman McNeil to lust 140 plus yards and backtoback games I was back in 1985 play action potential America Russia terrific job by Fitzpatrick getting out of the pocket getting to the perimeter for a gain of 11 Dante hi teller put the heat now gain of 11 that time for Fitzpatrick smart runner and faster than you think look how he outruns Hightower Hightower just gives up as he sees the sidelines coming up and Fitzpatrick converts to another first down for the Jets we asked him about going up against Belichick he said they're constantly mixing it up they move guys around interchangeable parts on defense he said they're not that complicated black they also don't have a lot of tended to see that we can pick up a trick deflect it a mess picked off Decker had a chance at it Ning kovitch again with another tip ball and that's the third deflection in this first quarter for New England's defense and that's really a puzzling to Fitzpatrick and frustrating watch Ning kovitch here as he's going to read the eyes of Fitzpatrick gets in the throwing Lane Decker almost can't pull it in with one hand but Fitzpatrick now 0 for his last four because of the play of Nick of it it's a second and 10 for New York three four minutes remaining in the first apology ryan fitzpatrick gets it done for New York avoiding the rush of Hicks looping around and finding the open fullback now let's check out Hicks I mean he comes clear free on the quarterback here as he beats a doubleteam Jack kamini lets him go and Oh lay there Chandler Jones can't make the catch and then always looking downfield as Jamie Collins was approaching finds Bohannon first catch of the year for Tommy ball had the 30th pulled back from the Wake Forest first down projects give it up takes the opening turns it into a three yard game NFL today update JB Mark Scott in New York interim coach Dan Campbell has the Dolphins flying high oh yeah he continues to to inspire right here you're going to see Jarvis Landrieu take the catch take it all the way across the field remember he's a is a tremendous punt returners Ryan Tannehill six of six on the day 127 yards Miami up 14zip bat in the first quarter high an eagle Dan Fouts and Evan Washburn the soup is sidered van campbell on a second and seven I do battles inside and takes it to the forty that's a three yard gain for toughminded Chris Ivory Jamie Collins in on the stop we asked ivory what do you like what do you like to run he said I like the inside zone and I like power and going right he feels very comfortable with this offensive line he's dominant on his right side so you guys all clip that one foot in the ground and get upfield ivory likes to push off his right leg and use that power they bring Zach Stacy in on third down full receiver set curly and elusive play clock is down the two shotgun kotecha the protective put Patrick time took Decker first down for New York 17 yards Ryan Fitzpatrick blows it up to Eric Decker well Collins is going to come on the Blitz and he's not going to get there and Decker's just having a whale of a first quarter here three catches now for 52 yards and another first down and another impressive drive for the Jets after that disastrous start in two plays that it's Patrick fumble but odd but boy what a comeback he has made he has had six targets so far he's now on the sidelines Brandon Marshall operating out of the slot ivory is back Mir on a first intent he pled detention sucks the feet nobody home he bounced it in the area of Owusu he knew that pressure was coming he felt Dante Hightower coming free and instead of taking a sack that would take them out of field goal range decide to throw that one in the dirt in front of elusive Brian Fitzpatrick seven career games against New England prior to this one going against Bill Belichick 13 touchdown seven to nine interceptions his team rhiannon six in those games on a second and 10 ivory new ivory can't break free of Hightower Dante Hightower returning to the lineup he missed the Colts game with a rib injury and he's had an impact in his opening quarter no game and I tower very active here and see it again is meeting ivory and not giving ivory anything after contact Tom Moretti has done a lot of warming up on the sidelines for the England how about the Jets play selection 15 passes against ten runs second straight doubledigit drive for the Jets as of their tenth play of the possession on a third intent to Patrick underneath they sent a pic for Tory and Jim accelerates curly has enough for the first down time winding down in this opening quarter that play covers 12 yards curly just his seventh gram of the season how about four four five converting third downs to keep these long drives alive for New York end of the first quarter with the Jets and the Patriots tied at three we'll return the Foxborough after these messages you're watching the NFL on CBS home of Super Bowl 50 start of the second quarter here in Foxborough on an eagle Dan Fouts have been washed for the rest of our NFL on CBS crew time of possession just on this drive five minutes and five seconds in the first quarter New England had the football for three minutes and 46 seconds 241 yards of offense for the Jets 21 for the Pats and eight plays run for New England yeah who would have guessed that huh for this game that the Pats would be sitting on 21 yards the defense of the Jets holding serve but how about the offense of the Jets so far to number one rushing attack in the NFL number eight in total offense and a first to carry just inside the 12 Oh like screw it and we'll gain two twoandahalf on the play well on third and ten you called it was definitely a pick play watch Decker here he's going to go out here and search out the defensive back allowing Curley to get underneath but if this isn't a pick I don't know what is he goes out just blocks a defender Curley picks up 12 yards I mean Butler had notes rather Chung had no chance at taking Curley over the middle spot the football just inside the 10 ivorie sets up as a receiver motion man is curling on 2nd and 8th out of the pocket Fitzpatrick takes a shot from according Devin McCourty with the lick uh Fitzpatrick most would imagine when I was about here but he's thinking given the enzyme that amends on last week the pencil in from high tire then absorbs his big shot right in the back from the court I caught him on the shoulder as well right shoulder now a third and one for the Jets they can get it first down with get out getting a touchdown Charlie goes in motion Jets looking for the me in chat hand on either ear driving and chess short but he does have enough for the first down a tremendous leg drive and then help from his offensive line Hightower again is going to meet him at about the 2 yard line right about there but watch this surge by the offensive line John Khomeini's always good for a and assists there that's enough to pick up the first down jets bring in a sixth offensive line and it's rent quali first and goal for the Jets ships out of the backseat but that's what we'll take a timeout now wisely because they had two men and most in their Cumberland was not set as this Patrick is about to call for the snap so he smartly called timeout well the wait is over the world premiere of Supergirl is just one day away be sure to see what everyone will be talking about Supergirl it premieres tomorrow after a new Big Bang Theory only CBS flag came down they might have got me the penalty before the timeout was taken I think that's the conversation right now between Bill vinovich and Todd Bowles but what took the officials so long you're halfway into Super Girl that charger the timeout due to the penalty first down so it ends up backing the Jets up on the false start just outside the five first and goal when ad Patrick puts a pass he's got curling for the touchdown and the Jets take the lead early in the second quarter the second touchdown catch of the season and you wouldn't expect a fivefootnine receiver to be the primary down here in the goal line but he's gonna run a quick little slant route against Justin Coleman the rookie out of Tennessee about a 14play drive 83 yards seven and a half minutes on and they overcome the penalty from the goal line back to the five and Curley gets in the cloak is on for the extra point Tanner Pritam will snap at Weatherford is the holder and straight through for folk 10/3 advantage for the Jets another long drive this one culminates in a Jeremy Kerley touchdown craft Jeremy Kerley has been a bit of a forgotten man in this Chet's offense but curly a factor in this first half 14 plays on that drive for the Jets they had 15 plays on the previous drive so 29 plays last two drives for New York and a 103 lead at the 12:30 mark second quarter and Fitzpatrick has thrown 16 passes already Vulpix it off and Angola for eternity spun down just shy of the 25 no Chung on that return remember Chung but the ball go right off his hands on the first try of the day Tom Brady is getting restless Wow low block kicking team number 26 15yard penalty for the end of the run you need to keep the ball first down not if there has been one issue for the Jets early this season it has been special teams it's been spotty at times Brady just chomping at the bit to get out there New England's dominance here at one Patriot place last 50 home games 46 and for best winning percentage over a 50 game span at home in the Super Bowl era they haven't won enough plays to establish a rhythm yet on offense is no play so far in this first half this is the ninth operating play fake waiting room knocked away trying to get it to Gronkowski Calvin Pryor the third there for the slock down let's go back to the touchdown this alignment here by Coleman is designed to take away the inside slant route but the quickness of Curley a one small step to the outside and then speed and quickness to the inside gets him a touchdown the England came in hadn't scored its offensive possessions and they cannot get it going Brandon LaFell back on the team after being activated off the physically unable to perform list with a foot injury that's a drop and it's third and 10 for New England it was a drop that it was a poor throw by Brady to when Brady misses often it is low and right now he is not in a rhythm not able to hit Gronkowski on first down in the Borla fell on second out I mentioned the percentage of offensive possessions they've scored that leads the NFL in scoring efficiency and a big dropoff to number two Cincinnati 43% 13 percentage points below New England third and 10 short of a first down as he crossed the 45 that one covers seven yards and the punting unit will come on from Bill Belichick squad as we hit 12 minutes to play second quarter and defensive coordinator Casey Rodgers dialing up the safety blitz that time Calvin Pryor coming late in the face of Brady and forcing the hot throw it wasn't enough to bring up the first down Jeremy Kerley waiting for this punt at his own 10 yard line Ryan Allen computers much pressure high petronella curly rein and he brings it in at the seventh 47yard punt from Allen it's been a perplexing first half of rough trading one for Tom Brady under the wigglin offense the Patriots Hall of Fame well who's who's here do they go everywhere these two guys has traveled from Cleveland of Foxborough they watch those Jersey folks and while other clothes are the same charges I guess great so just take over after the punt from our that Stacy gets the call runs into Alan branch and picks up two and a half yards on forward progress now that they didn't start out too good for Fitzpatrick on second thought a game he stripped of the ball by Chandler Jones but he's bounced back been hurting five of six third downs and then also using his legs to keep the Patriots offbalance and again the slant route to Curley on a play by the rookie Justin Coleman you just can't have and to take away inside position is your alignment and then still letting the receiver inside Russia on Melvin is now in there in the secondary for Nevada Stacy he's got that running Lane he's brought down by Chung good block by Ferguson to spring him loose for seven NFL today update JB if Bart's got a jab and yeah Matt Ryan Tannehill is on fire not but now four to one he's gonna file the bar Miller who does the rest Ryan Tannehill on the day three touchdown for over 50 yards Miami is woken up 28 nothing and disabused white at the start of the second quarter iron and Dan is that the same team we saw in London a few weeks ago no I think the chowder is working in Miami trying to make things interesting in the AFC East this is a third and toukatachi too high it was over the head of Marshall he was dealing with some pressure in the pocket good defensive stand for the Patriots here Jamie Collins Jimmy Collins a most athletic defender that Matt Patricia has ever been able to to coach the pressure there by Chandler Jones as he takes the British off Ferguson back to the quarterback that's a deadly combo there Collins and Jones Steve Weatherford was hosting a radio show yesterday and now he is putting to the New York Jets and attention Iranian bounce Brian Quigley is out with a shin injury weatherford most recently with the New York Giants his second stint with the Jets that was just 31 yards for the 10year veteran on October 13th Patriot players made a special visit to the Dana Farber Cancer Institute at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston the players visited cancer patients and survivors surprising them with Patriots gifts and they invited ten survivors to a special day of pampering at Gillette Stadium join in the fight against breast cancer and find out how you can help make a little pet share this message with friends and loved ones at NFL comm slash cake we've got nine fifty to play in this first half Dan New England does not have a running play yet first repossessions they took over at the Jets 19 after the Fitzpatrick plum they settled for the field goal and then five plays three players they open up this possession a New York territory for the double tight end set grading plenty of time grading in complete rough fell low rust and he's going to beat Darrelle Revis to on this crossing route it's a good pass protection for Brady because this takes a while to get off but there's the sharp cut to the inside ball slightly thrown behind it but that's two drops now for LaFell policies in foot surgery for LaFell Revis there defensively former teammates Revis won a Super Bowl with the Patriots last season running play first one beloved too much there just across the 45 Sheldon Richardson in on the stop a threeyard pickup JB and Bart NFL today update everything going Miami way JV when it rains it pours Rashad Jones is going to get to deflect the catch intercepts and take it in for the score Miami is all over Houston 35 zero back to ironing right Dan Campbell Coach of the Year you have a vote I wish I did he'd get it they had in seven motion man Edelman where he gets rid of it which other news rookie attack 11 good cut by Amendola need to give New England a first down they had been ohforthree on third downs but if he doesn't make this great move as a crowd goes crazy for the first down from Menace move by Amendola Patriots moving quickly here we're down at the 45 to play in the first half Jets lead at 10 to 3 Brady with behind there's nobody there a pretty close pitch completed to Amendola now it was playaction pass with nobody to play action with Grady with a 360 here but he knows where to go with the boss slides to the left and finds Amendola in the seam Tom Brady has gone over fifty five thousand yards in his NFL career Gronkowski sets up as a receiver almost intercepted by Wilkerson Brady was locked in on Gronk when he had Gronk to it Wilkerson telling Brady he got away with one there what's the reaction here by number 96 is he doesn't even rush the passer Wilkerson getting in the passing lane and that's what Todd Bowles talked about not so much getting sacks the Jets only have eight on the year but they're very good at getting in the passing lane and getting some tip passes that lead to intercept these second down Patriots going empty again shotgun for Brady they trailed by a touchdown pump later enjoy too high James White is only five foot ten in a matchup with a linebacker Mario Davis but again we're seeing Brady finding the mismatches that he favors here at that time the coverage by Davis was really pretty good because he took away the inside and forced the throw high and wide to the fivefootten James White no Dion Lewis today out with an abdomen injury white stepping in for us white remains out there on a third and ten now for the Patriots Edelman in motion Brady each other ladies hit inside the five he's like a cheetah I think he surprised himself here a little bit I was gonna get to the line of scrimmage which is wise so the Jets can't substitute here but he's looking for the end zone here he's not looking to slide to the outside Kelvin fryer just saved their touchdown that's a fantastic play by prior looked like white had the corner to get to the pylon at least to dive for it for the tackle by Pryor number 25 skating along the defensive line there white can't get the stiff arm on him and he can't extend across the line second and goal for the Patriots we approach seven minutes to go first half blue England looking for the equalizer Pedro Kowski with plier there defensively and its third and goal now for New England it prior is a good matchup for Gronkowski because he's physical and he's got size at least in his weight about 210 pounds so he's not overpowered there by Gronkowski coming off the line of scrimmage the Brady really never gave Gronkowski a chance to make a leaping catch of that ball in the back of the end zone third and goal lady fires it toasty did it break the plane I thought he did it first look jets are claiming they stopped him before he got across the goal line running inside here it's one of those fake pic plays six ball never broke the plane this is where you gotta watch out for Grady and the quarterback snake here and Belichick is going for it of course on unfucked out tight formation played over the top he's a touchdown Patriots Tom Brady takes care of himself yeah he's so good and either going really low or using his 64 body to stretch across their reaches across breaks the plane 16 times now radius less for a touchdown in a 16year career he is one of the best ever to do that as a sneek runner and behind a rookie sinner in david andrews extra point Gostkowski it bans threw off the upright and we are tied at 10 Tom Brady had an 11 yard scramble to keep the drive going and the oneyard touchdown plunge that's the equalizer in the second quarter 11 plays 47 yards for the Patriots Brady the oneyard touchdown run and this game is tied at 10 with 624 to play first half in Foxborough kickoff from Gus Kowski I will sue is deep this will not be returned just 11 20 yard line right now Tom Brady is leading the Patriots in rushing and Ryan Fitzpatrick is leading the Jets in rushing you got a problem with that I got no problem with it well mobile quarterbacks did you ever lead the Chargers in rushing Dan excuse me hang on I'm buffering I'm at a buffer on this one check the record books no doubt don't worry about it Chris Ivery has been limited 7 carries 8 yards for ivory number 4 in the NFL in rushing over all behind Forte Fleeman and high entering action today from the guns at Patrick incomplete off to the side of Jeremy Kerley you know you go back to that last possession for the Jets the fine punt for the Patriots by Allen pin them deep in their own end and then Weatherford comes out with a 31 yarder giving the Patriots possession at the 47 yard line of New York so it was a short drive well executed by a gradient company but yet special teams hurting the tests last week Jets racked up a seasonhigh 474 yards against the Redskins they have a with 64 94 slapped it they against mundo ivory the middle hakeem nicks in on that stop it's a two yard games there is ivory mink kovitch also part of that play defensively for the past they'll make personnel changes devin Smith comes in Zach Stacy returns for New York but part of Chan galas history is obviously is spreading things out so he decides to go with four wide receivers and Zach Stacy on this third down nickel package here for New England Juwan farm in the checks in when his third year out of luck it's where the name that's a fad ever never makes a man miss a daiquiri why the line the game Malcolm Butler got spun around this may be good enough for the Jets after this great effort by Decker he's waist short of the first down with a catch spins away right there from Butler and they're gonna give him a very favorable mark boy they put the football at the 30 he was shorter this might be worth the challenge and there's a challenge flag by the Bell check on the live look it felt very close but then when they placed the football down it looked like he easily got half a yard extra on the spot doing the challenging the ruling on the field with regard to a spot with a first down timeout really smart challenge here coach is upstairs seeing the replay knowing that Decker is coming up short of the first down vinovich will take a look at this let's check out the right elbow of Eric Decker and you're going to see just how shorty is at the 30 yard line nowhere near the yard game bill vinovich after we're doing the play the ruling on the field has changed runner is down for the 30 yard line your right hand ring there's not charged to find out and they win their first challenge so it's four down here and Steve Weatherford is coming on to the field they got to move the football though yeah move it back a half yard there they go you see how Weatherford does this time 31 yards leave the Patriots great field position last time he punted Julian Edelman the return man standing at his own 20yard line Weatherford how much of a rush from the 23 returnable for evidence the tackle and brings it across the 40yard line of 47yard punt 17yard return for Edelman coming up Verizon halftime report JB Bart boomer coach Cowher latest NFL scores and highlights and a preview of Thursday Night Football on CBS at the NFL Network that's coming up on the Verizon halftime report they are deep in conversation getting ready deep supposed to eat some deep guys there you know that 47yard punt was low and so the 17 yard return Nets out 30 so 31 and 30 yards for the last two punts for the Jets and again excellent field position now for the Pats 449 remaining in this make the running play Brady it bounces off of LaFell coverage from Cromartie the rest is very apparent on Brandon LaFell this is his first action of the year after dealing with a foot injury good job by Cromartie with the left hand sneaking between the two hands of LaFell he had 74 catches last season 954 yards and seven touchdowns in his first a Patriots that's his third drop of the first half Brady over the you know who connects Michael Williams stays upright we're gonna say he's down but I'm not sure he ever hit the ground but I know one guy's not getting off the ground that's Calvin Pryor this is a three hundred and four pound tide in landing right on top of you his right elbow is down yes this is a right proper call by the officials but put so Michael Williams at this could be a huge injury for the Jets Calvin Pryor your outstanding strong safety prior on his feet the wind knocked out of me is indicating where's Aubrey they're working on that left leg of ivory just didn't look right early in this game as we check in with Kevin Washburn the guys just a quick update on Aubrey and you just mentioned a deep massage on that left hamstring and I've kept a close eye on him he has not looked comfortable his entire time on the sidelines we've seen him play not really effective but he's constantly working now on that left leg and the athletic trainers are chipping in as soon as I hear anything official about his status I'll let you know all right thanks Evan keep in mind also jets are very thin at safety Deon Bailey steps in formerly with Seattle he was waived by the Seahawks jkwon yeah I was waived by the Jets yesterday to make room for Weatherford he was dealing with an injury Bailey is in this is a 36 after the 4 yard pickup by Michael Woods it's trying to convert 30 connects with drug house team he's not going down he'll dress winner he got a hold of a clonk Jersey but that's not enough to bring down sixfootsix 265pound run cows games and he averages 18 and a half yards per catch that time he goes for 26 he's just the most diamond a tight end in the NFL they are inside the Jeff's 3400 question get stand penalty marker down at the 34 that's a Buster screen coming in here with the big hit watch number 41 here comes off his man and finds Edelman and delivers that legal shot with his shoulder to the chessmen office number 71 10yard penalty repeat first down and a holding call against New England Cameron Fleming forced into a starting role and they've had to mix and match on that offensive line Marcus cannon not available because of a toe injury they moved Sebastian vulnera left side Fleming starting on the right side Klein shifts to left guard for the injured Shaq Mason slow down so now you go to outside are you writing these down down well then all I notice they only have six offensive linemen dressed for this game Calvin Pryor is back in there for the Jets yeah this is a first and 20 now for the England creating pump and throw over the head of Edelman second and 20 now for the Patriots 327 mark of the second quarter now Edelman who had a finger problem last week and a couple of drops and in fact he cost Grady is only interception of the year on a bobble that was picked up that goes right to his page which will flow up to the 24 time ball vibrating yeah I got it over the outstretched hand of David Harrison linebacker number 52 that's that's just beautiful that's playing in the league good news for the Jets prior back in the game but late coming over the officials are huddling up along the sidelines Tom Brady wanted to get this thing going that's part of the Patriots offense is moving quickly and the question is the spot it's a first down like a grievous got his fingertip on that ball and still it had enough to get to LaFell before prior can make the hit so a new set of downs for the Patriots at the 19 of New York we're tied at 10 304 to play first half Rainey throats showing great touch on that ball getting it just over the out the fingers of Revis and the challenge flag is out Todd Bowles could be questioning the spot of that LaFell Durant challenging ruling on the field with the spot with regard to a first down he took the shot from prior and the elbow is down there he's got a good point the slide got him the first down but once that elbow goes down that's it so does this overturn to be third and one they place the football at the 19 yard line and a look at that replay he was short yep so bowls and his coaching staff heads up yeah and your eagle eye we had Belichick question of spot earlier he was correct bowls doing the same now after the LaFell reception where's the hit by Pryor look you can see had to get about the 19 yard line and he's right on the 20 yard line when that elbow hits so be a full yard short of the first down call on the field was a first down Mike Carey our NFL rules X for what you see on that play Mike yeah I am just about the same thing you guys did when the receivers right elbow hits the ball centers left hand it looks like that tail end of the ball is right in the middle of the 20 yard strike they'll put it there and see if it's short which it looks like it is and like it happened right along the Jets sideline so they had a pretty good view of it as well and if they have to measure it they've already moved the chains that's true yes but here's what they have they have the exact spot marked on it change of the lingo back we referred down and a half yard line at the 19 yard line good stuff Mike they're not even gonna have to bother to bring out the chains half a yard short but they have to move the ball back it's still resting on the 19 yard line now the Jets are waiting for the officials to move it this happened earlier as well and now the spot is going to be just inside the 20 and again the Jets have got to be alert for the quarterback sneak by Brady he's already scored a touchdown last time the Patriots had the ball on a sneak they need less than a yard to keep this drive alive Freddie so far 12 of 22 114 yards he has a rushing touchdown for New England white in the backfield he chewed the mic in 1506 michael i williams lines up as a receiver trainee from the gun pressure of crazy is trumped by pace nice comes on the Flitz from the outside and there's nobody to pick him up because James White goes in motion number 97 coming free here and what a huge play smart challenge and then a really creative blitz that time for the Jets by Calvin pace and it turns into a 46 yard attempt for Gus Kowski he's got it New England takes the lead as we hit two minutes to play in the first half Patriots 13 the Jets 10 back with more from Foxborough seven plays 31 yards the 46 yard field goal for New England now the Patriots in front 13 to 10 with two minutes to play in the second quarter Gostkowski will kick it off to a loose ooh just the difference in starting field position to England starting field position aberration their own 46 yard line for the Jets their own 17 we should take it out shorter than 20 and that's where the Jets will open up on this drive with just under two minutes to go coming up Verizon halftime report JB Bart Boomer coach Cowher scores and highlights and a preview of Thursday Night Football on CBS any NFL network it's all coming up on the Verizon halftime report Tom Brady Josh McDaniels working through some things along that sideline and Brady is still the leading rusher for the patriot in 12 yards Fitzpatrick the leading rusher for the Jets with 21 yards Dan Fouts led the charges in rushing once in his career at the center of 1979 with 46 yard Chris Ivery throwing down at the 21 he's a charging loss to Atlanta I had an excuse my daughter Suzanne was born that day before some other things going on in her life I thought I should run more of that day for somebody turn a run to the hospital I think absolutely now her ivory just hasn't looked like himself and that was from the opening play of the game nine carries 12 yards for ivory definitely something wrong with his legs the guy that wears read so much fury 17:8 bootleg Patrick ryan fitzpatrick veering inside across the 25 did a lot of work for the five yard pickup entering this week averaging 115 yards per game that's best in the NFL missed the one game and that was the Jets only loss it came against Philadelphia but still even on that play the the bootleg the fake to ivory was effective against Fitzpatrick's cuts and running that ball to the inside Dan Patriots not using timeouts here the Jets facing a 3rd and 3 with 40 seconds left Patrick gets out of trouble but in piggish level collins marries a high tower first man there and that forced fitzpatrick to twirl around it's a loss of 12 of a play here's Collins this is going to be four and a half sacks now for him but check him out he's basically on a green dog that means if Stacy blocks he's going to come and then he's got the athletic ability to chase down fitzpatrick as he fitzpatrick tries to escape the pocket but you're not going to run past this guy or outrun him Jamie Collins one of the best New England just used its first time out Fitzpatrick set two times in the first five games and now twice today in the first half 24 seconds remaining on the clock and heard you talked about the great field position that the Pacers have had in this first half they're going to get great field position again as Weatherford packs up into his own endzone that picked this one the way to Edelman nebari it to the 41 yard line keep in mind Wingo gets the football as well let's start the second half busters screen has gone to walk away with a shoulder injury for New York what a third in the air for Edelman set eyes under it from the 37 down across the 45 15yard putt Trevor Riley makes the play on special teams a 10yard return for Edelman only 12 seconds left on the clock and now is a great punt by Weatherford because it was high it allows his men to get downfield on Edelman but it also ain't up a lot of seconds off the clock because it was kicked so high so even though Brady has two timeouts he only has 12 seconds try to get Gus Kowski in the range just two catches for Edelman today two catches 14 yards Amendola has three catches for 38 yards Pankowski four catches for 32 yards they may need about 15 yards greater ever better with Rob Gronkowski at least some of it brought down by Davis looked like he was going to get more it turns into 8 yards with 7 seconds left on the clock and that's at least a threepoint tackle there for Davis as you talked about look like Gronkowski had Running Room but check out this dive at the ankles who have a toes of Gronkowski it leaves seven seconds on the clock gust Kowski is getting ready as long as this year 57 that came against Dallas on the road also his career long with Brady's so quick getting the ball up they may be able to afford to try one pass play and immediately call timeout they need seven yards to get into the range seven seconds left and the goal of the motion man Brady for seven is working the sideline LaFell incomplete put the hold on to the football three seconds remain on the clock now the fella has had his struggles today there's no question this ball should have been caught it's thrown low again but he's got both hands on it I just can't haul it in that's four times now for Brandon LaFell in his first action of the season and think about the one catch he didn't have where he took that shot on a deflected ball on Lady steps up his dumped at midfield gents will get credit for a sack in his Sheldon Richardson getting to Tom Brady and that will be the end of the first half the New England Patriots 13 the New York Jets 10 divisional showdown today in Foxborough will come back

  "transcript": "is here this afternoon 58 degrees moments away from the opening kick we bring in the third member of our crew it's heaven launch bird why the Jets winning streak started in week 12 of the win over the Miami Dolphins on this field but according to Todd Bowles the season really shifted the following week when they came back against the New York Times's said we finally finished a game my season doesn't start until you come back to win a game like that well for their season to continue past week 17 they got to get a win here today guys yeah and Evan Bowles made the point the guys are trusting each other a lot more they're not beating themselves like they did in the middle part of the season riding this fourgame winning streak with wins over Miami the Giants Tennessee and Dallas first fourgame winning streak for the team since 2010 New England has won the toss they have deferred to the second half so the Jets will receive Gostkowski will kick it off Antonio Cromartie averaging 25 points seven yards per the turn is the deep man well underway and East Rutherford Cromartie moving : takes it to the outside little Juke move stays on his feet and is marked down at the 24 yard line to rod Harmon on special teams makes the play Ryan Fitzpatrick in his 11th season in the NFL it's been his best year bouncing around he's been an NFL Nomad and he's really found a home with the Jets yeah he really enjoys the chess match that he'll be engaged in today with Bill Belichick and Matt Patricia defensively for the Patriots the Patriots make you win with your third or fourth option they try to take away the Decker's and the Marshalls Patriots open up in the nickel with Leonard Johnson the former Buccaneer Jets will go empty first play from scrimmage the Jets at nine and five at nineteen sixteen win in Gus a lobster too high Bilal Powell over his head incomplete flooding offense for the chance to burkas you off Ferguson big challenge today going against Chandler Jones one of the top sack men in the NFL backs and receivers Chris Ivory comes in on the verge of cracking 1,000 yards for the first time in his career he's 49 yards away Jones 12 and a half sacks to lead New England a former Patriot Ken Burrell Thompkins is in had a big catch last week against Dallas running play wow what a difference maker Powell has been for the Jets over the last month carpenter and mangle creating some space for Powell to the tune of 16 yards on the rip but you can see the natural hole right here between nook carpenter and mangle and that's exactly where pals going to hit this one Patriots were late lining up defensively and Powell takes advantage of it for 16 yards Todd Bowles said Powell has given the team a spark they liked the onetwo punch they have now with ivory and it's ivory in there now with a new set of downs for the Jets to work with Kellen Davis sets up on the outside now goes in motion play clock winding down Fitzpatrick sets it up didn't have enough on it try to hit Thompkins it's incomplete defensively for the New England Patriots they come in number 6 overall Jones go to the football for the first time in his four years in the NFL Jamie Collins welldeserved Pro Bowl nod for him one of the best allaround linebackers in football no Patrick Chung no Devin McCourty Jordan Richards the rookie out of stanford getting the start along with harmon and matt patricia mr. graphite number two pencil second and ten chuck up on again ivory hit from behind Alan branch with dust stamp it's a twoyard pickup for ivory brings up third and long now for the Jets first possession of the day they get big thing about Chris Ivory at this point of the season he's as healthy as he's ever been and it really shows in his quickness and his explosion that time good job coming back and falling into that one Allan branch he came to a short gain and bringing up a third and long for the Jets it's a dime package here for New England with Justin Coleman in the wall Powell sets up behind Fitzpatrick rushes on Fitzpatrick just over the head of Heenan wah he had a step on the Pro Bowler Malcolm Butler now in in what gets behind Butler but as he's running down the field he's kind of losing his balance a little bit not really running through the catch trying to accelerate you can see him just flailing at this ball thrown about six inches too far Keshawn Martin is the deep man for New England and Ryan Kruger this has been very inconsistent part of the Jets game special teams this season not me fair catch call Torrey actually had some room to work with but he brings it and cleanly run around the 12 yard line it's a 47yard punt Tom Brady had the New England off the atomic molded D thought seems every week Tom Brady is involved in some kind of record 400 passing touchdowns it's one shy a time the NFL record with one team held by Brett Favre Rob Gronkowski sets up as a receiver on the outside first play from scrimmage for New England today no score 13:09 to play in the first lady swing it to Brandon Bolden veers to the outside and golden chased down by Demario Davis it's a four yard pickup offensive line brian stork is back in and trade jackson getting the start for the injured Josh Klein stealing with a shoulder injury backs and receivers little more responsibility for Keshawn Martin that knee injury for Danny Amendola he did not make the trip Steven Jackson looking to make his Patriots debut in his 12th year in the NFL signed earlier this week five receivers set on a second and six for New England Brady has time Brady with a strike to golden first down New England 14yard pickup now Brady reading the coverage he saw that Revis was on Gronkowski and so single coverage on the outside against the linebacker Demario Davis Davis giving Bolden way too much room that spin move after the hit by Davis picks up a couple extra yards Brandon Bolden had a season high 28 snaps last week in a 33 16 win over Tennessee two tight ends in this formation give it to Bolden up the gut that hits on the side it was a combination of Calvin prior and Demario Davis through yard pickup for Bolden talked to Tom Brady about his 11th Pro Bowl selection he says yeah it's it's a tremendous honor played with a lot of great guys but he doesn't want to go he doesn't want to go because it's week before the Super Bowl that will be played at Santa Clara not too far from his hometown of San Mateo California and that's amazing throughout his career didn't play at Candlestick he was injured the one year the Patriots went out there and his parents have never been to Levi's Stadium wouldn't it their first time be of beauty with time plan and the patient's second at 7:30 pump fake and after all underneath getting Keshawn Martin involved that is short of the first down 6 yard pickup David Harris there Harris was a question mark to play in this game because of a lower back injury New England will make some personnel changes Joey Iosefa who made his NFL debut last week the rookie out of Hawaii sixfoot 247 pound hybrid tailback fullback is in Gronkowski demotion man had a big game the last time these two teams met their sofa tonight at the line of scrimmage comes up short Demario Davis first man there it'll be fourth and less than a yard what do you do if you're Bill Belichick yeah both David Harris and Demario Davis shoot the gap here Davis gets blocked but he fights off the block and just stones Josefa right in the backfield good effort by Yosef is trying to spin and pick up the first down then we got an injury here it's Sebastian Vollmer who has been starting at the left tackle Nate solder went on IR with a bicep injury carted off solo Adrian Waddell would be the next man up to protect Tom Brady he was just picked up off of waivers in Detroit Brian Allen punts it Jeremy Kerley back peddling this ball little backs up in the air and the Patriots down it inside the 10 Jets deep in their own territory as Brandon king makes his way downfield 52 yard punt here's Fullmer right here this happened so often as yo cephus spins he's going to get hit by Harris and pace and they fall back on the left leg of Sebastian Vollmer how many more injuries in this Patriot team suffered and still maintained their excellence so the option is to move waddle into right tackle and cannon to left tackle or they try waddle at left tackle and keep cannon at that right tackle spot we'll find out when New England gets the football back Jets have it first and 10 at their own 9 yard this war play fake Kotecha looking for his conclusion there it is Eric Decker first down Jets Brian Fitzpatrick on the money for 25 yards now it's playaction passing because the Jets have moved the ball on the ground in their first drive so the linebackers and the safeties have to respect that run as Decker gets in behind Leonard Johnson huge play coming off their own part of the field deep in their own end for 25 yards Eric Decker closing in on 1000 yards he did it twice as a member of the Denver Broncos who set it down for the Jets for ivory Chicago and ivory crosses the 35 yard line three yard pickup it was Jones who had a chance to bring him down initially yeah Jones went a little bit too high on the tackle trying to grab the shoulders of ivory but ivory is as explosive and tough to bring down with first contact you can see the balance of ivory as he pulls away from Jones for a short game second and seven ivory remains in there their feet a to try to slash inside just across the 40yard line well earned four yards jabal sheared who has really been a perfect fit for this New England offense makes the play well he has seven sacks coming over from Cleveland I'm not sure the Patriots expected that type of production from them but they're glad they have it what a combination with Chandler Jones and Jamie Collins Patriots number one tied with Denver for most sacks in the NFL they have never loved the leave in sacks under Bill Belichick they've done basically everything else third and three did Patrick he's got enough Marshall first down fiveyard pickup Brandon Marshall 150 career games no playoff appearances for Marshall well this is the post move isn't it Birds getting in the deepfat please father deep what do you wouldn't how deep is that there for a postman that's right up in the it's on there where you can't even foul a guy right absolutely whatever you say I'm with you i cosigned your analysis that was an analysis first down from the 46 micros on whatever you say it's my basketball reference how they do barrels into New England territory across the 45 11 yard rip to Powell yeah it's another draw play here for Powell Powell off to an outstanding start three carries 29 yards and then running over the defensive back Doron Hartmann here taking a page out of Chris ivories playbook falling forward for extra yards and you're taking a page out of the Czar of the telestrator 'z notebook no thanks you can have it first and 10 play fake moving pocket fitzpatrick soft toss ivory loses the football and it bounces out of bounds Jordan Richards knocks it away no harm done for the Jets ivories only fumbled four times now on the season just lost two of them but that's a perfect hand placement by Jordan Richards got the left hand on the ball and they'll mark the ball back where it went out of bounds so he's gonna lose about two or three yards on that fumble down to 634 remaining in this opening quarter Todd Bowles said a lot of the players on this Jets team they just haven't been through a potential playoff one so you do have to address it each week make sure everybody understands that's on the line ivory the cup ivory the zigzag forward progress will get him to the 36 so a six yard gain for ivory not enough for the first out and it's decision time for the Jets versatility if ivory out of the backfield the first guy just has no shot against him bring up a third down and three in the Jets this year fourth best team in the NFL converting third downs at 41% Brandon Marshall sets up off to the side of Fitzpatrick now heads into the slot it's a third and three Fitzpatrick underneath it's caught the former Patriot Ken Burrell Thompkins he was waived by New England in October looked up with the Jets on the practice squad and now he's becoming a factor throwing at Leonard Johnson well I watch where this ball is thrown to right to the body of Thompkins no way that Thompson can go if Johnson rather can go around Thompkins to knock it away beautiful throw by Fitzpatrick who's now five for five on this Drive he was old three to open the day and those first three were all long balls down the field too just missed on that one too a noon why ain't none want emotion man on first down there's Alain Chris Ivery dick down low looked like ivory could take it the distance carpenter and mangled moving people up front 17 yard game again there's this natural hole here and the Jets are just exploiting it with ivory and Powell ivory gets to 10 yards 12 yards down the field before he is even contacted by a patriot 17 yards on the game and he's opposed to going all the way in Jets are on the move inside the New England 15 looking a strike first in this opening quarter give it up ivory trying to turn the corner and his head along the sideline it's a gain of 1 JB Bart Scott NFL today update they've got you covered a game with playoff implications Bart robbery week voter records out as Ryan Mallett drops back and finds Chris Matthews for the 8yard score Baltimore least 70 all right back to Iron Eagle Dan Fouts and Evan Washburn Baltimore has gone through so many quarterbacks this season mallet the latest to get an opportunity and that's a pivotal game for Jets fans as well considering what has to happen for the Czechs to make the playoffs they need wins and they need help second and nine Fitzpatrick upstairs it's too high for Dekker oneonone with Malcom Butler now back in October Decker had a big day against the Patriots secondary six catches 94 yards was denied the end zone and that time that ball just sailed over the left shoulder where Decker was expecting it over his right shoulder 12th play of the drive it's taken up over seven minutes of game at you keeping Tom Brady in the offense of the Patriots on the sidelines third and 9 operating out of the gun but Patrick lets it fly in John Hopkins hauls it in but he was out of bounds Justin Coleman the rookie at a Tennessee matched up with Ken Morrell Thompkins its fourth down yet if he makes his catch he's going to land out of bounds clearly out of bounds and the ball comes loose Thompkins who has four career touchdown receptions all with the Patriots missed that one by about a yard Randy Bullock on for a 30yard field goal attempt he missed a 45 yarder last week against Dallas also missed an extra point 230 yards away Bullock splits the uprights the Jets with a three nothing lead on New England we've got 319 denominates one player for the award and three finalists will be announced in January the winner will be announced at the NFL honors awards Hill February 6th on CBS this year's nominee for the Patriots Devin McCourty for the Jets Eric Decker McCourty has worked to raise awareness and funds to fight sicklecell disease Decker found at Decker's dogs which helps fund the rescue care and training of service dogs for veterans jets with a three nothing lead on New England kicks it off with Keshawn Martin waiting for it we are deep in the end zone he's going to take it out monkey takes a pop just short of the 25 yard line by Cumberland on special teams three nothing jets on front parading in the Pats st. at right tackle handed off to Bolden dust is putting a bit Holden gets spun down it's a twoyard gain as Leonard Williams was there with Aaron Henderson by now let's check in with Evan Washburn well guys you can often understand the severity of an injury when you see the opposing team concerned and Sebastian Palmer has been ruled out for this game with that leg injury so the blind spot for Brady continues to be a rotating position guys right thanks very much they game and white in the backfield with Brady Jessie there defensively emboldened did not have an angle Buster screamed ranging over for New York no gain on the play for the Pats and screen was in mantoman coverage on Keshawn Martin came off that coverage to fly up and take out the legs Bouldin right now the Jets defense playing inspired football Grady four for four but three of them have been to Bouldin on swing passes this Patriot offense number three in the NFL and scoring 31 point one points per game flags come down there was a jump at Malden jumped in the neutral zone made contact free five yards for Brady and company cleat Blakeman we'll hear from him for the first time approachment defense that David Harris isn't too happy about that it was Malden let's balls and eat jumps right into the face of shaq Mason it's a time package here for the Jets with markets rulings in along with Buster's screen the penalty gives New England a third and three opportunity working out of the gun play clock down to two down to one Brady trying to set the screen right they blow it up David Harris sniffs it out it's a loss of five on the play though watch David Harris here he's got bold and mantoman coverage he's directing traffic getting guys lined up right watch him go right to the screen here Bolden didn't have a shot Brian Allen will put it Jeremy Kerley standing at the 25yard line surely settles under it surely solid return for curly in a tight area with the Pro Bowler Matthew Slater over there 41yard punt and at eight yard return for curling Jets defense fired up surely Jets have a three nothing lead on New England opening quarter B four yards of offense in this first quarter the Jets have 97 yards Steven Ridley former Patriot is in Fitzpatrick on a boot steps up Fitzpatrick dials up the deep ball incomplete Eric Decker in a battle with Malcom Butler they were just working on Rob Ning kovitch who is limping noticeably along the New England sideline and make a bitch back in October knocked down four of Fitzpatrick tsa's passes at the line of scrimmage yeah Fitzpatrick said Lincoln bitch has been a thorn in his side going back to his Buffalo days he always seems to be in the area where Ryan Fitzpatrick is trying to operate second and ten for the Jets under a minute to go now in the first turns it upfield the wild card pounds towel has become an xfactor 15 yards on the kitchen run his quickness is so apparent once he caught that ball he just sped through the coverage of the Patriots you can see he's gets mangled out in front and that's all he needs to get down the field for that gain of 15 we asked ivory about Powell he said he always seems to create explosion plays he changes the pace of the game and consistently comes through on third down that was a second down but he turns it into a first down inside the New England 45 final play of the opening quarter by bouncing off the initial tackler and pearls for a gain of a yard and a half jock of Nene getting into it with a key hit as we in the first quarter in he's thruster three nothing those Jets on top of the Patriots welcome back to the Meadowlands after these messages you're watching CB s home of Super Bowl 50 now on a training table on the Jets sideline Bulow Powell has certainly been a contributor so far 2 carries 27 yards one catch for 15 yards and he's in the backfield by a second and 9 first play of the second quarter patrick fires off the hands of Eric Decker incomplete rather tense have had a lot of success running right at the Patriots this afternoon right between the tackles Val goes for 16 there and another 10 here and then Chris Ivory gets in the act with a 17 yard there averaging nearly seven yards at carries running right at the patriots defensive line and linebackers they were checking out the right leg of Chris Ivery 3rd and 9 now for the Jets just underway 2nd quarter at MetLife Fitzpatrick decal separation could not make the connection with Thompkins and he had a step and a half on the defender passes twice now that def Fitzpatrick has missed on a home run ball good move there by Thompkins as he shakes Coleman and now that ball three yards too far not enough arch on that ball threw it on a line drive very difficult to adjust to a line drive past that far down the field for Thompkins so while the Jets may be dominated in the numbers they're not dominating the scoreboard it's 3nothing the punch them quickly Martin the fair catch and a flag is down 35 yard punt wellplaced both teams waiting on the call and Blakeman heading over to the new england sideline to have a chat with Bill Belichick Patriots have already clinched a first round by they would clinch homefield advantage in the AFC with a victory here today the use of hands answer the face kicking team number 54 bring Alexa add that fiveyard penalty to him to kick first down New England it's Jamari Lattimore called on the penalty Tuesday on CBS it's a starstudded night celebrating legendary artists including the man behind Star Wars George Lucas Stephen Colbert hosts the Kennedy Center Honors Tuesday at 9/8 central only CBS double a punt so far through New England yet to get their offense in gear Grady is a perfect 5 of 5 but only 19 yards and who da Dead's Gronkowski and Willie Wright and GaN Kowski no catches so far I'm gonna gadget play on the blast 5 Martin spin move he gets hit by Muhammad and Wilkerson going to the Pro Bowl for the first time in his career a free agent at the end of the season 6 yard kick up there for Martin the former Texan the Jets giving extra attention to Rob Gronkowski here you can see that Cromartie on him but Don Kowski obviously blocking on this play but we've seen boom Rd on him and we've seen Revis on him and now we see Jackson in the backfield his first snap for the Patriots former member of the Rams and a Falcons Jackson gets the call and Jackson picks up five yards it's enough for a first down well the resume is impressive for Steven Jackson first round draft pick of st. Louis out of Oregon State big physical in his day he was a workhorse came in with just under 11,000 400 career yards good for 18th place on the alltime list line of scrimmage is the 25 and a new set of downs for New England to work with still early stages second quarter cleanup in the lead for the Jets Jackson again tries to cut it back and he stacked up loss of one on the play now this is something that Bill Belichick has done through the years he's picked up running backs maybe later in their career Antoine Smith Corey Dillon Dillon did have over a thousand yards in the season with the Patriots so he still had a lot left in the tank but Sammy Morris Lamont Jordan Taylor these were guys that had success elsewhere and then would play more of a bit role and fill out a niche for New England in the running attack second and 11 now for the Patriots chukka timing rock trying to get drunk and fire juggle in a catch Gronkowski hauls it in against Cromartie and it's just a fade route for Gronkowski but he's got such a long and wide catching radius look out he reaches out in front of him juggles just slightly but hauls it in for 30 but that's a guy of the ways 265 getting behind a defensive back in Antonio Cromartie one of seventh roll bowlers on the Patriots this season Gronk going to the flow Bowl for the fourth time in his career Cameron's Fleming is in six offensive lineman and adapt for them pitch it back Brady looking Depot incomplete Gronkowski downfield Darrelle Revis back there for New York now Brady shows that he can miss an open receiver as well although Revis has good coverage on Gronkowski well executed lateral by Bouldin Revis closing quickly on that ball but it's just slightly overthrown sets up a second and 10 New England is in New York territory but 1206 to go in this first half running play white razzledazzle till affair McLaren leans forward with a flag back of the 49 LaFell has enough for the first out jets are pointing in the Patriots direction for the penalty and Brian stork looking awfully guilty to Josh McDaniels going into the bag of tricks he knows it there is no number 66 is Brian stork left side of the screen here he's going to peel back and hit Malden so they pulled the flag up yep and it's now third and one they marked LaFell just short of the first out that the Patriots know it's going to be tough running straight at the jet defense so they're trying trick plays to get their speed players on the perimeter and it's worked so far in this Drive and another trick Brady now lines up on the outside and Wildcat for Bouldin rather than looking for the first down it is close very close Leonard Williams and David Harris were there he looks short it's fourth down but in this area in the field Bill Belichick's going forth yeah and his leaving Steven Jackson on the sidelines they tried yosef on a short yardage play in the first quarter and now they're spreading things out right now would be a 55 yard field goal attempt they're going for it fourth and less than a yard pretty walls pretty close it's complete James who might working the perimeter for a first down touch pass from Brady brilliant yours really good patience by Brady didn't have white to begin with because Wilkerson was right in his face so he lets Wilkerson come in on him and then lofts it softly over his head to white good play by Wilkerson but a little bit late he forces created a clutch on that one but that is mr. clutch Tom Brady 9 play of the drive there inside the Jets 45 my millionman second catch for white it's a pitch for bolder turns out he'll go then brought down inside the 20 Marcus Gilchrist Darrell we leave us over there five five and a half yard game depending on the spot and again it's a perimeter play a lot of tosses sweeps we've seen the Wildcat Josh McDaniels realizing that going up against this jet defensive his second in the NFL against the run at just 82 yards a game not going to make too much although Steven Jackson is in the game now Patriots were held to just 16 yards rushing in the first meeting it's a running play to Stephen Jackson not a whole lot of room there to yard pickup as Mohammad Wilkerson brings him down but that's what Steven Jackson's game is all about it's really running between the tackles is the real north/south runner and with a lot of power you just have to see how much he's got left in the tank though he played for McDaniels when McDaniels was the offensive coordinator in st. Louis so there is familiarity there with the offense and 11th play of the drive this is a third and three for New England and even nine minutes to go in this first half Jets with a three nothing lead Gronkowski goes in motion will get a timeout Patriots call one stop the clock with 855 remaining in the second quarter thought your fantasy season was over well it's not play for free and you could win a trip to Super Bowl 51 in 2017 join today at nfl.com slash playoff challenge Tom Brady is the only Patriots offensive player to start every game at the same position this season they've had to make changes every single week and it's reflected in their game plans which are never the same weekend in week out and that keeps everybody interested because it's never boring as real testament to Josh McDaniels the system Bill Belichick and of course Brady to make it all work after the timeout third and three for the Patriots shaaka faked the handoff grating slips it to no man's land it's incomplete Moulton put the heat on Brady and its fourth down for New England now the Jets don't get a lot of sex they've only had twenty all season but they do pressure the quarterback and it's usually right up the middle you can see Brady not liking his first option there tries to come late to Keshawn Martin matrix now over four on third downs the secondmost blitzes in the NFL this season the Jets chest behind Arizona Stephen Gostkowski going with a full bowl once again this is a fiveyard attempt and he nails it we are tied at three and three with 846 to play first half more the Patriots and Jets after this Gus Kowski with the 35yard field goal and we're even 3 apiece 846 left to play in this first half does Kowski will kick it off Antonio Cromartie is deep so the back of the endzone Cromartie takes a knee jets will have it at the 20yard line we're welcome to back MetLife Stadium opened back in 2010 exit 16 W off the New Jersey Turnpike that's gotten to know the Turnpike quite well this season love it what exit are you Dan I'm all exits cap first and ten from the 24 Fitzpatrick Catching Fire by Marshall Brandon Marshall goal of the Pro Bowl for the sixth time in his career that's a six yard pickup injury updates from Evan Washburn guys Jets Patriots around two and Chris Ivery is dealing with an injury once again it's his right knee the official word is questionable I saw the athletic trainers it was less structural look more like they were massaging they added an ointment to it and also robbed Nick of issues out there it was a laceration or bruise on that lower left leg they put a pad on it so just to keep an eye on him I'll update ivory if anything changes all right haven't Steven Ridley is in here right now with the law powpow Pawel first down jabal sheared will get credit for the tackle that's a six yard game for Powell now Fitzpatrick 7 to 15 in the first half but he's missed a lot of opportunity here that one to Powell down the sidelines overshoots a new noix here Decker's got a jump ball situation on that one and then this one really hurt Tompkins behind the defense he's been getting good pass protection but he has to convert on some of those gamechanging type of passes the Patrick came in three touchdowns away from matching Vinny Testaverde suitor Susan Fairchild met Steven Ridley which Fitzpatrick getting out and blocking for New York well of course he's out in front blocking he's at quarterback he's an athlete watch number 14 good number two as he realizes that Ridley's got nothing right up the middle so follow the quarterback around the corner and then kind of a weak attempt but it does get Ridley about two extra yards and close to a first down good job Fitz Brian Fitzpatrick is 7 of 15 65 yards but keep it on the ground stutter steps and literally gets it past the sticks at the 3 yard gain and a first down for New York and don't you think that Ridley's a little bit fired up about having his opportunity against his former team it signed a oneyear 1.25 million dollar deal with the New York Jets torn ACL and MCL last season with New England Chris Ivory back in the locker room so Ridley getting an opportunity here this game tied at 3 we come up on the 6 minute mark of the second quarter that's happened at their own 45 playaction Patrick steps up Brandon Marshall tremendous hands but he's out of bounds Logan Ryan with a matchup Marshall thought he was in bounds and thought it was clean now we'll just see it is a good catch here left foot in right foot out good call by the official right on the spottier that tight coverage by logan ryan heck of a catch but no catch did he have control of it when the right foot was down it looks like it was just after he lifted the right foot that he hauled it in really had no chance that ball kit scared him all the way to the sidelines and out of bounds Marshall 174 yards away from setting the new Jets Edo season Malala Pal spilled out on the outside that's a four yard pickup Collins combining with Logan Ryan on the hit never miss a moment of football action with the CBS sports app every play and score every game and every highlight

remains in their five and a half to go in this first half out of the gun Fitzpatrick sets it up nicely for Thompkins he's got a first down across the 40 yard line into New England territory catching run of 12 yards really a key block to by Quincy at noon WA on the man who's trying to guard Thompkins tremendous spin move there on Harmon the Jets can make the playoffs by winning their last two games in getting a loss by either Kansas City Denver and Pittsburgh they play the dry Ridley there the cut tremendous spin move there on Harmon the Jets can make the playoffs by winning their last two games and getting a loss by either Kansas City Denver and Pittsburgh they play the dry Whitley where the cut weaves through traffic good block by Ferguson that's a sevenyard pickup so that's one scenario the other scenario is the Jets win one of their last two games they take on Buffalo next week and then Denver Kansas City or Pittsburgh loses two games to end the season Kansas City currently up ten three Pittsburgh down ten three here in a week 16 of the NFL we're counting down to the fourminute mark of the second quarter Jets and Patriots are tied at three let's Patrick brings it to Tompkins a featured role Jen Burrell Tompkins working against Leonard Johnson he's winning the match up 12 yard pickup and another first down for the dress that's his third catch of the first half to watch the sidearm shot there by Fitzpatrick as he fades away away from the defensive rush there and puts the ball right on the money as Braun is bearing down on him veteran moved by the quarterback in Tompkins enjoying a great first half jets are at the New England 20 we're down to three and a half to play in the second quarter Bohannon lead blocker give it to Ridley not much there stumbles for free jabal sheared in on that stop that's one of the type of plays where you send the fullback one way hoping the linebackers will follow the fullback and then it's a counter play back to the strong side but the Patriots are having none of it and they stop Ridley for a short game with the Jets doing a great job on the ground 87 yards rushing already Jets had 372 yards of offense in the victory over Dallas only 73 on the ground they've got a hundred 76 yards in this first half second and seven Decker goes in motion grunting play again pal bursting through it's short of a first down as Johnson got him down low five yard gain for Bilal pal get credit to Mike Tannenbaum former GM of the Jets who always believed in Bilal Powell and thought there would be a role for him at this level and also putting together a pretty good offensive line that's dominating this first half Ferguson carpenter Mango winners and Jack Kamini doing a great job of providing space for PAL obviously Mike McKagan has taken over the GM duties with John exec in between the two zip it out pal in space inside the five first and goal for the Jets 10yard kick up another conversion on third down four of seven now and Powell takes this one inside the box scores highlights all coming off horizon halftime report first and goal for the Jets New York looking for the lead Marshall emotion not sure the catch and the touchdown Fitzpatrick delivers the Jets go in front late stages of the second quarter 13 plays 80 yards for New York at Fitzpatrick 506 on the drive another little side arm sling here Marshall wisely stretches out and puts the ball across the goal line here as he beats Ryan well designed play by offensive coordinator Chan Gailey another touchdown reception for Marshall 12 now on the season so that's 22 combined for Marshall and Decker the best onetwo punch in Jets history among after review the ruling on the field is confirmed though on the touchdown stands Fitzpatrick to Marshall that is 27 now on the season for Ryan Fitzpatrick that he Testaverde set the singleseason mark with 29 back in 1998 extra Floyd coming from Randy Bullock he's got it but 103 lead for the Jets 157 to play first half Brandon Marshall got the angle bill belichick steam is now down by seven singleseason franchise history branded Marshall 12 touchdowns to behind Don Maynard and art Powell who set the mark back in the 60s Maynard number retired number 13 for the Bullock will kick it off plenty of time for the end of the worid Patriots have two timeouts left Keshawn Martin and a 75 yard kickoff between the last week against Tennessee goes down just across the 15 hit by Trevor Riley on special teams coming up Verizon halftime report JB Tony Bart dolma coach Cowher lettuce Ted of fell scores and highlights that's cozy in there all coming up Verizon halftime report any we're chillin weren't then tell what you call it yeah yeah chillin I like you and me right up here now this great game in this first half first and ten from the sixteenth New England Boldin it's got a hole keeps the legs moving and Holden with a first down run that block from Marcus Kenan remember Sebastian Vollmer went down with a leg injury sole Adrian Waddell is in the lineup at left tackle cannon playing right tackle for New England no Josh climbed today out with a shoulder injury trae Jackson in at right guard Bryant stork was enacted last week he's back in there started at center and the rookie Shaq Mason at left guard balled it again jetzt already form picks up two yards on the play David Harris among those there for New York LeGarrette want done for the seat of Dion Lewis on IR as well New England going conservative here really taking their time as James White late to join the huddle replacing Bolden we're not a 44 seconds left Patriots will get the football to start the second half Berni out of the gun after the catch by whitey was hit by Calvin Pryor the third his time ticket away down to 22 seconds left and they got two timeouts to work with obviously content to go in and halftime down by seven make their adjustments and then get the opening kickoff of the second half well you alluded to it earlier Fitzpatrick and the mental challenge you have going against Bill Belichick he said the adjustments they make in game and after halftime are so impressive and obviously the Jets I anticipate some of those going into the second half but New England didn't go with the aggressive route at the end of the first half it's ten three Jets at half time horizon halftime the fullsi on Eagle Dan Fouts Kevin Washburn Patriots took their foot off the gas at the end of the second quarter it was set up for them to at least get into field goal range Bill Belichick and company deciding nope they're gonna head to the locker room down ten three let's deal with that part first ad well I think the big thing is that Belichick wanted to get into the locker room and like these guys up a little bit they had a good run on first down with Ridley going for or Bolan going for about 11 yards there out to the 35 with two timeouts a lot of time left for Tom Brady but you know no Amendola no Edelman and Gronkowski with just one catch in that first half it was a big one though for 30 yards over Antonio Cromartie but it's been they you know after catching 11 balls in October for 108 yards Gronkowski doing a lot of blocking here in the first half and then on the big fleaflicker shot when he had a chance to make a big play against Darrelle Revis Grady overthrows Gronkowski at the 15yard line only two targets all day long those two for Gronkowski follow your favorite team all season long go to iTunes comm slash NFL start of the third quarter here in East Rutherford the Jets at 9 and 5 the Patriots are 12 and 2 best record in the AFC the Jets in the hunt for a wildcard spot there's a chance the Jets could finish 11 and 5 this season and not make the playoffs the last team to do that finish 11 and 5 and not qualify for the postseason the New England Patriots 2008 the year that Brady's sustained the knee injury in the season opener and Matt Cassel took over Chris Ivory is back on the Jets sideline bullet over the head of Martin Patriots will have it at the 20 yard line is we said it to Evan Washburn guys spoke to Bill Belichick about the offense he didn't want to point to a specific issue he just said everything has to be better he said field position was a bit of a problem in that first half defensively for the Patriots he said they have to stop the run and that's what the Jets loved about the first half Todd Bowles saying the best version of their offense was runs up the middle sprinkle in the pass and win that time of possession guys Evan 193 yards of offense for the Jets in the first half take over first and ten from the twenty first play from scrimmage to the second half ready play action they get front Kowski veers to the outside for a first down 21 yards on the hookup Wow three targets now for Gronkowski it's a slant route across the middle as he finds a huge gaping hole in the secondary takes a long time for Gilchrist to get to him Gilchrist trying to chop that ball out yeah I gotta pull it out of those big arms Ron Haskins 68 pitches on the season over 1,100 yards running play James White running inside for three met by the rookie Leonard Williams along with Demario Davis told you about the yardage first downs jets with 13 of them though England takes an offer on third down conversion over four they did convert one fourth down play but that over force got to be really troubling with Josh McDaniels Brady and Belichick second and seven here for the Patriots Montana motion man hoodie Punk's timing around Mach Peter with the catch perfectly executed working against Buster screen a fifteen yards on the rainbow a spectacular pass screens got good coverage to Brady again has two double clutch on this one but drops it right over the top of screen and Martin hanging with this ball stretching out making a big catch there to put the ball into jet territory and Calvin Pryor just limped off for the Jets he suffered a high ankle sprain in the first meeting between these two teams back in October so wrong tez mile steps in for him that could be a big loss for the Jets Pryor the enforcer in that secondary for the Jets big hitter in his in his flank pointy and a first intent at the New York Court pretty receptive Darrelle Revis walk down de Rivaz picks off brainy on a 19yard return New England turns it over early in the third Aruba that Terrell Lee this has intercepted Tom Brady his first against Brady since 2009 fifth of the season for Revis Jets take over ivory is back in slow down Butler helping and run support first man there is sheared on the slant route here looks like Gronkowski expecting the ball earlier didn't get it and I think that the way that the pressure comes from 91 right side of the screen Richardson forces that early throw but Revis realizing that Brady trying to get Gronkowski involved in the offense early in the second half has to be the most surprised guy to be able to catch that ball as it sells behind Gronkowski both players downplayed any rift between the two Brady and Revis teammates last year and Super Bowl winning team patrick has time that's it open man is Marshall first out into New England territory Logan Ryan there for the Patriots defensively that's 19 yards on the pass and catch a classic dig route down and in for Marshall in front of Ryan and Fitzpatrick again enjoying tremendous pass protection here watch Ferguson here on Chandler Jones Jones got to is he passes off Jones to James Carpenter he's having a big day as well 97 catches on the season for Brandon Marshall it's a new singleseason record in Jets history Fitzpatrick been feeding him the football once again matched up with Logan Ryan and you see the wink there that Marshall gave his quarterback this is because he looks back and he sees the ball coming right away and then the strength and size is enough to beat the real tight coverage by Logan Ryan Ryan the Rutgers product out of Voorhees New Jersey up and down his first two years he's been more consistent here in year three for the Patriots push down to the jet why nobody cuff her Decker to where was that Eric Decker was by himself when the officials decided to go cover him I almost you almost expect to come out of one of these Huddle's is for Cleef Blakeman to yell Columbia 3 spoon 11 minutes 23 seconds on the game clock 11:23 they're resetting the game clock they had moved the football Jets we're trying to line up yeah it's Decker hey throw me the ball quick and the officials get tight coverage there it's a first down at the 32 Howell is in there and with ivory moving pocket tops over the middle to Chris Ivory and a modest gain hit by Chandler Jones on the play it's a twoyard pickup but week 14 late in the first half the Titans were confused on defense nobody was covering Brandon Marshall and Ryan Fitzpatrick quickly snapped it found Marshall outran the defense for a 69 yard touchdown almost had a similar scenario there with Decker and that was coming out of a timeout too for the Titans a little late with their substitution package either he Sprint's to the outside second late mix it up with pal plays bang down with a flag thrown hit by Malcolm Brown the rookie out of Texas penalty marker at the 31 I think you can get James Carpenter offense in the 77 10yard penalty still second down 10:24 to play in the third GX leading the Patriots ten to three Jets got the turnover when freddie was picked off by Darrelle Revis now they face a second in a team from the New England 40yard line no penalties against the cats today we against New York click walk down the run the Patrick steps up is that moon day on which Patrick goes down headfirst 7 yard scramble for Ryan Fitzpatrick Chandler Jones still looking for his first sack of the day after getting to last week in a forced fumble here good job by Ferguson to run him by the pocket Fitzpatrick a classic dropback passer knowing stepping up in the pocket is imperative and if fearless runner after he breaks the line of scrimmage there have been no leash acts either way we've got 9 24 to go in the fort this is a third and 11 for the Jets working out of the gun the console sex toys in charge Japan Marshall fair touchdown Marshall just started Harmon 33 yards on the hookup now at times when the quarterback must have faith in his receiver and that's what Fitzpatrick has in Marshall let this ball go early and then watch the adjustment that Marshall has to make as he gets around Harmon and then makes a catch in the endzone tremendous move by Marshall as Harmon reaching back can't deflected Fitzpatrick a perfect 4 for 4 in the drive 65 yards and that beautiful touchdown pass extra point is good from bullock bread and marshal said about Ryan Fitzpatrick I knew a little bit about his background before he got to the Jets what I didn't know is he's one of the most competitive guys I've ever been around jets elite except and Mike macaque didn't pulled off a steal of a deal with the Bears acquiring Brandon Marshall for a fifth round draft pick Marshall is set a Jets record for receptions in a season two more touchdowns here today giving him 13 he now has 99 catches kickoff from the boy Martin takes a knee Patriots will have it up to 20 they're down 14 grand adjustment by Marshall as he cuts underneath Harmon and makes the catch grand marshal new careerhigh 13 touchdowns this season he has helped give the Jets of 17 to three lead New England has been held to a hundred fiftythree yards of offense we've got nine thirteen to play in the third Chuck entra brain he throws the ball get underneath Holden turns it upfield brought down by Aaron Henderson on the play eleven yards on the pass play well go back to the touchdown here is Harmon deep safety and Marshall in the group here now because he's playing so deep Marshall has to give him a little hesitation and then get down the field that little move there freezes Harmon and then cutting underneath the defensive back is a tremendous adjustment on that 33 yard TD catch remember the job is my two Revis interception entry to the 14.4 lady wide open downfield Keshawn Martin he's brought down at the 45 24 yards through the air playing without Danny Amendola out of the knee injury though Julian Edelman still out with the foot injury may you see Martin working in the slot where Amendola and Edelman have so much success but you can't give Tom Brady that much time to find Martin down the field like that the Jets electing to just go with a fourman pass which they would burn and Dan calvin choir is in the game for the Jets to Titanes Gronkowski and Williams Martin the motion man for New England running plays with Bergen wow it's through the middle and picks up three Aaron Henderson once again involved in the stop for New York seven carries 28 yards for Boldin AFC wild card picture Kansas City Pittsburgh the Jets all at nine and fought Baltimore's got the lead on Pittsburgh Kansas City comfortably in front of Cleveland a loss spot the Steelers and again by the Jets opens the door up to the Jets to control their own industrial over the middle Brandon LaFell Brady on time for a 19 yard strike and New England is on the move inside the New York 25 and has a huge hole in the second area the Jets there for LaFell that there was nobody within five yards of him when he made that catch again Brady with time to throw picking the Jets defense apart on this Drive Patriots have been a machine in the month of December 26 and five in a row best in the NFL since 2001 golden blocked out Sheldon Richardson leading the charge it's a one yard pickup for the fourth year running back Brandon Bulldog Richardson showing his versatility seen him put pressure on Brady that too may have forced that interception and the last Drive that time crashing down on Bouldin before he can get started James white comes in from the window white crows emotion sit there nine they give it to him jets were ready he got hit on the outside Marcus Williams it's a one yard tick up for white God defensively that time Casey Rogers goes with a zone concept so when white got the handoff there was about four Jets just playing their area in the field not mantoman and you can see the quickness of Marcus Williams closed on James light on the fly sweep seven play of the drive this is a third and eight for the Patriots crowd has come alive in this third quarter pretty Pat's the ball steps up pretty block down flag is thrown at the 26 Lorenzo Mauldin the rookie from Louisville got Grady around the ankles holding and converting third downs has been a huge problem for the Patriots today Oh four five now as Malden is going to pick up his fourth sack of the season you can see the hold there on Richardson by stork it's a 44 yard field goal attempt for cost Kowski Allen will hold it and he splits the uprights New England cutting into the lead but the Jets still in front 17 to sips over the past jet 17 Patriot 6 week 16 in the NFL chuckles his squad has done an excellent job defensively against Brady they're down weapons they got thrown Kowski back involved early in this third quarter well he was not featured at all on that last Drive to kick off from God's house Keon Cromartie takes in a Jets we'll have it at the 20 we've got 454 remaining in the third back to MetLife after this the season in a primetime starstudded football and entertainment special NFL honor Saturday February 6 only CBS the Jets are a Maryland from bottoming out at 4 and 12 in 2014 an organizational overhaul by the Jets they are 9 and 5 looking for win number 10 underneath the Chris Ivy and it's a loss on the play after the catch of 5 yards not a high tower over there defensively for New England it's been a big afternoon for Brandon March so this 2 yard touchdown catch in the first half but starting the third quarter three straight completions the crossing route that contested back phobic here and in the 33 yard bomb tremendous adjustment for Marshall on that play and these two guys have never had a chance to play in the playoffs getting closer for them unbridled enthusiasm Fred and Marshalls part of the Showtime inside the NFL clearly said production meeting foreclosures and Boomer Esiason have been tremendous it's made and look at football in an entirely new way as the law Powell picks up 10 yards on the one met by Avon Wilson on the play and Marshall he's really changed his whole routine he said now he's a go to bed at 9:00 p.m. and wake up at 5:00 a.m. kind of guy he doesn't deviate a whole lot from the schedule said Friday night is date night with his wife and he can see how the New York nightlife could affect athletes he said it hasn't affected him at this point of his career in his tenth year getting both the playoffs obviously a huge goal and the Jets playing inspired ball led by Marshall and Fitzpatrick third and five took Patrick loses the football well as three tip Spanish upon it they cannot Jamie Tomlin scoops and scores for the Patriots new L'Engle and looking for a big play and they come up with it they're calling in a fumble but the question is was Fitzpatrick's hand coming forward Tom Brody baby knows all about the Tuck rule well that is so close well did not go forward kind of went sideways out of his hand great job by Collins to convert it while coming forward does he have control nope that's a fumble well I'm knocked out of his hand before his hand can get forward it is sheer getting to him initially Jones on the other side under you well went for it but it was pushed forward after it was knocked out of Fitzpatrick's hands that touch download after reviewing the play the wing on the field is confirmed touchdown for the Patriots Mike Carey our rules expert was watching the play as well what were you looking for there Mike on that Fitzpatrick attempt now the rule is the quarterback has to have firm control the ball when his hand starts forward Daniel Wright on the bunt money here the ball is knocked loose before his hand starts board he's throwing what's called an empty hand the ball goes forward but if after it's already loose fumble on the field great call all right Mike a little slicker the finger at the end for Ryan Fitzpatrick the extra point from Gostkowski is good and the New England Patriots with a huge play in this third quarter to make it a 1713 game 3:21 remaining first time they get to Fitzpatrick all day for their 48th sack of the season but sheered talked about what a brilliant acquisition that was coming over from Cleveland eight sacks now for sheared and just like last week when the Patriots got a strip sack and a fumble return and score by Akeem Hicks Jamie Collins does the trick this time the Jets have only allowed 21 sacks this season second fewest in the league behind st. Louis Rams have given up 18 Patriots number six overall and team defense number six in scoring defense as well now we'll see if that play is the catalyst for the pass trying to lock down the number one seed in the AFC well last week against Tennessee early second quarter Chandler Jones knocking the ball away from Marcus Mariota forcing the fumble at beam Hicks on the recovery in the end zone and the Patriots get the touchdown similar play here with Shearer and Collins doing the work for the Pats we'll see how the Jets respond out they go back to the way they started the game with an effective rushing attack between the tackles riddling in now where the Jets know Chris Ivory got it off to literally through the middle for a twoyard pickup Malcolm Brown along with Dante Hightower on the stop the Jets are nine and five they're nine wins have come against teams with a combined record of 43 and 75 they've had the easiest strength of schedule in the league this season second dates in the New York the country puts a pass it's caught by Marshall the Box outclimb Marshall that's 100 catches on the season the 6th time he's done that in his career the first player to achieve that well and Fitzpatrick has so much confidence in Marshall even though Marshall is tightly covered by Logan Ryan Ryan had his back to the quarterback so with Patrick let it fly 10 straight completions now for Fitz 7 catches 95 yards two touchdowns for Marshall and a whistle stops fly with a flag down Marshall jumped offsides and tried to call timeout offense for a 15yard penalty still first down to Marshall here jumps off sides and tries to call timeout nice try so back it up to the 36 yard line for New York first and 15 were under two minutes to go on the third the division that has been dominated by the New England Patriots at one day have seen is 12 times since Tom Brady became the starter in 2002 the law cowl met by Hightower on the play for yard game Jim and Collins also win there for New England foul now was seven carries for 56 yards he's got a couple of catches for 25 more but with ivory less than a hundred percent we'll see a lot more of pal here the rest of this ballgame second and 11 for the Jets and reports one minute to play in the third quarter but Rick Deckard is one catch 25 yards Fitzpatrick it's a taco brought down from behind the chase down by ninka vich 21 yards on the catch and run by Eamonn wah yeah a lot of it was after the catch too wasn't it little out route for a noon wah and they effort at breaking the tackle there that tackle as well and Ning kovitch has to go all the way down the field from his defensive end spot to drag him down Richard's a miss Coleman a miss and a new set of downs for the Jets inside to New England 40 running play with it Steven Ridley forward progress will get him up first down on a 13yard gain Ridley's fired up I think that played by at noon who has fired up this entire Jets offense especially Steven Ridley it's the longest run of the season for the former Patriot Ridley and it's the final play of the third quarter Jennsen Patriots tonight after 60 minutes only CBS brian fitzpatrick 11th straight conclusions we start the full period East Rutherford New Jersey Whitman tries to zig zag and the Patriots turned him down for a loss on the play Malcom Butler first man there Jamie Collins helping out as well last meeting New England rallied in a fourth quarter for the 32:23 victory back in week 7 in Foxborough jazz led that one 17 to 16 entering the fourth they lead this one 17 to 13 Brady getting loose on the Patriots sideline second and 12 to New York now the lease is out of the backfield Fitzpatrick looks the Pensacola's incomplete he was trying to hit Thompkins it's third and long for the Jets I think Thompkins wasn't quite ready for this pass thrown behind him the tight coverage though for Justin Coleman on that play that time the Jets flanked both Marshall and Decker to the same side trying to get the coverage to roll that way and they got what they wanted single coverage but it's Patrick offtarget eighth play of the drive they didn't 12 to New York Patrick the trigger on the Patriots all over it Ken Burrell Thompkins met by Justin Coleman it's a loss of three on the play that's three outstanding plays for the Patriots they tackled by Butler on first down and then the coverage by Coleman on second and then the reaction to read that quick screen to top khun's and Coleman comes up with a big play then it makes the field goal attempt a bit more challenging 49 yard attempt for Bullock trying to extend the chance lead pulling he's got it Brandi Bullock stepping in for Nick full who has done for the year with a quad injury gives the Jets the New England Patriots have won seven straight division titles the Jets have a 20 to 13 lead over New England 13 28 to play in the fourth quarter Brandi Bullock after the 49 yard field goal kicks it off to Keshawn Martin leg strength has never been the question for Bullock it's been accuracy and it's a touch back New England will have it up to 20 here's the playoff picture in the AFC New England in the driver's seat a win and they clinched the number one seed the Jets tied with Kansas City in Pittsburgh Baltimore currently leads the Steelers 13 to 10 Kansas City has got the lead on Cleveland 17 to 10 Houston is up 31 to nothing an opportunity to clinch the AFC South today New England takes over at the 20 they go empty here trailing by seven pretty catch made by Martin tries to break loose of de Mario Davis and he's limited to a four yard pickup through the air but it's another one of those slot receptions for Keshawn Martin filling in for Amendola and also obviously for Julian Edelman but the very familiar type of play to start a drive get some positive momentum going for the Patriots their own touchdown came on the defensive side of the ball with the strip and the scoop and score grading each other in ghost hit from behind by Sheldon Richardson richardson's can overpower the tightend michael williams grady holding on to the ball long time look at 85 working on 91 here as he gets the swim move to the inside and then takes Brady down from behind fifth sack of the season for Sheldon Richardson third and 11 Grady and Trevor forced to throw it Lorenzo Mauldin among those putting the heat on Brady Brandon golden was in the area the Jets dialed up the pressure and it forces New England into a punt bo than coming right up the middle here good little twist moved there with Wilkerson and Brady trying to hang on as long as he can Jacey Rodgers in his first year as a defensive coordinator formerly on the coaching staffs of Miami and Dallas Ryan and punter pipe on sailing truly fair catch at the 30 that's where the Jets will open up this Drive after the 52 yard kick the Jets lead the Patriots 22 night Sunday Night Football on NBC tune in tomorrow football on ESPN Jetson front 22:13 they've got a first in ten at the 31st I dream up the gut and fix up three on the play Malcolm Brown combining with Jamie Collins for the tackle a couple of things suggest are going to be working out on this Drive is to obviously take time off the clock and increase this lead off the seven points that it is now second m7 right in the chest I've been out on eleven minutes to play in the fourth quarter Danny Patrick skies it over the head of Marshall outofbounds now Logan Ryan had great coverage on Marshall that time and fitzpatrick feeling the heat smartly threw it out of bounds little bootleg action for Fitzpatrick but look at this coverage by Ryan he wasn't gonna let that back shoulder throw get to him this time here's a 37 for the Jets Decker vision motion not a lot of targets for Decker here today Fitzpatrick underneath what five Cal but well short of a first down the Jets go three and out it's a twoyard pickup that's the absolute worst thing that Jets could have done the incomplete pass stopped the clock very little time went off the clock now the Patriots should get decent field position to start their next drive does two losses this season for New England back to back to Denver and Philadelphia 12 and 2 record and one win away from securing the number one seed in the AFC quickly the part Keshawn Martin under it from the 16 Martin looking for the outside defeat turns the corner and he's out of bounds across the 30 48yard muppet event each holiday time the Jets with a 20 to 13 lead on the New England Patriots 10:25 left in the fourth quarter Pat's have it at their own 31 yard line he had Brady working out of the gun Brady throws it to Keshawn Martin he is written down there by Calvin Pryor fiveyard gain through the air Center up second half for Tom Brady through his seventh intersection of the season two Darrelle Revis and he's been under constant pressure Renzo Malden with the sack there Richardson with this one and then Malden akin with the pressure forcing the incomplete pass Brady 15 of 19 though for just 167 pull those Corky stats from the England they've been 12 straight week 16 games their last loss was 2002 and it asked the Jets 32:17 2nd and 5 for the Patriots where to go fold and block down on the play by Leonard Williams no gain back in October we all remember the 54th throws that Brady had he could not muster any rushing attack at all against his jet defense if they're going to win this ballgame today they're gonna have to put it in the right hand of Tom Brady they're not going to get anything on the ground against his jet defense third and five Grady dealing with the crowd noise they're all of six on third down conversions crusher again pretty close he's got his man brady swings it to james white for the first out six yard pickup for New England just a beautiful throw on the run under pressure from Wilkerson Brady puts it away from the defender David Harris there what's Wilkerson twice today he's come this close to bringing Kenneth down the drive continues for New England they trail the Jets 22:13 822 to go in the fourth Bouldin single set that shake it gets rid of it incomplete Michael Williams the intended receiver Leonard Williams put the pressure on Brady and forced to throw egg right bird Williams with the pressure immediately nobody there to pick him up Shaq mason doubleteamed on the inside and allowed Williams the free run at the quarterback man remember Josh McDaniels in the Patriots lost Sebastian Vollmer early in this game to a leg injury Sola Adrian Waddell picked up off of waivers from Detroit has seen extended action at the tackle position it's a second and 10 for the Patriots that clocks down to 280 from the guard waiting in complaint flag is down Keshawn Martin the intended receiver the flag thrown at the 49 yard line yeah the fans don't like it buster screen on the real tight coverage apparently too tight you know one call we never see anymore passing fair uncatchable let's check it out 41 and screen on 82 Martin what I'm not sure what the officials saw here maybe that left hand on the shoulder that has to be it good call by the officials turns out to be a nine yard penalty and the ball in jet territory at the 49 first down for the Patriots Stephen Jackson is in they give it to him Jaxon Xavier through the middle for a gain of three Henderson with a tackle for New York that's just that Jackson's fourth carry of the day but the other one that they had success on was right up the middle just like that like Brandon oh this is trouble though this is with Adrian Waddell who replaced Vollmer you were just talking about bird Waddell had a torn ACL last season started 24 games as a member of the Lions will step aside Sarla try to work through some trouble with the left shoulder Cameron is now in for the patriot also justin coleman left the field for new england heading back to the locker room second and seven brittany steps up may be forced to throw it on a bounce near Martin Wilkerson putting the heat on Tom Brady now Wilkerson's getting closer he is affecting the throws though working inside against Mason he goes right by him and forces Brady to throw the ball away again one four seven on third downs for the Patriots so unpatriotic I get report slumming lining up at left tackle third and seven Brady no throw incomplete Martin tried to go downstairs to get it and Brady takes another hit this time Sheldon Richardson yeah absolutely I am the offensive line problems really causing Brady problems now that ball as well thrown as you could possibly throw with this type of pressure they shot from Richardson and then he plants him on the turf Ryan Allen the Punnett from New England 7:32 today trying to place this one and does working that far sideline inside the 10 that's where the Jets will take over they leave by 7:00 on New England between 2001 and 2008 the Jets went through a stretch where they lost eight straight home games to New England three and three over the last six since 2009 they've got a twenty two thirteen laid open up this drive at their own fiveyard line this ivory will pick up two yards inside Jamie Collins where the tackle along with Malcolm Brown over the year 60 minutes has reported a lot of mob stories watch some of the most memorable on a special edition of 60 minutes tonight only CBS just over seven minutes to play ivory nine carries 32 yards Powell the leading rusher seven carries for 56 yards Ridley has 36 yards on the ground just ago empty here shotgun formation forfeit Patrick Fitzpatrick mexic too high for Tonkinese it'll be third and eight for New York let's check in with Evan Washburn well guys the focus for let Adrian Waddell seems to be that left shoulder now again it's less seems to be structural more muscular athletic trainers massaging it right now he's been trying to shake it out doesn't seem to be keeping him out of this game long term but he does not have his helmet we'll just have to keep an eye on it it's clear he needs to be comfortable to go in there to protect that blindside and Waddell was in the game plan they were going to spot him at times on this offensive line but then he was forced into action because of the injury the vulner third and eight and Fitzpatrick get it to Marshall here the town pops it up and rolls to the sideline out of bounds yeah but where he fumbled it it's not going to be in first down to bring it this ball back it'll be inside the 15 yard line and Thompkins is down for the Jets Jamie Collins made the play defensively on Powell in the field lift forward Adam Browns to bring it back to the spine the fumble which is the 11 yard line it rings up fourth down so it's well short of the first down the law Powell is also down on the play so it's Thompkins and Powell Brown a tough childhood and Tompkins has been resilient making it to the NFL now for the Jets fourth down quickly to punnets standing in his own end zone and Keshawn Martin awaits the punt at the Patriots 46:37 ago no lust from New England good putt from Quigley that there is room for Martin to work Martin next up bottled up shy of the 35 it's a 57yard punt and only four yards on the return AFC wild card fixture Kansas City Pittsburgh and the Jets all entered week 16 at nine and five the Cleveland Kansas City game has gotten a bit tighter 1713 the Chiefs in front Baltimore is now up 20 to 10 on Pittsburgh both of those games in the fourth quarter amazing defense by Baltimore to hold that Pittsburgh offense down at just 10 points now Larry and Ronald remains on the new england sideline Brandon pulled into the backfield Patriots take over after a 34 yard line Brady there by building the Jets will prepare Leonard Williams JB Bart Scott NFL today update here's the play you guys we're talking about bug Allen takes it in for the 3 yard score wall our plan with a lot of grit Baltimore least 2010 KC is in in Pittsburgh losses we'll see what happens back to iron Dan and Evan are God's Lakes for lunch jets 20 Patriots 13 we are under six minutes to play second and 9 for New England ladies set us in thrillers he's got Norton open as he runs away from Marcus Williams there was three receivers on that side and a bunch package Martin came from the outside got a little bit of a rub from Gronkowski who was wide open over the middle Steve ajaxy a single setback six patches for Martin 65 yards that's a woman playful Jackson Jackson strong run into jets territory at the 46 picks up seven yards met by Marcus Gilchrist then familiarity with Josh McDaniels terminology and offense really paying off for Steven Jackson he's getting a lot more action and I'm sure that he anticipated that scares for 16 rights third among active players behind Franklin rushing yards Jackson again it'll be short could not get to the marker Williams and Harris help make sure of it now this is going to be another third down where the Patriots have struggled today but I wouldn't be surprised to see Brady go for a quarterback sneak they're just 1 out of 8 which is unheard of for a team that's second best in the NFL at 43% and those sneak from the shotgun formation for no idea greatings incomplete intended receiver Brandon Bolden David Harris with the coverage and it's fourth down and the offense staying out so obviously the tick has decided to go for it looks like Brady kind of hesitated on that throw waiting for the receiver to clear considering where they are no man's land this is the place in New England on a Fulton one inside the Jets 45 the way they're looking for a timeout and they'll get it Belichick came running out of the field to make sure the official saw on the alien takes its first timeout this is the 30second timeout coming up subway postgame show JB Toni bark boomer coach Cowher latest NFL scores and highlights all coming up on the subway folks game show Belichick wisely calling that timeout confusion with Gronkowski and golden on the outside there but if I'm in that huddle I'm expecting Gronkowski to find a way to get open here is their most dangerous player and in Tom Brady's mind the most valuable player on this offense two catches for 52 yards today for Gronkowski this is a fourth and long for the Patriots working out of the gun pretty puts the past Gronkowski for the first down against the safety prior they convert now the thing about Gronkowski is he's a long Strider so within three steps he's already got separation from the defense prior doing his best to get him down and out of bounds but a huge fourth down conversion you applying for OC jumps offensive coordinator maybe a near future now it might be available some places if you had to walk you can take it in a heartbeat first and ten at the 36 handout Jackson gets blasted to Mario Davis reads it it's a loss of three on the play watch to Mario Davis here with a clean shot nobody Bloxom runs right through the hole Jackson's got no chance so back it up to the 39 yard line and a second and 13 we approach three minutes to play on the four Jets lead the Patriots by seven Brady a deep drive flips it to Keshawn Martin and a clean catch at the 35 yard line sets up third down four yard pickup Richardson and Davis putting the pressure on Brady and that pressure is making Brady uncomfortable not really stepping into his throws coming up a little bit low and a little bit short because of that constant pressure 39 white Flint's pretty brainy steps rifles looking endzone and overshoots Keshawn Martin its fourth down Williams and friar back there defensively for the Jets and now the question is on fourth down you tried the field goal here where do you go for it another jet is injured on the play look like it Demario Davis double coverage here by the Jets in the secondary on Keshawn Martin Dan it's Lorenzo Mauldin who's down and the medical staff has come out to check on the rookie Maldon up on his feet and its fourth and nine for doing whoa they need to get to the 26yard line white sets up on the outside shotgun for pretty pretty come to Kentucky doesn't go down on first contact huge grab for the Pro Bowler it looked a lot like Mark Vivaro after the cats didn't he coverage by Marcus Williams and the speed of Gronkowski he runs right by him and then the big hit from Calvin Pryor can't bring him down it takes a village this is the twominute warning 26 yard clutch hookup and we've hit the twominute warning on fourth down its first and goal for New England Patriots looking for the equalizer pretty steps up over the middle yard open James right touchdown Patriots and Jets fans have seen this movie before 11 plays 66 yards gritty leaves New England down the field and an extra point away from tying it up just a tremendous move by James White still no jet within the picture no pressure on Brady perfect strike Gronkowski who got them down here was covered by Cromartie on the outside nobody covered white that's for Bank Gostkowski it's good it was high but he drills it we are tied at 20 Tom Brady 481 career touchdowns including the playoffs that's the most with one team tying Brett Favre for that mark well with just so many weapons that spread out over the entire field Grady with time to look over the defense and find it nobody on James White rob gronkowski had a couple of huge catches on that drive and the but he's going to miss on the attempted Chuck here watch what Harris come over he misses and white walks into the end zone it's the first limo season for the Jets in five years but they need victories in order to make the playoffs and help fitzpatrick off play action LaRon Fitzpatrick takes a shot as he crosses the 25yard line from Dante Hightower six yard run for Fitzpatrick and now they're in a hurry the last two possessions the Jets took virtually no time off the clock at all that allowed the Patriots get back into it second in four from New York a minute and a half to go in the fourth Fitzpatrick incomplete and it was the old nemesis for Fitzpatrick Rob Minkoff itch now nigga bitch lines up as a middle linebacker on this play and he's just going to read the eyes of Fitzpatrick it's right in the throwing lane and gets up in the air and uses his head the England still has to time the hustle head Jets have to be careful here as well with a minute 25 to play in the fourth it's a third and four shotgun Fitzpatrick throws complete and a flag down Eric Decker the intended receiver covered by the Pro Bowler Malcom Butler that's going to be pass interference against the Patriots but they're right on the back of Decker if it is it's the first penalty of the day for New England pass interference defense yeah he's grabbing Dekker before the Cabal gets there that call by the officials 7 yard penalty automatic first down Charlie get a randy pullen in the field always bullet tip the 40 wide table last week 36 seconds left to give the Jets for Hannah to down the path with out of the pocket play it's complete to Decker out near midfield 16 yards on the pass play good blocking from JA Kamini up front to create a little extra time for Fitzpatrick they'll use a timeout yeah I got Fitzpatrick to the outside where it's very dangerous watch Jon Kamini left side of the screen here seals off the inside was blocking sheared to the ground now Fitzpatrick on the move Decker wide open out to midfield right now they would need 20 yards to give Bullock a 50yard field goal attempt coming up Subway postgame show JV Tony Vaughn Pullman coach coward scores and highlights around the NFL all coming up on the subway postgame show we've got 1:06 to play here in the fourth quarter the Jets and Patriots are tied at 20 first down at the Jets 49 from the gun fitzpatrick engine trouble gets out of it patrick try to create down the field it's incomplete it was offline Bilal Powell in the area for New York it shows you just how versatile for the Patriots that Jamie Collins is he had pal single coverage on the outside it was all over him forcing that throw to sail out of bounds by Fitzpatrick the margin of error so soon for this GX team at 9 + 5 + tourniquet spatzle darks one underneath Pal will pick up two yards into New England territory at the 49 we're down to 46 seconds remaining a great hustle by Dante Hightower playing with a bad knee and a spouse and behind it's a 38 and a timeout called you wanted to wiggle it second time out this is the 30second timeout again it's called from the sidelines Belichick did not like what he saw as defense as they aligned against the Jets formation Patriots with one timeout remaining here's the scenario for the Jets tied with Kansas City in Pittsburgh at nine and five the Chiefs lead the brown 17 to 13 in the fourth quarter Baltimore's lead over Pittsburgh is three in the fourth the Jets need wins and they need somebody else to come through for them to knock off either Pittsburgh Kansas City or Denver in order to put themselves in position for a playoff spot now first down here for the Jets would just about put them in position for a field goal attempt bollocks clearly on is 55yard to kick that last season as a member of the Texas and Brandon Marshall has been off the quiet as of late he's got single coverage at the bottom of the screen 37 seconds left third and eight for the Jets Fitzpatrick steps up throws complete in nunya the intended receiver in its fourth down beautiful throw by Fitzpatrick and then trying to get behind Jordan Richards here ball came quicker than he expected just inexperience and the noon was part there that wouldn't have been a touchdown at worst field goal range now the Jets have to punt on fourth and eight in none would just look to be a little late extending his hands 33 seconds left no angle we'll have one timeout and a flag down five yards till fourth down so back it up five yards tied at 20 Brian Quigley will kick it the Patriots have nobody deep New England and why would do England take its final timeout with 33 seconds left apparently they're lining up to go for the block here that 11 men that were lined up right at the line of scrimmage there 33 seconds left Patriots would have had a timeout in their back pocket and this is similar to the way the first half ended with the Patriots deciding just to let the ball run the ball clock out and go to halftime and the mentality here send the house at Ryan Quigley but now they're out of timeouts Doron Hartmann is standing at the 41 yard line Quigley gets basically a free kick trying to place it and cannot so the Patriots will have it at the 20 yard line they've got 25 seconds left it's a 54yard punt but a net of just 34 yeah a bad punt by Quigley nobody back there he could have just hit a little low line drive and let the ball die inside the 10 he goes through with a full kick and the ball easily reaches the end zone and him and Bobby April the special teams coordinator having a chat that's a monologue to over time' Brady takes the knee and we are heading to ot Jets were in a similar spot against the New York Giants just a few weeks ago went to overtime and got the victory here at MetLife Jets were actually the road team in that matchup and that game was also you guessed it 22:20 at the end of regulation this is the end of regulation so we'll keep it here for the coin toss but at the Jets at nine and five two Patriots at 12 and to New England banged up dealing with injuries coming into this game they're gonna come out of this game with more trouble Sebastian Vollmer going down Waddell having shoulder trouble they lost Justin Coleman to a head injury and the pass rush to the Jets although they haven't sacked Brady all that often this afternoon they've especially since those injuries he just talked about to that offensive line they have pressures been on Brady's been off target uncharacteristically all right gentlemen overtime period there's a situation we're gonna play up to one 15minute period both teams are going to have an opportunity to possess the ball unless the often scores a touchdown or the defense scores during the initial possession okay both teams are gonna have two timeouts and all replays will be initiated upstairs in the replay efficient good good okay doing a near the visiting team again the Eagles site is heads the T site is tails he goes his head's T Titans tails it's heads is the call heads is the call it is heads Kim you wanna kick which where you ever seen what do you want to repeat that that way okay just like this the winner wins a toss they elected to kick wait a second here that wait a second there Matthew Staton good luck young waitress elect to kick in his heads we want to kick Oh for anyone receive it that way okay just like this weenie wins the toss they elected to kick butt early bazaar but you know a beginning of every game when the Patriots win the toss they always defer so you think it's a muscle memory well it could be but the other thing there is that Blakeman said you want to kick before the Patriots it we want to kick so he talked him into it I think I think Slater was ready to change his mind Blakeman said you already said that's not a kick but I think Blankman said you want to kick first the Jets if they score a touchdown they win the game that's simple Gus Kowski kicks it off to Crowe morning Jets will have it at the 20yard line Blakeman came over to talk to Bill Belichick it was a very brief conversation you think back to Thanksgiving Detroit and Pittsburgh and Phil Luckett and Jerome Bettis and everybody looking around wait a second what and that's what we've changed the rule as you make the call before the button that coin goes in the air first down for the Jets at their own 20yard line I agree in the backfield they toss a tour trying to dish out some punishment and he did Jordan Richards over there and a little bit slow to get up as he picks up two yards on the play yeah that could be a shoulder injury there as he went low on ivory having trouble with that left arm right now and a lot of pain tavon wilson will step in there already down Patrick Chung Devin McCourty neither made the trip McCourty missing his second straight game with an ankle injury Chung suffered what appeared to be a hip injury last week he's been listed with a foot injury this week on the injury report are you ready to go through the playoff scenarios this game ends in a tie well the Jets lose a lot of the tie breakers this could be as good as a win if they got the tie you know the other thing is why don't we play it out why do we have ties in the NFL but we're not there yet damn it's 14:47 to go in OT I'm just playing devil's advocate here you're speculating on your emojis hate ties okay I hate to worm it I hate to watch that's true game ends you take your tie you're talking you want milk an event per second and eight for the Jets just underway in overtime tied at 20 Decker tears ignore see two catches for Decker the catcher throws whatever makes a move up field that is kept down from behind chunks of yards fortyeight of them well he gets help on the outside as Hopkins came to the inside with a little rubber out there but the noon while making up for not making a catch moments ago makes a big play there to get the Jets in field goal range from the New England 30 handed on ivory loses the ball and recovers it three three and a half yard game the Pittsburgh Steelers have lost in Baltimore they fall the nine and six on the season Kansas City gets the win over Cleveland the Chiefs are 10 and 5 a win for the Jets would put them a game in front of the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Jets will control their own destiny with a matchup in buffalo against Rex Ryan in the bills next game business to take up here though Marshall makin another catch in a crowd doubleteam coming over too late is Harmon running left throwing down the field on target by Fitzpatrick first and goal from the six a touchdown is a gamer in overtime Fitzpatrick Eric Decker holds it in the Jets win in overtime now the Jets got good news with Pittsburgh losing then they make good news of their own Decker gets behind Butler and Fitzpatrick right on target again three for three on the drive for 74 yards and a game winner an eruption in East Rutherford good night a coin toss will be a big part of the storyline unbelievable every week there's a chance you'll see something that you've never seen before in this league that one",

  "transcript": "local station you're watching the NFL on CBS home of Super Bowl 50 puts a pass got curly to the touchdown and a yes take the lead brainy overthetop he's headed touchdown Patriots NFL on CBS getting ready for secondhalf action the Patriots in front of the Jets 13 to 10 and now who are you loving presented by McDonald's David Andrews this Center creating some space Brady didn't really need it because he went airborne Brady the touchdown rushing on the sneak and a tightwad here in Foxborough hi everybody hi on Eagle along with Dan Fouts Jets were dominating the clock throughout most of that first half Brady finally able to get into a rhythm with this New England offense but not a lot of balance on other side the running game has not been a factor for either team yeah and for the Jets they come in as the best rushing team in the NFL and 146 yards per game but when your quarterback your leading rusher your backup running back is ahead of you're number one guy in Chris Ivory now these stats will not hold up against this New England defense and you go back to the very first running play and very first play the game for the Jets something happened to the left leg of Chris Ivory as he is going to give himself up on this play loose four yards and then go to the sidelines try to warm up and get work from the trainer's on the back of that left leg but he's a tough guy I wouldn't be surprised to see him in the second half New England will get the football to start this second half and they lead at 13 to 10 over the Jets Patriots trying to remain undefeated one of five undefeated teams left in the league Cincinnati Denver Green Bay and Carolina the others New England 76 straight home wins when leading at halftime have to go back to 2000 December against Miami the last loss Nick Volk will kick it off second half is underway from Gillette Stadium and in Dola with her man from the one is attached the 25 the djinns ended up with a football on that way they're marking him down though the official coming in pointing at the ground so New England will open up just shy of the 30yard line here's the dive by Amendola he's down before the ball comes out good job by the officials Malden ended up with the ball after this play was wishing Ben and Amendola was clearly down so a first down from the 29 James White near the backfield gravy to throw it on first down down cows T trying to stretch out but he didn't lay out and it's incomplete it's a touch pass by Brady it's maybe three inches too far as Gronkowski gets behind Lattimore and he might have gone the distance here because he had very few jets in his way clear separation for Gronkowski bouncing off the tackle and takes it across the 35 Davis whiffed initially read this there to help out as we send it down to Evan Washburn well guys Chris Ivery was the last Jets player out of the locker room out of the field I spoke with Todd Bowles and he admitted he is sore but he also said that they need to open up some holes with them so we're going to keep going with them here in the second half we'll just have to keep a close eye on him and ask for Bill Belichick he said it all came down to third downs well this is a third and two now the ball so that take on task you can go in motion got play clock down to four Brady get upstairs it's caught setting it up for Scott Chandler a big target at 67 260 pounds in a matchup with Pryor who came away Olympic yeah they're back to getting the ball to Chandler a little bit couple of power forwards here an adjustment by Kendall Patriots moving quickly and Angola the curl after the catch but the play was whistled down Jets called timeout Calvin fryer is hurt yeah he's down on the ground could not get up didn't get off the field either training staffs comes over to check on fryer this we'll find out through the injury another part just do not call timeout it's an injury timeout so that point ever happened for New England here's Pryor right here number 25 making the officials to call timeout I can't put any weight on that left leg six tackles today left the game briefly in the first half and he talked about the lack of depth at the safety position eye on it's Deon Bailey and that's it now he's up against Scott Chandler on this jump ball and watch as they come down Chandler goes about 260 is going to come down and watch that left knee not sure if he just landed awkwardly or Chandler leaned in on him but prior has limped off the field Deon Bailey in a second year from USC former member of the Seattle practice squad and active roster an undrafted free agent is in person tent inside the Jets Porter LeGarrette Blount slides through for a gain of a yard and a half Marcus Gilchrist in on that stop along with Sheldon Richardson for New York now this run defense of the Jets which came into the game is the second best in the NFL doing a good job on Blount so far just two carries for four yards but I would expect to see him a lot more active in here in the second half now it's James White in there behind Brady on second and nine make it Brady the toss to Thompson Aaron Thompson has attempted to enter the season second round pick out a Marshall a couple of years ago I took 12 yard hook up and a new set of downs for the Pats well Leonard Williams a little late now getting to Grady as Brady gets that ball out quickly he has now hit eight different receivers as he's spreading it around as the future halloffamer seems to always do from the gun greater gets rid of it it's channel again Marcus Gilchrist holding on for dear life the Jets have not given up a point in the third quarter this season they've outscored their opponents 34 to nothing in the third 68 to 21 in the second half of games Patriots are threatening inside the Jets 20 they've got a 1310 lead against New York white flanks Brady on a second and two Brady nobody there Edelman the closest receiver in the general vicinity and the Jets put good pressure on Brady on this one and he was not comfortable knowing he didn't want to force that one against Darrelle Revis to Edelman you see how quickly he gets rid of this ball and just throws it away Rivas with good coverage on Edelman it's been a quiet day so far for Darrelle Revis three interceptions this season three fumble recoveries this is a third and two now the Patriots first drive of the second half out of the gun waiting perfectly place to light for the first down it's just pitch and catch for Tom Brady Calvin pace over there trying to deal with white yeah it's just a wheel route that time and you can see how Calvin pace gets caught up inside Cromartie a little bit late recognizing grady recognized it that's the matchup he wanted first and goal mouth for New England Patriots gonna add to their lead grading over the head of Ron Kowski incomplete in a matchup with Gilchrist one of the Jets been doing with Gronkowski different looks well if this is the first time that I've seen Gilchrist on Gronkowski and he's got perfect coverage to that time and Brady again airmails his big tight ends couple times now on the fade route that he hasn't quite given him a chance to go over the shorter defensive backs of the Jets a touchdown on a field goal today for New England in the red zone second a roll for the pass anyone in motion parading in the pocket settles in now to the end zone it's over the head of cop sir the third and goal now for New England Antonio Cromartie does a great job in coverage on this play against Dobson follows him to the post and then back to the corner and Grady feeling the pressure from Calvin Pace got rid of it out of the back of the end zone 40 plays on offense 35 passes for the Patriots we go 13 vote for New England Brady whooping go pop free from Edelman this is just another drop pass Tom Brady's been victimized by his receivers today this is a touchdown pass to Edelman right through his arms he got inside of Revis normally automatic nine drops by Patriot receivers today Wow and another field goal attempt for gust Kowski its twenty three in a row made for the 10year veteran that's what's the uprights Patriots go in front 16 to 10 with 1110 to play before New England 16 the Jets 10 11 plays 65 yards to open up this second half for the New England offense who's awaiting the kick the last three drives for the Jets have all been three and outs New England has made some defensive adjustments and the Jets have not had answers they're going to open up from the 20yard line field position hasn't helped them either back to Foxborough with more of Jets and Patriots right after this dan this is a band that is moving up the charts fade to black a special performance in Providence last night that's our crew the musical stylings I thought the lead guitarist is eric clapton it's not it was clapped a desk if it first content for the chaps they the blacks a good idea Cumberland and Davis to cut ends ivory trying to get to the outside the stiff one he's not the same guy right now now he has no speed no explosion remember it's his left leg so he couldn't really plant and cut powerfully up the field he's got the edge right here but pulls away from Collins but just not the same ivory now brought down by Malcolm Butler on the play it's a threeyard pickup ivory has been limited to 15 yards on the ground Brenda Marshall by the way just one catch covering 13 yards second and seven Fitzpatrick knock down again rob minkoff itch four times today three in the first half and he starts the second half out snuffing this one with his right hand talk about an athletic move we've seen this all day from Nick Nick ovitch frustrating Ryan Fitzpatrick you're there you're in the pocket you got time to throw you got your receivers open and let it go and it comes right back Lumia not fun that's Robert Parish like four blocks for an Enka vich matumbo or that 37 let's walk down the one the Patrick makes the connection and it is enough for a first down hooks up with Devin Smith the rookie out of Ohio State to move the chains for New York yeah big play on both ends of this watch Fitzpatrick hang in the pocket here as he's going to get hit by three Patriots but he is by falling Smith over the middle Smith makes the catch leans forward to pick up the first down first first down and adjust the last for Drive sack Stacy gets the call gain of four Chandler Jones getting Stacy down low first half of the sessions for the Jets the fumble on the opening drive they answered with a field goal then the long touchdown drive punt punt punt to end the first half they had two long drives after the initial fumble by Fitzpatrick but then the Patriot defense putting pressure on Fitzpatrick and no running attack for the Jets Ivory's ambasada on their exact Stacy getting his opportunity ivory less than a hundred percent second and 61920 to go in the third Stacy takes a pitch for progress we'll get a mountaineer the 35 Allen branch that's a big man six six 354 New England that's more than a branch that's an entire tree that's a forest you run up and me there huh but I'm sorry I couldn't see the forest though because branch was in the way lowhanging fruit on that tree third and five of New York Brandon Marshall shifts out of the backfield can they get Marshall in quality katako looking first down a strike from fitzpatrick 13 yards a good call bird here's marcin working in the slot if it's patrick eyeballing him the entire way as he goes right around Logan Bryan for a huge third down conversion for New York three targets two catches for Marshall four straight 100yard games for Brandon Marshall the first jet to do that since halloffamer Don Maynard I was back here and I have a good effort to cross into New England territory for a threeyard pickup chugging the first man there for the Patriots well it's super Monday on CBS beginning with TV's number one comedy The Big Bang Theory followed by the premiere of Supergirl then stay tuned for the super geniuses of scorpion it's an allnew Super Monday tomorrow on CBS line of scrimmage is the 49 of the Patriots clock is rolling 7 22 and Counting left in the third quarter eighth play of the drive take it since Patrick on the wall and the connection made Jeremy Kerley who scored the chin touchdown earlier driven down by Justin Coleman the rookie out of Tennessee that one covers 10 yard to the first down I think Coleman gets away with a late hint here to Curley was way out of bounds when he was tossed to the ground but it was in the patriot sideline in there fence area but look how far Curly's out of bounds when he gets roughed up Ryan Fitzpatrick back in the New England area at the college at Harvard actually wanted to go to Paris K to go up and Goldwyn Arizona they were not interested into services thriving inside just short of the 35 that's a threeyard pickup JB at Bart Scott NFL today update Eric Berry with the big one Eric Berry has it you know the ball is going to be tipped here by Antonio Brown he's going to make a great diving Texas first intercept this has been back that led to a Sark and request 1 yard touchdown run Kansas City up 16 to 3 late in the third back to ion and dance Ben Roethlisberger hoping to get back in there next night it is the Steelers and the Cincinnati Bengals in Pittsburgh thing is watching that game today second and seven potential out of a conference flag took a shot fitzpatrick with three flags down on the play and we got offsetting penalties here holding in the second area against the Pat Patriots and holding against the Jets officials come together to sort it out just under six minutes to play now in the third quarter they're three files on the play two on the defense one in the offense the illegal hands on the face defense over 21 holding defense number 21 holding offense number 74 Henley's offset replay second down well I was two for the price of one for Malcom Butler it doesn't matter the hole called against was it Nick Mangold I'm not sure it was Nick mango right in the middle you're just not used to saying holding on mangled if he known that there was two on Butler he might have gone for a second one himself sixtime Pro Bowler an elite center one on the leaders on this jet squad this offense Awana can really come together nicely Ferguson Park murder mango Cologne and Ja Kamini winter stepped in when cologne was down with an injury tenth play of the drive in a second at seven fitzpatrick nelson in completely little high for eric decker now come Butler in coverage yeah the timing was just a little bit off Decker barely had time to get his head around on this hook route and Fitzpatrick lets it go you can see how far it is to the receiver before Decker can get turned around and make an effort to make the catch we asked what learn what he learned from Darrelle Revis last year he said no doubt the preparation of film study but the biggest moment came early in training camp he was battling Edelman and he won the rep and Revis came over and told them you have the skills to play in this league Butler already believed it but it validated things for him at that point third and seven Fitzpatrick's Wujek down he's got dhikr first down New York Ryan Fitzpatrick on the money you know they talk about the lack of arm strength for Fitzpatrick watch this arm straight little side arms shot right on the money between defenders great catch by Decker's he absorbs the big hit but what a throw on a line by Fitzpatrick good for 24 first down for the Jets jesh lot of the 13yard line we hit five minutes to play in the third 16 to 10 ivory comes down in this way instead spins across the 10 and easily was the one applying that pressure it's a four yard pickup fitzpatrick on the day a hundred 81 yards a touchdown brady 186 and a rushing touchdown but ivory has given that just just what they need I don't think he's going to be effective running wide but between the tackles were so effective he's still getting yardage on 1st down 13th play of the drive for 20 remaining in the third quarter second and six from the 9 Fitzpatrick bosses out on the breeze not the angle touchdown Jets Ryan Fitzpatrick the toss to ivory good hands from the running back and he turns it up for the score in the Jets with a chance to take the lead first receiving touchdown for ivory as he makes a super catch running away from the quarterback and reaching back to snag this one that's a heck of a grab by a running back he walks into the end zone nobody accounted for Chris Ivory defensively that Nick folk is on for the extra point ivory may not be a hundred percent but the effort will always be there 13 plays 80 yards for the lead folks got it and at 1716 Jess Chris Ivery getting involved through the air the Jets go in front now Eric Decker is a pass receiver but on this play he's a pass blocker watch him come in and block ninka pitch as ivory comes out of the backfield Minka pitches in coverage with ivory he's got no shot because Decker puts one right under his chin and I was gonna walk in Chris Ivory nine yard touchdown reception his first catch of the day his first touchdown catch of the season Jets 17 Patriots 16 and that's how big the Jets defenseless last time that Grady had the ball holding the Patriots just that field goal now with the touchdown they got the onepoint lead avid Ola is deep waiting for the big room a developer takes it out across the 20s shut down there by Riley next for MacDougall helping on special teams Patriots have the football but they're down one at home against the Jets Gillette Stadium opened in 2002 so many memorable moments from this Patriot team inside this venue 30 miles outside of Boston 25 miles north of Providence it's a first content for New England at its own 22 yard line motion man is having Dulla working out of the gun Brady throws he's got Rob Gronkowski along that sideline Antoniou Cromartie brings him down Brady came in the game is a 70% passer but his receivers have led him down today nine drops on the afternoon pour from Brandon LaFell oh he has one Pat Edelman will drop a crucial one here at Grytviken a touchdown and to a field goal for the Patriots but Brady 18 of 34 today read up it's a 5 receiver shed year for New England got not three by Richardson of the patrons come up with him Brady was trying to load this one up to throw it deep look at this play by Richardson as he's hunting him from behind gets the right hand in to knock the ball out and Brady wisely sees the ball kicked over to him and makes the grab we asked him does Brady trashtalk with you he said once he actually gave me praise said it was a nice play I thought he was playing mind games with me after he made a play in a previous matchup definitely playing mind games second and nine quick hitter Ranelagh fell across the 40 felt today update JB hard Scott Pittsburgh within striking distance Landry Jones is going to hit his favorite target martavis Bryant with a 19 yard score as Pittsburgh narrows to lead 1610 118 a left in the third back to ioan eagle and Dan Fouts to an irish weapons on that Pittsburgh offense Andy Jones trying to strip the rally drop ball LaFell on a third and three Brandon LaFell having a tough time and his return to the lineup his fifth drop of the day and this is a team that converts 50% of the time coming into today's game and today struggling because of these drops just 4 of 12 number one in the NFL in that category entering action at 51% on third downs not every third down as equal as we know go to George spirited walls line element trilling not about once again the Jets is deep in their own territory a 47yard punt Matthew Slater's not a hundred percent but got down the field on special teams for Bill Belichick and company back on October 6th a current former Patriot players were among the more than 200 volunteers who helped build a new playground at Children's Services of Roxbury the 2,400 square foot playground includes a triple racer slide tictactoe activity board rock climber and more all part of the initiative around the NFL and from the Patriots in this community Robert Kraft chairman CEO of the Pats at native Brookline Massachusetts so we know how much it means to him the kind of impact that this franchise has had in this area you walk into this stadium where they've built and incredible building combined with shopping restaurants the kingdom it's a kingdom the kingdom of crafts beautiful let's take over first down to Chris Ivery powers across the 20yard line that's a three and a half yard gain Akeem Hicks over there defensively for New England so we have under two minutes to go in this third quarter the Jets lead the Patriots 17 to 16 ivory appears to be getting stronger as the game is going on and with these short runs three four yards are doing for the Jets taking time off the clock but they're also setting up the playaction passing the bootlegs for Fitzpatrick 14 carries 29 yards a touchdown illustrator for ivory sheet at the ivory of the middle he fixed the right spot and ivory has enough for a first out he's displaying some pretty good patience right now he talked to us a little bit about his style of running last night where he talked about how he wants to press the hole but also be patient enough and when he's patient he allows the offensive lineman to get on the linebackers because the patient's a little stutter there draws the linebackers up closer to the offensive lineman having his best season as a ploy gave credit also to running back Coke's Marcel he said he played the game so he brings the perspective of having done it on the field take it the catcher on time and finally Russell does now Fitzpatrick fakes the ball to ivory and now Marshall working against Ryan over the middle Logan Ryan that is this is where Marshalls so dangerous and knowing how important it is to not turn the ball over as Ryan tries to poke it out with his left hand Ryan has been up and down in his first two years in the league now in a starting role for New England with the injury to Terrell brown he's done for the season placed on IR with an injured foot end of 3 1716 the Jets in front of the Patriots back to Foxborough after this this is the NFL on CBS we start the fourth quarter the Patriots for the first time this season trailing in the fourth first and ten for the Jets in New England territory Decker demotion man take it the faster country share than the legs down fear so he scampers an outofbalance flag is thrown on the far shot of the field at the 34 that's gonna be holding against the Patriots in the secondary holding defense number 54 fiveyard penalty from the end of the run automatic first down it's Dante Hightower the versatile linebacker for Bill Belichick in Matt Patricia's defensive squad 1716 the Jets in front were just underway in the fourth I&amp;E go Dan Fouts Evan Washburn the rest of our NFL on CBS crew producer mark Wolfe director Bob Fishman and company line of scrimmage is now the 35 doing Piper runs into a crowd that slammed backwards forward progress will give him three Collins and Seeta Linga collaborating on the play defensively ivory who had just 12 yards on nine carries in the first half the second half he's turned things around seven carries so far for 27 yards but he doesn't look a lot better more forceful running with more power between the tackles second and seven now for the Jets 87 rushing yards they came in averaging a hundred 36 per game on the ground good food number one in the NFL on second down fitzpatrick game complete with a flag Decker against Butler now Decker was trying to get back to this back shoulder throw Butler upset because Decker really made the first contact on this play pass interference defense number 21 but foul automatic first down it's gonna turn out to be an 18 yard penalty on Malcom Butler but watch Decker trying to push Butler away that's a tough call but the right arm of Butler is on Decker preventing him from getting to that ball the arm locked him up once he got in front full penalty against New England just two penalties against the Jets first down we aren't on the catch and run for Chris Ivory it's a really good job by rob minkoff it's getting out there in the face of my agreeing forcing ivory to cut upfield to where all the pursuit from the Patriots was coming from another long drive from the Jets this one bridging the third and fourth quarters we've got a onepoint lead a chance to add to it on a second and seven now when canary in territory Clicquot found the one potential timing wrap and the timing is off Eric Decker will alert now Decker was expecting this one to go to the back of the end zone Fitzpatrick wants to throw it back shoulder because of the position of Butler it's a little bit of a miscommunication on the fly there between Decker and Fitzpatrick dime package for New England ain't plan to drive for the Jets will go empty five receiver set on third down touchdown now the Jets are not immune to dropping passes today either this ball perfectly thrown by Fitzpatrick away from the defense to the hands of number 15 and out she goes the adjustment by Marshall Fitzpatrick thought he had six it's a 30yard attempt now for Nick folk thirty yards away he drills it the Jets 20 the Patriots 16 we've got twelve fifty remaining in the fourth aerial coverage of today's action provided by MetLife bird'seye view of Gillette Stadium packed house on a fall Sunday afternoon in New England 22 16 and another close game between these two teams Faulk kicks it off Amendola is deep they'll take a knee Patriots will have it at the 20 yard line well first time that Todd Bowles is going against Bill Belichick as a full time head coach he did go against him as an interim head coach with the Miami Dolphins a number of years ago and now Bowles is a part of this series New England has won eight of the last nine played between the two teams they've won six straight over the Jets at home both teams very disciplined because of those coaches just four penalties against New England today two against the Jets and just one turnover that early Fitzpatrick fumble this was supposed to be the year at least for an NFL of JD's but the Patriots would be challenged in the AFC East it's not necessarily the Jets that everyone thought would be the two challenging Brady it's completed into Amendola really tight coverage that time by Marcus guild Chris but Amendola able to hang on positive play on first down it's up a lot of possibilities on second and short for Tom Brady Buster screen is in there he left late in that second quarter with a shoulder injury he's in as the second and to couch the emotion Brady to throwing steps up in the pocket and he connected to a first down that covers five yards the unbaling stepping into the injured Calvin Pryor who left with an ankle injury was there defensively and you know that on the sidelines that the Patriots Josh McDaniels and Tom Brady knew that this young man would be in there for prior three catches for Edelman 19 yards 20 left in this fourth quarter and one is 16 Jets it's a pitch for blind breaks out of an initial David Harris first man there and then Buster screen helping out in run support for a loss of seven on the fly let's check in with Evan Washburn Evan well God's during that last jets possession it was the first time I saw Tom Brady get up and he had a lot of positive words for his offense in his offensive line sensing the urgency of this Drive obviously the drops that let him down he's still gotta face faith in this group and it's the first time actually saw him get up and really give his offense and positive effect then again that makeshift offensive line because of injuries remember they lost mate soldier finishes with a torn biceps and that force cannon in action and whose hand Ballmer shifts shoulder to the left side second at 17 he skies it to the sideline and a catch by Doozer bowls so the starting offensive line today Vollmer he's a veteran normally plays on the right side Cline has been shifting back and forth Andrews as a rookie Jackson is a rookie Fleming as a secondyear guy at a Stanford a fourth round pick start at 39 games in college but a minimum number that starts here in the pros third and 17 now for New England on a young boy he's got his man downfield it's Edelman heads Dion Bailey to the tune of 27 yards well the pass rush just isn't there it's a fourman rush that they get nowhere near Brady as he fires a strike right down the middle of the Edelman they've run 51 place of the Patriots to 7 rushing plays honest images the 46 of New York and a third and 17 the Patriots convert Topsail motion bringing out of the pocket flips it to Gronkowski 12:1 he's got a first down across the 35 Gronkowski was in pass blocking that time and Tom sees him he tells him to get downfield you can see him making a verbal communication there Wieckowski got the message then he got the ball you know the patience of Brady maybe some other quarterbacks just throw that ball away and move on to second down he knows where all his receivers are even when they're protecting in the pocket without of 9 20 and Counting left in the fourth 22:16 Jets Patriots are on the move at the New York 35 women goes in motion but he looked Orton instead gets Gronkowski chasity carrying Gilchrist it's not fair just the most physically dominant tight end the game has seen in a long time just running a seam wrap Grady fake be passed to Edelman and now it's a free ride for Marcus Gilchrist of at least 10 yards it's like he's trying to Bulldog him down it's a rodeo they don't look like they're of the same species 12 braiding underneath to Gronkowski this time the jets are ready for him in a game tackle to limit grunt Kowski to that'll be second down at the 10 we have this has been three straight completions now Gronkowski we ask run Kowski about Brady he said his work routine is set day in and day out study eat treat your body he's so consistent you have to be followed a signatu along that same exactly Brady each other that's out of it instead of absorbing the second he turns it into a twoyard pickup in sheldon Richardson's slow to get up he can't get up holding his left arm it appears Richardson who just returned from the fourgame suspension back in the mix you played 49 of 63 snaps last week medical staff is checking on the left arm of Richardson step aside biggest test of the season for both of these teams early on Sheldon Richardson leaving the game with a left arm issue Stephen Bowen has gained a place in him this is a third and six for new in their gun Greg Brady for the lead Tom Brady delivers Amendola has having dropped passes today he makes a spectacular catch under some real pressure at the goal line Rainey fires a fastball eyeballing him the whole way here there's the fastball there's the catch Gilchrist will upend him he'll land right on the goal line breaking the plane Grady on the drive found his rhythm seven of eight three of them going to Gronk we asked for any about Amendola he said he's healthy that's the biggest key last week the Patriots show that they could spread it around on offense and it was important for the rest of the league to see that it wasn't just dominated by the likes of Dion Lewis and Rob Gronkowski they are just taking a look at this all scoring plays are reviewed looks like Amendola is in yeah when his left elbow hits that's where the ball should be marked and that's what they're looking at here where is the ball when that elbow hits it appears to be breaking the plane Danny Amendola had seven catches for a hundred five yards last week I think last year when he was struggling he started returning kicks and started getting some long runs on those kickoff returns and it helped him out on offense it spilled over the confidence into his offense touchdown is confirmed the spouse key not through the extra point and New England has got a twenty three to twenty advantage get the forward after catch like this that might take some air out of the ball that's that's a spike Miami has won two of the last three games against New England Brady undefeated as a starting quarterback on Thursdays dolphins are still wearing the same uniforms they just I think changed the bodies in those uniforms where did they put up today 41 whoo New England 23 the checks 20 kick off from kuskowski Ellucian will return it the outside will soon right around the 30yard line is where he is brought down by three neon special teams well on the touchdown here's Amendola and here is Edelman Hill Chris has to choose between the two he will take Edelman and he's late coming back to Amendola at the goal line super catch under pressure and the quarterback happy that Edelman Amendola could make that ground Amendola restructured that contractor in the offseason wanted to stay with this team and that's the reason why the Kevin tree with Brady for the second time today they'll pull back Tommy blower handed on the receiving end of a fitzpatrick pass 13 yards on the play well it's a little bit of a bootleg here's Bohannon he's going to sneak out here and again Fitzpatrick watch how he gives him a nice soft toss here he's so wide open you don't want to lead him too much just put it right on his body this big first down start this Drive doctor there's a motion I got six and a half to play this either leaning forward across the 45 for a four yard pickup Jamie Collins will get credit for the stop Brian Fitzpatrick is 17 of 31 235 yards two touchdowns he didn't lose a fumble on the game's opening possession and he does resemble a nineteenthcentury blacksmith with a beard that he's got working every week it gets more impressive that like the stache summits like the Yosemite Sam you know second and six Fitzpatrick throws to the outside incomplete trying to get it into Cumberland Chung got turned around and still made the play for New England and really a dangerous pass thrown by Fitzpatrick as it's thrown a pic all day but Chung is all over Cumberland if he could have located that ball early it would have been a foot race as Chung gets away with a little Jersey their little Club watching his knee he's watchin the channeling bill after he third and six crowd is energized play clock is down to two low snap Fitzpatrick has a car in complete devin Smith the intended target and Justin Coleman holds off now backtoback great coverage mantoman by this defensive backs of the Patriots first Jung and now Coleman again it's if Fitzpatrick trying to throw the ball the back shoulder instead of firing out and Brendan letting instead of letting the speed of Smith's run it down fourth down Weatherford on with 5:30 to go and every player that crosses the 30 yard line on the return New England's got a threepoint lead they've got the football we've got five 32 to play in Foxborough coming up tonight on 60 minutes the first and only look inside the US and war against Isis plus an interview with Vice President Joe Biden 60 minutes tonight 23 220 the Patriots in front with 532 remaining here in the fourth quarter Patriots have won 19 straight home games played in October Tom Brady no mistakes that's part of this New England offense they're not going to hand it to you Sheldon Richardson is back in their fighter jets defensively the Patriots take over at the 32 Gronkowski right away they feed it to him floor before you are gain on first down Harris and Gilchrist combined to bring down the big tight end and that punt return by Amendola gives the Patriots good place to start this Drive only the Jets and then at 22 yards on that front because it a good return Patriots now have it at the 36 they'll hit the fiveminute mark of the fourth working from the gun Brady it's on time dachshunds seeing more time than the drawers of mo fell and you'll just wonder about the jets pass rush I mean Brady now has thrown 47 passes that has got to wear out any defensive front well we talked about the ankle or injury to prior and how Bailey's come off the field replaced by Marcus Williams so Marcus Williams is in replacing the man who replaced prior there's Freddie the imaginary ladders or crunch down 14 yards on the hookup we had seven catches for 105 last week what that's to spectacular catches in a row for Amendola look at him climb that ladder and know he's going to be bounced on the ground in front of screen man that's a good catch Freddie got shoved down at the end of the play by Harris yeah but he's hot I am eight straight to patients and using clock without a 335 to play fit the rug Brady cope and throw downfield Julian Edelman hit immediately by Cromartie that's an 8 yard pickup for the Patriots Grady over 300 yards passing and look at the touch on this one as he just drops it over the linebacker underneath Edelman sharp cut to the outside in front of Cromartie they're now at the 36 yard line Tom Brady the leading passer so far today in the NFL 22 yards James White get down low white have enough for a first down the clock is at 242 and Counting and the Jets have three timeouts remaining they sack Brady three times in the first half zero sacks here in the second half they've knocked him down a couple of times with Brady's been able to get the ball off it'll read up ready for again 15 left Brady swings it got not three of Michael Williams it was jarred loose by case clock stopped with 2:12 left that was a break for the Jets never miss a moment of football action with a CBS Sports hat every play at score every game every highlight brought as they happen all part of the big Monday super Monday on CBS you can go to the CBS sports app at CBS sports.com slash mobile even Jets on the line of scrimmage on a second attack rating off the hands of LaFell rough afternoon for the veteran Brandon LaFell and spa look like it might have been tipped at the line of scrimmage that ball gets out of spiral so that ball definitely was hit but that's six drops now for LaFell be give a break on that one as one of the Jets got a finger on it but again the clock stops benefiting New York 207 Oh tough to play Brady fun time to levin go up the first down Buster's screen with a temple at Tom Brady's milking the clock coming up big when the Patriots needed most New England trying to ice it against the Jets they've got a threepoint lead with two minutes to play in Foxborough two minutes left in England 23 the Jets 20 and the Patriots with a first intent at the New York 22 and they want to keep pressing trying to get in the end zone to put this one away they don't want do not want us to have to settle for a field goal all three timeout to later pretty has been exclusively in the back and it close to Amendola underneath 70 yards on the catch for Amendola Jess have got to come start calling timeouts though where's the timeout the practice continues to roll it's down to 139 left you have to use your timeouts to force New England Patriots are no rush they'll use every last second of the play clock they can play the first down getting hay with a loss second of three touchdown son of Whitsett Marcus Gilchrist and nobody took Gronkowski Randee saw it all the way it's coming from this side Andre Gronkowski is as wide open as you could possibly be nobody around number 87 It was as if New England invited the Blitz because they knew they had an answer and I'm not sure the Jets could have played that any worse 1:13 would any other clock back to the point from gust house key is good to give New England the 10point lead so the dead still have all three timeouts but don't have a whole lot of time 11 catches today for Gronkowski and this one he almost took his eyes off the ball juicy he couldn't believe he was so wide open probably still can that's 108 yards and a touchdown for Gronkowski you know for it's a tight end to average 18 and a half yards of catch is phenomenal but he can do it with speed and power and attitude how about the fact that New England can beat you in so many different ways on a day where Tom Brady threw the football 54 times and handed it off five times and they rushed for 16 yards and Brady he does it all he's a leading rusher as well 15 yards on the ground for Brady and a rushing touchdown two touchdowns through the air 355 yards were grading 10 more years that he's playing 10 more years why not but here's the thing I just hope I'm around 10 more years to watch it last year he was asked how long he'll play he said 10 years he was asked again this year he said 10 years would it be 9 years but at some point he's got to start doing the math he can adjust nobody adjust better than Tom Brady Jets will have it at the 20 yard line and they're down 10 coming up subway postgame show JB Bart Coomer coach Cowher NFL scores and highlights all coming up on the subway postgame show and that touch now is a classic example of a hot receiver in more ways than one not receiver means when the Blitz comes the receiver looks for the the quick pass from the quarterback and that's exactly what the Patriots got chats are down two scores with a minute 13 worker fitzpatrick 12 brandon marshall three catches 55 yards for Marshall today if you could make any sense out of that these two guys are blitzing Gronkowski says okay go ahead I'm on my way to the endzone and what a great relationship these two have Tom Brady and his offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels they supremely appreciate each other's talents and but numbers as a coordinator as good as anybody's ever done passes to a looser the 40yard line I went running one yards and a timeout used with one minute to play in the fourth Jess will have two timeouts remaining down by ten it's puzzling the lack of the use of the timeouts by the on defense for Todd bulls fell very little height very little fanfare from the Jets side of things heading into this Patriots match that was not the norm under Rex Ryan there was a lot of bluster bulletin board material Jets have been more businesslike in their approach this year it's paid off for not entering action here after taking on a machine that's what the Patriots all right now on low snap fitzpatrick nice grab by Marshall trying to get to the sideline there and out of bounds Logan Ryan in coverage for Tom Brady big numbers again 355 yards and a pair of touchdowns through the air one on the ground injured jet its Nick Mangold medical staff is out checking on a perennial Pro Bowler Jetts will be charged a timeout because of the injury and it looks like he got his leg pinned under Chandler Jones as Jones was being blocked in to him see this so often the backup is Dakota Dozier second year from Furman they now have mangled on his back John melody the trainer is the one underneath Mangold's helmet Oh mangoes number 75 and looks like he 74 rather right in the middle of everything and it looked like his head hit one of the rushing Jamie Collins actually his good sign seeing him sit up now hopefully it's just a stinger he's been so durable throughout his NFL career he and D'Brickashaw Ferguson drafted the same year he took a shot right there and went down in a heap they helped Mangal to his feet and Mangold is taking his time walking towards the Jets sideline fiftyfour seconds to play here in the fourth quarter 3220 Patriots and at some point if it's Patrick is going to have to go deep here I can't afford to waste any time down to their final timeout timeout was taken away from them because of the mangled injury the Kota Dozier is in snapping lefty to Fitzpatrick out of the pocket the moon darks it up field and hooks up with a loose ooh a trick Chun there defensively an elusive slow to get up subway postgame show is coming up JV Bart Boomer coach Cowher scores and highlights all coming up in the subway postgame show Patrick I've been a motor for Zac Stacy and that's good enough for a first down for the Jets 23 seconds left I just don't understand the short throws I mean you got Brandon Marshall you got Eric Decker get two guys that can get up in the air it's time to throw the hill Mary on first down and just keep throwing it you have no time outs left now because of your lack of using them before giving the Patriots the easy touchdown to Gronkowski and now they're gonna bring out the field goal team did Nick folk out there to get three of these points back so that was the philosophy trying to get into field goal range accept the fact that you're gonna have to get a field goal at some point and a touchdown get the field goal and then an regarded kick this is a 50yarder so certainly no gimme here for full a long of 53 this season career long of 56 back in 2010 Purdum will snap it Weatherford is the holder Weatherford had worked in his previous stint with the Jets wit Purdham and full so this was not completely unfamiliar territory when he was on yesterday it was with the chance in 2009 in 2010 15 out of 10 trying to make this a onepossession game you know David Collins is capable of I'll start that's not going to help push it back five now folk looking to the sidelines to see if they want him to try a 55 yarder if indeed it's called a false start well start officer seventyseven five family still SEC till first down hey Jetson reacting to the shift of the Patriots and James Carpenter just flinched and threw the flag before the game full hit a 53 yarder he came up short on a 58 yard attempt this one is from 55 yards away it's a slight breeze behind him too though while the cats have a puncher's chance here and each bulb to convert 23 seconds 55 yards away Knicks hope he nails it it's a 7 point game with 18 seconds left so it'll come down to an onside kick to see if the Jets have some life left in them a perfect snap and hold and how about that kick high and far for Nick Fulton he and Weatherford on the same page and now that Jets will line it up for an onside attempt looking for a miraculous finish here in New England 18 seconds to play they are watching the Patriots walk through yesterday and it's been a lot of time in this type of situation you can see some of the personnel they have out on the field Gronkowski back at the 40yard line Ning kovitch and Hightower in front of him but if the ball comes in that direction both Hightower Nikol Fitch will let it go all the way to Gronkowski we're gonna try the other side of the field both kickers timeout called by the Patriots see both Weatherford and Fokker standing there with the potentially keep this ball Milotic and the Patriots saw the alignment come out and alert their special teams unit to that possibility Vinc Weatherford practice any outside kids on his radio show I don't I don't believe so unless that was in the third segment of the second hour who was working the board I can get that information for you Weatherford hosting a show in New York yesterday and got the call during a break from GM Mike mechag ninh that they needed his services hustled over to the Jets facility and got on the Charter so Weatherford and full are both out there which angle will it come from Weatherford is number three focus number two it will be full marshal of a recovery for New York 15 seconds left and the Jets down by seven a great kick to here by Faulk as he puts this one skipping along the ground tough first hop there for Jamie Collins the ball gets punched down the field and there's Marshall no other Patriot around Edelman late getting over there so is Don Harmon and an easy recovery for Brandon Marshall they have to go 48 yards you think about the lack of use of timeouts when the Jets were on defense and the Patriots scored that easy touchdown fifteen seconds left let's have note down by seven chuck up pitch match in a field Decker with the catch 8 seconds left 7 seconds left Jets trying to get lined up here down to 4 seconds left they spiked it with 1 second left yeah they did and a flag is thrown it's a illegal procedure against the Jets and move it back five yards number 15 was not set full start offense number 15 here's golf in a 10second run huh that's it only Jets win in a frantic mode and they could not rally the AFC still goes through Foxborough the Patriots knocked off the Jets 32:23 New England remains undefeated six and OH on the season the Jets fall to four and to Marshall on the recovery to keep the Jets alive and then Marshall trying to jump back Jets couldn't spike it cleanly would have had one more chance left but the tenth second run off at the end means this one is over New England now two and OH in the division Jets suffered their first loss within the AFC East Buffalo's three and four and the Miami Dolphins try to make it interesting in the division final score from Gillette Stadium the Patriots 30 the Jets 23 for Dan Fouts have been watched during the rest of our clue oh my an eagle from Foxborough coming up next Subway postgame show you've been watching the NFL on CBS homo soup hols 15",

  "transcript": "Alice on Sunday night football night in America with all the weeklong highlights and my conversation with Tony Romo gets things going at 7:00 p.m. Eastern and tonight after this game in Foxborough it's The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon his guests are Andy Samberg and Carrie Underwood plus Jimmy's Tonight Show superlatives with your favorite NFL players and tomorrow night Jimmy's guests include Donald Trump The Tonight Show coming up after your late local news and coming up after this it's the second half from Foxborough and the tenth season of Sunday night football starts right there AT&amp;T Kress we've done a few of those giants and I care where they finish in the standings or where they are in the standings that a lot of memorable games yeah Eli Manning Odell Beckham you know all those guys it's gonna be a lot of fun and I I think this Dallas Cowboys defense may end up being one of the big stories this year they are deep on that defensive line and very athletic and explosive defensive side of the ball the NFC East a very interesting race coming up no question about that with the Philadelphia Eagles we'll see them against Carolina in October the Giants on Sunday night all starts with Carrie Underwood getting us underway 10th season in three nights meanwhile here 14 to 3 New England's on top by 11 and they will get the ball to start the third quarter Scobie line drives that one through the end zone start at the 20 yard line Tom Brady tonight completed his last well he's 15 out of 17 two touchdowns both to Gronkowski who's caught three overall for 41 yards meanwhile the Steelers Roethlisberger 12 of 17 for 166 many of those to Antonio Brown 33 straight games with five or more catches in the AFL record that's every game into the equivalent of more than two seasons rady from the 2000 under the outside elements having a huge night that's a gain of 11 and a first down Julian Edelman his prime target 7 for 71 now this is not how it's supposed to go for the Pittsburgh Steelers tonight defensively even on the first snap after coming out at halftime they still were having trouble getting lined up with what the New England Patriots were done through the middle squirting his way forward for a gain of about four Dion Lewis Tom Brady when he came out about an hour before the game the ovation as you might expect was absolutely rady was going to contribute to get them going a little bit the entire first half I can remember one pass that he missed to any Amendola down the sideline but he was pretty much perfect that first half for a gain of one stop there by Ryan Suze early third down third and four and here's where they need it the Pittsburgh Steelers defensively they need something big to happen here this is when you start looking to that front seven this defensive Bunch is going to be built around the front seven they're young on the back end they're going to make some changes they're going to try and keep it simple you need a sack you need something to happen up front to give this back in a little protection you nice to to get a third down stop here Patriots have converted four or five on this down to make that 5 out of sexist Edelman makes his pitch of the night to move the chains well Edelman has beat him across the formation now he's coming out the other way and beating him so for antoine blake here's a special teams guy that played well in the second half of the season got a chance to come out here and start and got one of the toughest assignments that you can have in the slot Julian Edelman is incredibly difficult to cover 14 straight completions for Tom Brady to the ground big hole exploiting it first down Dion Lewis talked about him earlier a guy who came up with Philadelphia got hurt has not played at all in a regularseason game over the last two years James Harrison came shooting down inside and as shazier tried to come out around on the other side I think that was Trey Jackson that got him and so they're firing some shots now they're just not getting their vote only quickly to the line first time 44 10 inches in the wine country militia gang and Lewis for a gain of 9 to the 35 yard line you mentioned it before question Brady telling us good is Louis could become a cult hero up here yeah no doubt about he's getting some help by this from this offensive line up front Trey Jackson young right guard that time with a good fly and Ola for a first down tackle there by Will Allen one of the things you do to a defense when you sense that there is a bit of confusion as you go faster and nobody can go faster than Tom Brady now when they make some substitutions then the Steelers get a chance to catch their breath Josh Daniel's the offensive coordinator a guy I think by the end of the seasons gonna be a head coach anything we used to be was it been her cuz he learned lay out there came back as an assistant figures to be a head man again Sunday was great he goes deep but there's a flag too in fact as if there was any question portes Allen had to reach out and try to stop him by grabbing them so Cortez Allen takes his shot at Edelman and let's see what happens kind of hooks that hand and doesn't let Edelman get it free I think Edelman was trying to do what we've seen so much you can see the interlocked arm they're sort of had it pin metalman tried to make that onehanded play 28 yard penalty get in on first down open it'll be second down and goal on the opening drive of the second half and they've got a new use for Shaq Mason they're fourthround draft pick a guard he lined up at pull back on that play just went out of the game we really like how athletic Shaq Mason is kind of came from a run oriented offense at Georgia Tech figuring out that pass block Scott Tranter the tight end picked up from Buffalo was it payback now goes into the stop basket goes outside five since in the past o'clock so you put the two big tight ends outside crossing Chandler goes to the outside Gronkowski comes inside and the former Buffalo Bill now in his eighth year Chandler for the touchdown Steelers are being forced now to come up and play tight that you're asking an inside linebacker Lawrence Timmons the cover Scott Chandler and I think this addition of a second receiving tight end remember Scott Chandler with the Buffalo Bills has been a guy that's been one of their leaders if not their leading receiver there and you just sort of harken back to the days when they had Aaron Hernandez here where's Nolan tell that story but when they had the two receiving tight ends they were almost impossible to stop and they're working loves it as a tremendous success with two three tight ends the extra point is good so 1037 remaining in the third quarter and the Patriots move out to a twopoint lead 50 years ago they played one by Green Bay over Kansas City there is the ring that was presented to the Packers and on the right is the ring being worn by the Patriots after the victory last year in Super Bowl xlix price of diamonds about a little bit too tonight twenty one two three they treated trying to repeat a Super Bowl champs it first happened in the first two Super Bowls Bart Starr Vince Lombardi and one and two then he had Miami the second of those was the perfect season Pittsburgh did it twice in the early 70s and then in the late 70s they won four in a decade 49ers did it in the late eighties Jimmie Johnson leading the Cowboys Mike Shanahan John Elway wrote into the sunset with their tube and now the Patriots earlier in this century can they do it again here's to the races past the 40 to the 40 yard line 14 to 28 to start this drive they have had success running the football here tonight just gonna hit it right up in here they've got the doubleteam block going come off on the linebacker good job and I tell you DeAngelo Williams for a guy that maybe Carolina thought had seen his better days and he was out about 10 games last year with an injury lose it's 15 pounds and what's really explosive here tonight he has not been the issue can't you in the league 82 yards on 10 carries tonight Roethlisberger fires open court Brown and he takes you to the 19 yard line so Antonio Brown that's a gain of 33 and quickly deep into Patriot territory some of this protection inside here has been very good picking up that blitz there David on the outside that time got Malcolm Butler Tonio Brown he's a handful Williams cuts it back to the middle I'm Angela Williams taking it to the 15yard line you know I don't think I've seen a team have this many big plays this early in the game it only had three points on the board and it's got to be really frustrating for Mike Tomlin because their game plan is working offensive ly they're going up and down the field they missed field goals they haven't taken advantage and Tom Brady keeps taking advantage of every mistake Pittsburgh makes yeah they're on a pace to gain almost 500 yards tonight already speciously to the two yard line so the Steelers pretty much in desperate need of making this Drive hayloft down by 18 have a first and goal here the first ility of having a Heath Miller I know he's much older now but able to get down the field and at least get a hand there on Jamie Collins as a guy that doesn't practice but about every other day but Heath Miller has bit of an institution there in Fitz and then it sets up on the right side and then his Spade left side tries to practice way and stop a little short of the goal line second down and going up coming things that DeAngelo Williams talked about he said I'm so much better a runner now than I used to be because I used to run with my feet not my brain now I know how to press the hold be patient take care of and he said that that's the thing that impressed me most about lay beyond bell it took me 10 years to figure that out and this guy comes in the league day one and seemed to have it figured out second down goal every will Johnson in both backs in right the fullback mouse running the running back spot Roosevelt Knicks a rookie 11 will take a timeout eletric took a look at Pittsburgh lined up and says give me that T oh it's interesting and I think you summed it up perfectly Chris the fact that Pittsburgh is moving the bolt they just can't cash in you get the two mystically field goals opportunity at the end of the half bogged down they need a touchdown here though yeah and Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski we saw it all last year as well I mean teams just can't match up you want to try and play some oneonone because if you don't if you play off against Tom Brady he just goes dingdingding Krait down the field I'd speak in a Super Bowl I think the first 20 passes were underneath until he finally threw one deep so you got to get in their face but you get in their face hard to cover those two guys the julian edelman their daily news weighin is Johnson but she does not cross the plane so it's third and goal Roethlisberger trying to go quick trying to tell the bench don't send anybody in here New England trying to make a defensive change they can't then on a third down and this time Junction is a will Johnson the fullback running out of the tailback spot behind Nixon they go in George and seven plays to get right back at it late shift down here actually work to the Pittsburgh Steelers favor they sort of went out of the hole and created just enough room there for Willa Johnson to get up and over the top another good block in there by Heath Miller that was muchneeded and now that the Pittsburgh Steelers one of the better teams that converting twopoint conversions now they're going to maybe take a look at that elbow it was down but now I'm gonna let them fire her they're gonna go 42 to try to make it a 10point game under Tomlin as you can see a lot of success keep in mind too if somehow the defense winds up at the football and runs a little way back they get two points we will Roethlisberger eleven inside faith pass is taken in by Marcus Wheaton for the conversion and Ben because he goes to the sideline 21 to 11 the drive the touchdown set up by the pace to it I've been Roethlisberger needed a little bit of tension came to the side one looks okay right now was able to get his foot out of the ground Chris yeah luckily so and it's got him sort of rolled up on that ankle and I go oh boy they'll have an army of doctors over to look at him nobody did Ben Roethlisberger I guess they just say he'll be fine stuff as a gun Michael Vick is the backup quarterback sign him weeks ago they caught through the end zone so Brady goes back to work again is 643 left into third 21 to 11 later tonight Jimmy Fallon welcoming yes open up our she's a new student in football you suck downtown Boston Massachusetts on this Thursday night 64 degrees in Fox pain Tom Brady has completed his last 16 passes beyond moose 14yard it's over the right side people wondering who they gonna use it running back one is suspended they let gray go this guy takes over watch the move here on the outside I mean there are certain guys you just can't block right you just got to make somebody miss and he certainly did with Antoine plate vision right to the line that hadn't doubles it even the rare times when he can gain no yardage in fact loses some as William Gay makes the tackle Dion Lewis really kind of a remarkable story he was injured in 13 was out of football last year didn't play at all and all of a sudden you're the starting running back for the world champions he can't go figure I mean they've got stories like that all the time in New England it just nothing falls between the facts with you is that there's no group the University of Pittsburgh fair fair second and 16 after the loss of six oh poor man was the judgment thanks to turn a second and long into a third and short is Julian Edelman well and it's great having young offensive lineman up there it's even better when you have a young offensive line and Tom Brady he just does not hold the football he's not going to make them look bad we've seen Peyton Manning over the years the same sort of deal but these guys up front are doing a nice job David Andrews and Trey Jackson check Mason young guys are doing their job and third and four here comes the Blitz through the middle and Brady gets buried by will safety blitz found the hole on the inside and buries Brady fourth down finally got something going here coming off of right here you come up and then Tom Brady just doesn't see it there's a nice job of disguise by Will Allen he stayed deep enough that Brady wasn't suspicious and just never saw it coming Dick LeBeau would have been proud of that dangerous anytime he has his hands on the ball 24yard tries to go back to coverage defense special teams group related fees 27 yard line a 10point game was war 15 left in the third on the founding family the Rudi's there is Dan on the left who was the ambassador to Ireland put that post in 2012 art ruining the second watching their team having scrambled back in the game trying to cut it even further Williams goes to the outside Craig's tacklers and runs out of bounds after picking up a first down a huge night for Williams taking over Le'Veon Bell and a Steeler debut he's now gained 111 yards well they're trying to come up and create some problems but every time they try to squeeze down DeAngelo Williams he keeps beating them to the outside you just don't see Patriot defenses historically give up the edge the way that they have tonight DeAngelo Williams has been sensational 15 carries and a yard to that total because I want to well fancy team name a great night here he goes again picks up about five war up to the 44yard line three and a half to go in the third these guys are in position on the outside and I think he is surprising them I maybe they watch some of his Carolina tape when he was at 2:30 he's a different looking guy we asked him how he lost weight he sittings all diet he says no I'm a southern kid least the love fried foods just stop eating we fried everything down he really is a funny guy there it goes again that is Tyrell Niner first year with the pastries picked up as a free agent make sure he doesn't turn the corner and Terrell Brown is going to have a bigger and bigger role this year all those years with the 49ers and the Raiders and Matt patrician knows that this is going to be a growing experience Rodney Harrison talks about they start very simple in the secondary and build and build and put more things in then it'll be 12 brown with a good roll on this thing six his main name better cuts over the middle does bad raucous burger throws Pink's brown and brown picks the ball into New England territory to the 45 yard line Ben Roethlisberger must have looked at four different receivers here he's like laughs and then back right and then just sort of flipped it over the top that has been some battle tonight look at this offensive line and they're playing without their leader Marquis Pouncy up there you've got to have a lot of protection in order to hold the ball and look at that many people great job up front from the 45 weakness emotion man it is cold swings somehow getting both feet in working the sideline makes the grab gets both feet in big game 26 yards I thought that Devin McCourty was going to pick that thing off but been basically threw it out of bounds and somehow Marcus Wheaton catches it out of bounds and gets his feedback in we have seen some tremendous plays down the field tonight Angela Williams back in and threading his way through thirty twoyearold running back takes it for a gain of six let's just go back to the protection now two plays in a row for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Ben Roethlisberger he's just holding it nobody is even pressuring him 5.26 seconds in the NFL that is a lifetime we talked about Marcus Whedon he had to make some plays tonight without martavis playing in there so is Darius a word back the 13 Fausta looking back and Roethlisberger protected well again yard line first down to be first and goal Patrick Chung made the tackle you know you want to say the tide is really turning here but I don't know that it is a Pittsburgh has been moving the ball like this up on down the field all night long they just weren't converting and now they're starting to have some opportunities to convert anyway 382 total yards it's a lot two recorders from Pittsburgh 21 through 11 into the 3rd 10point game back after these messages statistical update for each team is we go to the fourth quarter on the possession 24:27 for the Steelers who led the lead in that category last year start the fourth now Marcus Cris Collinsworth Michele Tafoya Foxborough Massachusetts to the first and goal who are the Steelers from the eighth mr. formation is fine they have lined up with that set second down and goal one of the things you'll see a lot of is Dante Hightower comes shooting I think this is him right here shooting through the gap here he tries to play on the other side of the line of scrimmage and then it gives some of their guys along that defensive line that time Rob make a bitch a chance once the bat gets diverted to then make the play second ego Miller comes in motion to the slide the shuttle goes to it's about the distance from the four yard line the third and goal from next pot sort of a semi shovel pass and not so sure pin couldn't have just walked that one into the end zone nobody seemed to really think it was a real run fake he was looking back inside and whirled the fence that Brandon was right spreads enough mister this fella tried on third and goal and sliding left trying to get another and you got Patrick Chung with his back to the pass and flags all over the endzone three of them just a great play by a veteran their dude number 23 defense that pal occurred in the end zone the ball will be placed at the oneyard line first down then really had nothing there was nobody open here's Heath right here and he realizes this ball is underthrown watch him just wrap his arms back around Patrick Chung like I'm trying to get to the ball he's not looking back at the ball that is automatic you didn't even have to think about it it was going to be pass interference Walt died speeding through three flags on the play ball for the same infraction defected to them in the past out of the end zone so Johnson went through the middle didn't play fake by Roethlisberger and then he throws it out of the back of the end zone second down the goal well the play fake you just everybody in the house knew what that was going to be extended his arm and then just sort of relaxed after he did that it break up defensively by the Patriots and not fall for that that one's the easiest one second and goal to have Johnson last time he goes forward wishes command to spot an entry shot of the goal line 13 Rosabelle Nix is the new fullback now and their former fullback will Johnson is in there at tailback so a lot of beef Nix was a fourtime All MAC defensive lineman now playing on the offensive side kept getting cut so they moved into the fullback and he is a force there and formation the tailback movement on the left side and that's gonna cost him five I'll bet you've been offered the ship got him to jump but unless I'm gonna guess pin saying they screamed out something and simulated a snap count inside there and that's why they jumped now I don't know if they did or they didn't but back in the day that's the thing that the umpire would have been listening for in there will not win the argument it's going to move back to the fiveyard line is then put Williams back in the game they need a snack they give it to Williams barely barely got the play off and better serve had they not ball sheared though paying his first dividend coming out of Cleveland he's going to come out and right back in here and make this play did not fool him he is an outstanding run player and they think he's going to add a little edge for this pass rush as well they are pretty excited about Jamal sheered coming to the Patriots Scobie now a 24 yarder he's too long the ones get on the short one of the and he turns it into a one possession game with 1139 left in regulation hatred Plato Vanson come in assimilate with Super Bowl wins great job here and I think it's a pretty good sign for the Pittsburgh Steelers that they've come out early in this one defensively at least had a stop and offensively even without some of their biggest stars in this game here tonight they've still been able to move the football very effectively and looked like we were buried down by 18 but back to a onepossession game bouncing ball is collected over the 30 by Michael Williams and he brings it to the 22 at 11:34 level centipoid secretly thanks a night aerial coverage being brought to you by Geico Austin on this Thursday night the openers the NFL season seven point game Tom Brady who's completed 18 straight passes was 5y the year on first down from the 21 yard line Oh sh t and the big truck rolling down a highway takes a little way to the 28 yard line 52 yards just a completely blown coverage out here there's nobody in the middle of field the safety goes to the other way when it's unbelievable how much the Pittsburgh Steelers have given away tonight Brady put of julian edelman incomplete second down and ten how do you get that wide open well here's the very next play and there he is again so this has been a bit of an effort here tonight defensively and yet here they are still hanging around and still with a chance to win this football game they just have to come up with yet another play they got away with the safety blitz came up with a sack maybe they just have to start trying to come after Tom Brady then ended Brady string he completed 19 straight the NFL record is 22 in one day 22 straight so Theon Lewis takes the ball in out of the 22 yard line Tom Brady so clutch of course throughout his career you go back to last year and the Super Bowl and they were down by 10 and look at those numbers in the fourth quarter two touchdown passes and a third MVP award against the Seahawks and the more defense in the league third down and follow them from the 22 ninetyfour right pocket pass is caught cracking attack Oh taking it inside the 10 then losing the ball but there is one caste Lewis launched the ball that Gronkowski alertly is their Amendola signals touchdown away to the officials the brake the brakes luis breaking tackles trying to get into the end zone and Gronkowski is right there for the hat trick watch this throw by Tom Brady how precise out in front I mean within inches of where it had to be to beat Lawrence Timmons on the play and now Lewis is going to call fit up a chance for the Steelers and guess who that was a perfect throw and now we're starting to see what Dion Lewis can do he thought he was going to score got a little loose that was Mike Mitchell ripping that thing out of there and they just couldn't find it my goodness gracious Gronkowski just living on the field on the touchdown is under review they're gonna see if Gronkowski recovered the ball in the endzone all scoring plays are reviewed the Berkeley comeback if you have Gronk in your fantasy league sorry about that but they're gonna take this touchdown away and make it first and goal then doing the player did recover the ball but he was he recovered the ball short of the goal line and was down by contact with the sixinch yard line it will be first and goal New England so Gronkowski back to two touchdowns my three first and goal inches away now the ball was on the line but I was Will Allen sort of swatted it back tried to get it back to one of his guys and then down by contact from there so normally a place where Brady were trying to sneak it in himself the Sea phase two really big guys if he tries to do that McCullers and Steve McClendon will be guard and cannot get in it'll be second down and goal a little under 10 minutes to play in regulation these are two monsters inside and sure Tom Brady is thinking out I'll turn around give it to somebody else here we've seen really good movement the entire game by that front but that time those two big guys took advantage of the young guys in there nation is the fullback Bolden is the running man the left side we'll throw that on that out of the end zone by Gronkowski and easy getting in third and goal Will Allen with a fool me once kind of a play there he needed to make that onehorse Tom Brady's lobbed that one up a little too high if you pre about took Brandon Bolton's head off and then by the time his feet come down both out there's the rookie boy they draft a lot of outside linebackers in the first round around here Nanga Chandler is the fullback Holden is the running back Jaylyn ah spits inside Gronkowski this time Gronkowski chairs have to touch down had to put the linebacker Garvin on him and he just couldn't handle them so Brock eventually gets into the end zone you have no choice you got to put your goal line defense in there Terrence Garvin out there and now he's gonna say rut row here they come and everybody in the house knew where the pole was going once you put an inside linebacker out there a goal line linebacker you just throw it up at the very least you got to try and put some hands on that guy to disrupt him a bit we heard all week they were gonna try and get hands on Rob Gronkowski but that was a nowin situation for Garvin there for touchdowns for Tom Brady tonight what just asking for the extra point so New England was able to limit Pittsburgh to a field goal they answer with a touchdown and the lead now is 14 was not wanted to go in Foxborough from Richmond Saturday at 5:00 Eastern by Smithfield tomorrow 7:00 Eastern with the Xfinity series racing presented by far better on the extra point holding number 90 on the defense that penalty will be enforced on the kickoff course they had the option there they could have gone for two breaking it down to the oneyard line the whole thing there's it takes a math wizard to figure out all the options on extra points down a lot of new stuff going on you gotta hold stuff going on with Tom Brady what else is new he kill strikes and carried over he just kills the student whose meat does in their way his whole career so Braden to Gronkowski seven attempts tonight completed five three touchdowns plus one that almost got in but he made it pay off at the end of that last drive 94 yards you know last year when you think about the Patriots ago after such a slow start they were 2 &amp; 2 the sky was falling all of that and Gronkowski was hurt when he got healthy away they went tended to down the stretch and then the three wins and post Mankins prey doesn't settled them in the offensive line Williams continues his big night gain of seven yards for him well they have not missed Le'Veon Bell I mean let's just say that at DeAngelo Williams has been sensational I'd say if they miss somebody tonight his martavis Bryant all this man coverage all over the field and he got a guy six foot four who runs in the 43 five range can go up and get some balls that would have been nice to have that big guy on the outside but receivers overall for the Steelers that night have done a nice job in white rain falling and some heavy rain not much during it Collins was there covering it'll be third down and three that was not one of those fun ones if you're a receiver Ben Roethlisberger let him right into Jamie Collins their linebacker here he is going to drop back into coverage and if this ball had been complete it would have been a major headache for Antonio Brown third and three the Steelers away the pain do go for it and send the fieldgoal unit out a little too early to go for it this deep in their own territory fourth and three I thought they might actually run the football there and see what happened you know it okay you're running games going rate great you might pop one and then if you do or if you just get close then you make a decision but a lot of time left in it Jordan berry good preseason the JonBenet come and Brad wing at a flag at the snap very short at the 36 and another flag comes in at the end as well of course if it's against the Patriots via first down right it was fourth down and three you got a huddle back at about the 30 with Karl Jefferies the offensive foul as you say Chris a first down rate he warming up on the sideline and it's gonna wind up being against well you got two flags so you're gonna get offsetting here so regardless of the outcome maybe a few exam that where is Roger it might be I'm trying trying to decipher I think that is often that file is missing holding number 53 of the the family will be in for well there was the firstever where is Roger chant you know if he came to the gate that I where we gonna put him are you two right I think anyone who knows Tom Brady expected him to come out tonight and play extremely well and he has not disappointed 24 28 for touchdowns another super night for Brady who now figures to slow down the pace of it over the 14 point lead Natan had to go from the 26 we start with a 1 by Louis you know Brady and we've known a long time Chris is able to compartmentalize a lot of stuff and he had to over the last seven months but I mean the wounds are still there yeah and I asked him pointblank I said did you destroy your cell phone and if so why and you know he didn't mince any words he said my representative said no way are you turning over your cell phone they have no right to your cell phone whatsoever and he said I delete all my messages anyway they even if they had gotten it what difference would have made Casspi going down the sideline and it's no good because he is out of bounds so that is incomplete they'll bring that one back and it will be third down in 12 and just to finish the story so he said you know they had all those texts anyway with just rimsky and Jim McNally and the guys in question they had their phone so it wasn't like they didn't have it so he was all fired up then at the end of it he goes I cannot believe that you guys got me sucked back into those emotions but we saw just how raw it was from Tom Brady and then he sort of just took a deep breath and settled back in and came out and played like Tom Brady always those third down and 12 Brady interesting comments insurance postgame press conference Belichick will say we're on the Buffalo that's when I go next week third and 12 rain coming down a harder night I ran most of the game down at the line of scrimmage then make it fourth down so Pittsburgh needing a quick three and out and that's exactly what they got yeah good job by Lawrence Timmons on that one getting his hands on the football exactly what they needed almost no time taken off the clock and the decision to punt on the last one for the Steelers the right one Allen's punt Brown has to back up is a flag down Wow catches it on the run going backwards into a decent run back but the flag is down at the line of scrimmage it was fourth down and 12 they're gonna have a little motion that's an interesting call there do you want to add five to that or have them re punt that one I think you're gonna have them reap on it you have used to punt it's too good 68 for 62 yards fiveyard penalty replay fourth down yeah then you don't want to you don't want it to be a 57 your net punch Sunday Night Football and it comes away in three nights as we take our Traveling Circus down to the Lone Star State football night starts at 7:00 Eastern Time New York Giants and the Dallas Cowboys that's what 7 yeah early on the Giants kind of dominated when this stadium opened I think they want at least two in a row down there right I should know we did a loss including the opener he begin to run together a little bit it's not Alan's quite a much shorter one and we fear caught at the 35 yard line by Antonio Brown so we are halfway through the fourth quarter you know the one thing about the Patriots ooh I mean and you got to bring it up the fact you have all this stuff it's a neverending thing you have the two longform pieces that I mentioned before coming out this week sometimes too much winning breeds contempt and there's no question there are some teams in the National Football League that don't like the Patriots for a lot of reasons we had a conversation with 15 opinionated guys the other night and nobody had strong feelings about what really happened in this whole situation there's just unanswered questions everywhere Roethlisberger throwing and and he picks up a first down in Patriot territory spotted at the 46 yard line well now you're starting to see the Patriots back up and give a little room so there's plenty of room out here to the corner route this is a young secondary for New England growing up as well and I think Ben's taken advantage of down just a bit here tonight they desperately need this Drive and need it to happen fairly quickly good protection the double coverage intercepted inside the 10yard line Doron Armand coming over from the safety spot help over the top picks it off it helped that Doron Hartmann was moving in that direction here he is here he moves that way but he had a running start on that ball because they were doing that rotation he was moving that way gave him a great jump and was there to make the interception much better job that time as well by Bradley Fletcher he was all over Darius Hayward Bay not easy to throw those deep balls into the in the rain either so with exactly seven minutes now it's the first interception they'll be inefficient Lewis last year the Patriots take a look at that over the last nine games six in the regular year all three in post fourthquarter touchdowns allowed zip you got top in leverbacks playoff game with your now it just didn't happen well became a 10point deficit in the Super Bowl to 14point deficit against Kowski Ziggler's the first down but he's not going to get it and be third down and inches in the penalty you know but this game really shifted with that goal line stand by the Patriots when they the Steelers were down to the oneyard line and then they jammed it out from the one your first down well that one on Cortez Alan Tomlin will take his team back home they have their home opener a week from Sunday against San Francisco well I would say the issue for the Pittsburgh Steelers coming in was their young secondary I think it's the same issue going out I think you have to feel pretty good about what this offensive line did even without announcing what this partner has been sharp tonight good play from the receivers but they're not the first ones that couldn't stop Tom Brady offensively a couple of mystery girls and says with the offense itself but but not very good in the redzone one of the big questions with Brian stork out there starting center put this guy David Andrews holed up and I think he's played an excellent game he was a college creation undrafted but he was the MVP at the University of Georgia and their team captain so here's a guy that got to play all the preseason and got a lot of experience they played together and for a guy that went undrafted and started for the world champs I have to say that was pretty well done there's the sidelines elements things around man stays in and gets the first down during opening night for Edelman has now caught 11 passes for 97 yards you know you go back to the playoffs a year ago and all he did in the playoffs was catch eight against the Ravens at nine against the Colts and nine in the Superbowl and maybe the biggest play that nobody talks about was that third down in 14 when they absolutely had to have something going and he made that catch and just got absolutely drilled by kam chancellor his arm was pretty good too yeah yeah really had that throat Amendola was huge in the Baltimore game II while Will Allen comes off the field stop the clock momentarily we expected a lot of rain that I didn't get it but now it's coming down pretty good how happy you think Tom Brady is right now on a scale of 9.4 that's a really smart aleck remarks I'm what I notice when I'm talking to myself brands who Boldin up to the 30yard line Patriots can begin to think about chewing up the clock it'll be second down Matt Patricia boy is he a good guy smart guy a science guy and fell in love with football and his I said it was a loneliest feeling he'd ever had in his life and they were down on that one yard line and Belichick wouldn't talk to him and they're screaming to coach you want us to take a timeout and he doesn't say there's no just played I'm not giving them a break bringing up working out perfectly you knew that going on defense in if they're gonna beat him probably that best chance creating eats up all of the plane climbs or amusing Lewis gotta love that Patricia look to you know the full beard hat backwards I want to make sure the defense sees them all in red and of course the number two pencil ala Bella trick well some things you have to bear when you come here to cut yourself go with rookie free agent David Andrews in there again and that is a big man he is going against able to get some movement and keep this running game going any more first down and have issues on 3rd for Grady approaching 300 yards when it's lower and that is a complete lob pass incomplete intended for Lewis and women will punt it away boy Steelers got away with one there they didn't have anybody at all in coverage and now Ben's going to get one more shot Brian Allen with his fourth punt of the night and Antonio Brown they could change and that one the flag down at the line of scrimmage it was fourth down at four the penalty was against Pittsburgh will be a first down but it's gonna be against the England they're gonna go over and explain the options here to Tomlin again you had a touchback and I think he's saying it was a hold on them so you can March them back and make them kick it again but you're taking time off lot I'm not sure what it made him kick again just so that brown GU get a chance to run it back yeah whatever get it out to the thirty so not all bad yep so a tick under three minutes to play Pittsburgh with two timeouts make it three so Roethlisberger has the time and we'll see what he can do see if he can move him around with those pump pegs we're asking him about those pump fakes the other day and he said you know 60 to 70 percent of them are balls I'm actually intending to throw but I just hold on to you know I changed my mind at the last minute it's not some intentional make to move guys I I'm really thinking about throwing it harder to do it in this weather there goes Ben escaping extend was he just so bullying and nasty the years incomplete intended from Miller second down it was really fun to watch the Patriots practice what Ben does best extend those plays and they're screaming stay on your guy chase your guy and they would make him cover for six or seven or eight seconds down the field and back up because so many times when Ben gets in that scramble mode he wants the big play he doesn't want something little and so you'll see their defensive backs they weren't questioned at all despite how long it took to get that play off play clock at three secondly ten licking off with the mill away back this way to the left side that is various a word may respondent let's talk a little short of the first down keeps on a woman and it's gonna be third down and inches and daria's a word bei kind of collapsed on the tail end of that plate he should have had that first down and you a precious seconds come off the clock as well third initials a while seconds go up that's Miller Miller we'll take the ball go to 46 yard line if you want to take a timeout on this side of the twominute warning they got to go they got to go they got to get another playoff here you go to think about the timeout on this side of the twominute warning otherwise okay you got the twominute one an opportunity for you to get an extra play in the corner pretty much like the end of the first half not very good clock management too much to go in Foxborough 2014 New England oh we're not there for Sunday night Sunday night it's the Giants against the Cowboys season number 10 Volkswagen postgame report Michelle on the field with an interview Bob Tony Rodney and Heinz will break it all down take a look ahead to Sunday night in Arlington Texas and carry two kind of mr. tonight won't get it on Thursday night know that part of our deal for the 46 Roethlisberger traffic booth and it's incomplete three Patriots converging on Marcus Wheaton second down to ten Devin McCourty right there and Devin McCourty was one of those guys in high demand he was a lot of people interested in him Patrick Chung there's McCourty and Gordie converted over from a corner but one of the things you always worry about taking a corner to a safety position is really technical and we had someone on once and he had to make against Marshawn Lynch in that Super Bowl and he managed to get him on the ground it was impressive don't you and unable to do it say word BAE Bradley Fletcher corralling plot keeps running 140 lat I think having to switch sides of the field you know a lot of times then the hurryup offense you won't see those guys having to go back and forth they just get wherever and that's heating up a lot of clock trying to they're done and Ben will convert that's brown making McKenney cheese inside the pink tree at 40 for a first down any timeout taken by the Steelers so it's opening night be one of 256 another big night for braiding starts the year with 14 days bloodthirsty catching three of those matches great job in relief of thesis three straight games over two years worth every game with five or more countries pretty remarkable really there's a guy that in the last two years more catches than anybody in the National Football League slight guy one big smile very pleasant sixth round draft choice back in 2010 Central Michigan and that is caught but a flag is flown back behind the line of scrimmage and that will stop the clock with 1:10 you've got one player for the Patriots which of all shared with his helmet off don't know if somebody knocked it off or not hands to the face number 68 offense first which the left tackle Kelvin btrim take a look 68 right there on your screen definitely hit the helmet the kind as he was going down you know what I mean it looked like he sort of slipped on to play and then takes away this which would have given the Steelers a chance glancing blow still yelling first in 20 from the 49 yard line for milliwatt and Roethlisberger that's all I can do to hold on to the limit helmet comes to play that must just barely have his helmet that's the second play in a row and he gets credit for the sack doesn't need a helmets gonna come right around the end here that's a pretty good pass protector out there in Kelvin Beach him too and look at the way he uses his hands they have been working a lot with his technique here they think physically he has all the tools and they can just upgrade that technique a little bit he's gonna be scared and anxious finding anybody so he goes to Miller to his collection of catches over the years he's up near the top of the charts in the tree at the 38 yard line they needed 27 got 18 so it's still third down and nine Brady most wins as a starting quarterback for one team 160 and farmed with 160 but tonight add 1 in 27 official seconds and then we'll put him atop that leaderboard and Heath Miller now the second alltime leading receiver passes John Stallworth tonight with eight catches ways to go to hit the Hines Ward though yeah bar man Hines and even thousand third nine dancing and setting up the fourth down intended therefore Wheatland so New England will start the year with a victory they will go to Buffalo next week and of course that means when Rex Ryan meeting Belichick there's Robert Kraft the owner this team bottom in the mid90s as watch them go to seven Super Bowls four wins three losses no denying what that guy has done for this organization well and for the league itself fourth down and nine from the 38 yard line Roethlisberger escaping looking firing and it's caught at the 22 yard line for a first down and we'll take a timeout one of the thing about Bob craft just to bring it up I asked him about his relationship with Roger Goodell I mean he's always been Goodell biggest booster among the owners you know it's a twosided thing he's got to wear two hats one is as the owner of this team he hates what's happened over the last several months hates it thinks it was unnecessary on the other hand craft is so important owner because he's on the television committee the relocation finance all of the recipe and Goodell have to do a lot of business together on that end and you talk about compartmentalizing things that's what Kraft has to do yeah and let's face it there's a lot of pressure from a lot of people around the league who think the Patriots don't always play by the rules so the minute something came up it was hey you got to go get these guys now this is not right this is a nut once again a spy game and all that stuff so it has been a strange political mix this year for the National Football League and then Roethlisberger throwing thought stops the clock weirdly enough for people who are just tangentially interested in the game they maybe aren't marched in what's happened off the field and on the field not made should not mean either not wait for it the end yeah we're we're not quite team Jen Sohyun yeah I only want to get into the yeah I only want to get into the legal side of it I stated in the one o'clock in the morning the other night reading that whole legal thing they didn't really get to the facts of the case it was all about due process and lack of notice and all that stuff Roethlisberger and that is caught by brown for a touchdown and make a couple of people happy in a minute here because Malcolm Butler gets beaten and Hickson an eightpoint game for the moment a couple of things that are gonna be in play here right now Malcolm Butler just dead perfect position maybe used up all its luck in the Super Bowl but we couldn't depend on better spots looking at the ball and somehow it missed his hands will speak about tangentially interested there are a few people more than tangentially interested right now scogan and that created a few boos and ahhs around the country believe me I don't need you to get me in trouble I can hear that on my own me too so that makes it a seven point game with two seconds remaining in the fourth quarter Brown Butler going head to head tonight you know Antonio Brown certainly made his plays but when you lose throw Revis and urine end up with one of your guys who wasn't even a starter in the Super Bowl that you're gonna say okay go cover the best guy or one of the best wide receivers in the game I don't know that Bill Belichick would go that's one side it at all I'll take that effort tonight from Malcolm Butler and that one of course the touchdown ends up really in garbage time at the end of the game that garbage time for some some way to keep an audience I know that two seconds remaining to miss field goes for big red zone fall pause were big is it folks Paul or faux pas you going home you know and really that you take the two most field goals in the blown chance from the oneyard line that's the difference in the game right now one drive after they cut it to ten it bogged down get a little onside kick here Palestine will be there and that will do it so the season has opened with a victory by the super bowl champions never trail Tom Brady for touchdowns another big night 25 out of 32 for 288 was Grady tonight julian edelman corn 11 Gronkowski caught three touchdown passes Michelle on the fieldfox only Rodney and hiya strip it all down both with postgame report stay tuned next",

  "transcript": "I never thought the trophy could feel as special but this one absolutely does I'm only a bitch in the what was it now everybody go one iota we go 2050 now Michaels Cris Collinsworth Michele Tafoya season's greetings and not a moment too soon after an off season that was one endless episode of Law &amp; Order we have some actual football tonight the Patriots truck become the first team in 11 seasons to repeat his Super Bowl champions the Steelers a regal franchise already with six Lombardi's and a prime contender to make it seventh partner happy New Year to the patriot motto this season and tonight certainly moving us against the world and it's just the way they like it around here is that you know Tom Brady really wasn't at his best this preseason was he distracted now probably is he motivated tonight oh yeah one thing we know is when the lights are the brightest is generally when Tom Brady's at as best I expect a big performance Steelers Ben Roethlisberger comes off his best season 11 and 5 got to the playoffs what do you think of that team the questions about the Steelers all on the defensive side gone or legends like Dick LeBeau and Troy Polamalu this is a young fast athletic defense but they are going to be severely tested in this environment tonight opening night game number one from Foxborough Massachusetts lights camera action when we come back the Patriots and the steel celebrating ten years of Sunday Night Football NBC Sports welcomes you to the following presentation of the National Football League national anthem please welcome Grammy Award nominee and New England's own grace putter you see by the dawn's what's so proudly we at the twilight's last gleaming whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight or the ramparts we watched were so gallantly me streaming rockets the bombs bursting in gave proof through the night that our flag was still there oh say does that starspangled Oh so the pregame pageantry is over and we go to the field now and welcome Michele Tafoya Michele both of these teams are without their star running back tonight Pittsburgh's Le'Veon Bell and New England's LeGarrette what are both serving suspensions for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy in an incident a year ago miss Berg is also without widereceiver martavis bryant who's serving a fourgame suspension for his own violation of the substance abuse policy meanwhile last night New England what they're starting proposed center rod Brian Stewart on injured reserve designated for return for a concussion he suffered a month ago he'll miss at least eight games and also starting right now Brian wound L is inactive tonight so that means three rookies will play on the awesome offensive line tonight David Andrews and Trey Jackson his start and Shaq Mason to see significant time rotating in Bill Belichick told us the offensive line talent is better than last year's whether or not they're ready is the question out all right Thank You Michelle all they have to do is protect the franchise meanwhile there's the part of the Pittsburgh franchise you've got bail and you've got Brown and also Ben Roethlisberger all coming off spectacular seasons Ben's best be part of that draft class back in O four with Eli Manning and Phillip Rivers so Brady's won four Super Bowls and Ben's one two and played in another New England has won the toss and as always they elect to defer that's Bellatrix mo3 Archer is back to receive the kick on opening night in Foxborough light rain right now temperature in the 60s Stephen Dostoevsky now in his tenth season as the Patriots kicker season on with the touchpad Ben Roethlisberger Miami Redhawks the Angela Williams the University of Memphis Antonio Brown century mission Marcus Wheaton Chandler high school Keith Miller Virginia Matt's faith Minnesota Calvin Beecham Southern Methodist University Ramon foster Ripley high school Cody Wallace Texas A&amp;M David de Castro Stanford Marcus Gilbert or Tony Wallace one of the guys in the crosshairs tonight marquis Pouncy who was out for about half the season at least pittsburg front of the 20 on the first scrimmage ploy 2015 and they start with Williams the longtime Carolina Panther and a great debut as a stealer and team yard game to the 38 taking the place of Le'Veon Bell Dante Hightower makes the tackle first down barely very rarely do you see Rob Ning kovitch on the outside not able to keep contained but that time a little bit of the speed and quickness of DeAngelo Williams the difference will give you a little grab a little tug from Matt Spain to help out that ever no flag 18 yard picked up on his first carry as a Pittsburgh speeder that same telling you a brown and motion to the right side and they flip it to him and brown great after the catch picking up yardage you need us so there a gain of nine it'll be second down and 1 Roethlisberger last year tied with Drew Brees for most passing yards in the league and when you do the math on that that's over 300 yards a game great TD to interception ratio 32 to 9 second one up at the 48 Williams and Williams takes it to the 50 Rob Minkoff H Purdue Alan branch University of Michigan Ducklin brow tech challenge owns Syracuse University dama Collins 7 me Jerrod Mayo Tennessee dr. yachts how the university felt from Malcom Butler West Alabama universe Patrick Chung the Ducks Devin McCourty Toro Brown takes and so Butler the Super Bowl hero now in the role of shutdown corner he should be on Brown most of the night if not all been fake Roethlisberger slipped that maintained his balance and it's caught by Heath Miller who takes it to the 35 male makes the tackle Miller now in his 11th season out of Virginia that's a gain of 14 the Pittsburgh Steelers have been running the ball so well now we're seeing this Patriots defense forced to react up to it in the playaction very effective DeAngelo Williams early on showing some will quickness he's lost about 15 pounds from when he got cut with the Carolina Panthers and it shows so calling this one Tom hailey now in his fourth year as the offensive coordinator in law last season seal is establishing a lot of offensive team records and DeAngelo Williams to the 24 he can flame all three now he's 32 years old we asked Tomlin last night can this guy really play all three downs he said at least for two weeks at the young Malcolm Brown right here and so far he has been struggling inside that time was David de Castro just sort of threw him away to the outside these are gaping holes that you typically do not see against the Patriots defense Williams three carries smack receivers to the right now he's lefthanded looking but the defense does its job and he gets taken down at the 31 yard line by Malcolm Brown number one draft choice out of Texas it helped that they were in a zone defense that time so the safeties back here deep able to kind of see this one from afar no doubt about that Antonio Brown who was a lefthanded quarterback in high school say idolizes bike Vick and white omelets that every time he looks at bacon kind of dosing wide eyed but Patriots defense not wide blossom 8 second down and Williams he gets bounced back but bounces off he would be tackling its thrust that obeys me of a first flag of the season Dante Hightower in on the tackle Karl Jeffries is the referee we'll hear from him number 77 offense Marcus Gilbert well he got away they held him the first time but Ning kovitch this time was going to get grabbed and very tail into this thing just as the Angela Williams was jumping to the outside you saw a Gilbert just grab the Jersey and dicot so what looked like a very promising Drive you try the gimmick play that goes nowhere but that works and now the thing fight your way back in the field goal and another second in 28th the backup running back is will Johnson fullback by trade that's Johnson behind blockers gonna give it to him Shelvin used as a wall carrier but freshman to backup duty tonight with bailout Williams getting the start tackle made there after a gain of about six and it will be third and very long and easily is down that's Dominique easily the injured New England Patriot the Patriots during the offseason pretty busy the Boston Pops going to Bruins games tiring that trophy around everywhere they went concert and nearest places lead who ended last season on injured reserve and we'll take a look at what happened to him as he was fighting there with Cody of Wallace you saw him grab his left hip and here's a young man has been through a lot of injuries injuries to both knees in college and finally healthy they were excited about he gives them a bit of an athletic pass rusher inside some of the other guys more run Stoppers and so that will hurt easily a player resumes with a third down and 22 from the New England 36 yard line Bill Belichick in his 16th season as the head coach here spent five years in the lanes 41 years total as a head coach or assistant coach in the NFL checkers going over something with Mike Tomlin still the secondyoungest coaching league Mike McCoy of San Diego's at least get in feel something do get a little closer Williamson's in the block and he finds me here and never does get open enough to pick up enough yardage to put them in field goal range to the 26 yard line Chung and Butler are there the Steelers now with a new kicker they were able to pick up Josh Scobee in a late trade a couple of weeks ago from Jacksonville because Sean squeezin their top kicker got hurt in the Hall of Fame game in Canton Ohio in August and then they brought Garrett Hartley in and he got hurt so they picked up Scobie with a lot of experience and his first effort as he steal there will be a 44 yard attempt no wind to speak of and snow bees first kick is no good lied to the right to a promising drive gets bogged down on a trip play in the penalty and then the field goal attempt no good here comes ray speaking of Sunday night football three nights we will be in Texas for the Dallas Cowboys against the New York Giants on Sunday Night Football here we go Tom Brady taking his first snap of the season Hey in the empty backfield fix to the lake quickly brought by Edelman and Julian Edelman their number one receiver gets forced out of bounds by William gay flag on the play coming in late personal personal foul number 77 offense 15 yard panel the down counts second down that's Nate's soldier who got into it with Jarvis Jones right at the very tail end of the play it's Jones up underneath him then you take the swing and there it is sort of all's fair until you get to that point and as soon as somebody reacts obviously the fist under the chin unsettling for Nate's older he reacts and he gets it Tom Brady winning four Super Bowls MVP and three of them and he joins Terry Bradshaw and Joe Montana as the only fourtime winners overall he and Bella Trek have been to six every one of the newsmen catch the closures of course was last February in Glendale Arizona first and 25 from the figgety the fastest part on the outside and that is on newest it was first in twelve he's that actually the penalty was marched off from the end of the place to his first and twelfth Dion Lewis makes the catch and that will give them the first down up at the 44 giving a lot of space on the outside as Tom Brady goes right to the no hado a cautious start here for the Steelers defensively Brady protection that's it to the outside Louis again playing in his first game in two years came up with Philadelphia got Bert was with Cleveland got Perth there was with Indianapolis briefly and he may play a very big role tonight Dion Lewis Tom Brady said this guy is about to become a cult hero here in New England with his quickness people are kind of loved watching him play and there's a brief taste of that like I knew that David would hit him he was here when the Pittsburgh 43 yard line with he going up your stairs it just now come going and get a little closer to these receivers when he swings that one incomplete intended for Rob Gronkowski Tom Brady Michigan Dion Lewis Pitt Julian Edelman Kent State Danny Amendola Texas Tech Rob Gronkowski Arizona Scott Chandler Iowa Nate solder Colorado Josh spawn Kent State David Andrews Georgia Trey Jackson float estate Sebastien Ballmer University of Houston two rookies at center and right guard one receiver missing is Brandon LaFell he's hurt undefeated list and brainy going B then a little too deep intended for Danny Amendola down the right sideline he'd beaten gay down the sideline before the safety help could get over there and it will be third down in ten oldest play in the park against man courage Julian Edelman is going to come down here just a little pick rub whatever you want to call it doesn't get called and they just miss a big home run ball there really no excuse Tom Brady just missed them Patriots they can beat you by running as 50 times we're throwing it 50 times against Pittsburgh historically they've been very passive and they start that way tonight no Russian so far five passes then great play clock at one town has to escape but not very far I can only get to the 43 that's but improves their number one draft choice number 48 making the tackle so you'd be looking at a real long distance field goal obviously here and then pass up that opportunity over 16 Ryan Allen comes in to punt had a screen pass coming this way if I Dupree unblocked on the play and for some reason Tom Brady's didn't like the screen pass late getting the ball and just got unsettled Brian Allen Belichick has always loved left footed punters and Alan over the years Brown is back across with fair cats and collects it at the 7yard line that's where Pittsburgh will begin the second drive off halfway through the opening quarter on open a night no score bill belichick on his iPad Super Bowl starters after the old one season they lost they lost four after their o three when they lost two starters after their old for victory and then six starters are gone on offense Connolly in Vereen four on defense including the starting corners browner and Revis and the third corner would have been Arrington who's now with Baltimore so Bill Belichick not afraid to mix up the roster nice come guys go he shocks people there is Malcolm Butler he of the immaculate interception in the super ball and now their key guy Pittsburgh from the seven yard line Williams and loins up to the 12 yard line Angela Williams 9 really good seasons with Caroline had a tremendous college career at Memphis he rushed for over 6,000 yards and four seasons there and they knew that they were in trouble in terms of lady on bail and is going to get suspended originally for three games now just for two they bring a minute thirty twoyearsold second active running back oldest actor only Fred Jackson his older second down and four take him down by the shoelaces by Chandler Jones number 95 then we third down no question one of the best players on this football team for New England right here Chandler Jones had some injury problems last year just six sacks but by the time it got to the playoffs he took off he and Rob Ning kovitch I thought were brilliant throughout the playoffs is Matt Patricia the defensive coordinator good young talent Dante hi on these things third and five showing blitz here they come and then throw is planned from Butler so Butler may have taken care of regard to locket but Brown says not me baby not me that is as perfect to coverage as you can have and watch what Antonio Brown the leading receiver in the National Football League does catches it right off his hand that is unbelievable he had no chance at that ball he's almost like what Malcolm Butler did in the supermoon Wow from the 22 yard line under the sea why couldn't it have been us Cole from Jeffers coming illegal formation offense number 68 was not on the line of scrimmage fiveyard penalty replay first down Kelvin Beechum the left tackles the back and look at that catch by Brown again phenomenal this was one arm and grabbed he had the ball and one arm and Malcolm Butler's helmet and the other he was trying to get his left arm down the ball got stuck on his arm at me still Cottle back in the 17th 1st and 15 this burger throws Brown there and to the 20 yard line for the 129 passes last season let's go to Michelle Al patriots defensive tackle Dominique easily has gone to the locker room he's questionable with a hip the medical staff was looking at his left side I'll tell you when he walked back to the locker room he walked slowly and very gingerly so he has remains there now we'll keep you posted I thank you for shell second down and 12 if the Steeler coaches headsets are okay right now we were told couple of minutes ago that they were getting the Patriot radio broadcast in their headsets maybe 12 Roethlisberger tough to bring down at this time he's brought to the turf by Dante Hightower the toughest guys in the league his saggy got guys hanging all over him throughout his career but Hightower had him and his grasp took him to the turf these two inside linebackers find a way to get to the quarterback I thought it was one of the differences in the end of the season last year both he and Jamie Collins and if you're wondering there is no horse collar in the pocket so even though Hightower here is going to grab them around the back that is not a penalty sakurachan 18 and then biased on but he may be a little short of the first down Heath Miller needs 18 gets 17 as they'll spot the ball just short of the 31 yard line Devin McCourty covering on the play and they bring in the punting group where as a defense you want to play that line but that's cutting it awfully close nice job by Devin McCourty coming out of center field and making that solid tackle McCord he made a bunch of solid tackles in the Super Bowl when Marshawn Lynch broke out a few times Jordan Perry on the job from Brad wing and tranny can't win now with the Giants here's a Minghella who collected a can flag is thrown there and Bella brings it back out to the 34 the flag is there Matthew Slater involved in the play Pittsburgh indicating it's against New England will get the call from Jeffers during the return illegal block in the back number 18 of the return team 10 yard penalty first down the weeks later opening night no store in Foxborough max coming to NBC a mind erase the body of clues that lead Paul's most really mystery blindspot premiering Monday September 21st on NBC Town Boston about a 40minute drive away but not in rush hour from the 10yard line I used to be a Lewis mr. pepper we started talking about we were told that they were having trouble the Patriot or the Steeler coaches in their headsets they were getting the Patriot radio broadcast that you don't think do you opponents would not call that trouble they would call that whatever there is every team that I know of has some story about what happens to them in this stadium and of course deflategate was all part of that and that's not going to help the fact that they're getting those radio signals in their headset to be on Lois of course there were a spate of stories this week longform pieces by ESPN and Sports Illustrated talking about pervasive and persistent cheating but the Patriots have extensively done since 2001 the one thing that Belichick has told us team and hey forget it boys we don't listen to the outside noise but there's a lot of outside know there's a lot outside noise and it's going to be enhanced after this start here I mean the Grady tries to sneak as he does very often Patriots at a very stern response to those reports this week but it's been an ongoing saga in New England enough for a first down Brady able to pick up the inches needed with a minute 40 to go another this is what Brady does very often on third maybe fourth and short now Brady's knee did go down but it's like they felt like it crossed that line but I tell you it is unsettling for a visiting team to come in here and have something like that happen you want to say okay we're starting the game now we're on an equal playing field but I guarantee of Mike Tomlin is hot right now from the 20yard line to the outside flag is long I mean Lisa should be listening to our broadcast mean the patient's radio guys are good but he was pretty good on Lewis's holding side number 77 offense 10yard penalty repeat first out and sold her second penalty of the quarter you know it happened so many times to those tackles that especially when they're not anticipating that the back is necessarily going to bounce outside on them they're blocking blocking and then all of a sudden the back jumps and the defensive player makes a move in the tendency to just grab and then you're outside the phone work and here comes a flat it's Brandon Bolden sets up wide to the right running back by tree all the way and that's plot sitting down at the 19yard line is Aaron Thompson the six week 200 pounder from Marshall tackle deer by William gay well probably the best pass rusher for the Steelers this preseason right there James Harrison just say that how about that he is the guy and Mike Tomlin Sam you know he really doesn't like being the leader he likes being the villain but can't help himself all these guys just ball him around like he's the Pied Piper they all show up at the cold tub at 6:45 because he does second and 11 pumpkin pie there's the sideline bug wrestle down by Cortez now Linda will be third and short on the first play of the second quarter B's we've played one on opening night Pittsburgh nothing New England nothing special continues effort these messages Gillette Stadium Foxborough Massachusetts Al Michaels Cris Collinsworth Michele Tafoya the seasonopener no score start the second quarter New England with a third and two at its own 28 yard line what a tease Thanks it went in motion picked up the first down julian edelman up to the 37 yard line let's go to Michelle that communications issue down here on the Pittsburgh side it was with the coach to coach head sets the word is that they were getting some sort of Patriots radio broadcast bleed into those headsets while that was going on the Patriots coach coach headsets were shut off so that things were a level for the moment but right now I'm told that everyone's headsets are up and working well again for the time being that's according to the NFL y'all stay tuned Brandon Bolden gets taken down behind the line of scrimmage one of the most exciting young players in the league right here watch them shoot this gap in here Ryan shazier I don't know that I've seen a faster linebacker coming out of college just has the ability to make big plays wasn't healthy a season ago but they say he has made huge strides this year and guys like Ryan shazier and Jarvis Jones are going to have to take big steps if this defense is gonna play well linebackers up to the 40yard line beyond Lewis came Heyward vo I'll stay Steve McClendon tear order that fought well today aren't there moats James Madison Ryan says 'view Boston University Lawrence Timmons Florida State target zones to it William duty low Mike Mitchell Ohio University Will Allen the Ohio State head so on Blake elusive sixes the question in Pittsburgh the defensive in particular that secondary can they hold up third and six and that's Clark for another first time that's element again that Pittsburgh be in there under the tutelage of one Keith but lay the new defensive coordinator going against the new quarterback Antwon Blake they call him Zilla Kazee they say just mean he's a mean tough guy and he has his hands full inside we saw in the Super Bowl as well in the playoffs last year very difficult to handle Julian Edelman at the line of scrimmage but a lot of changes in this secondary including bringing Bill Allen the veteran to come in and try and help him with communication Louis thanks for the outside taken down there for a short game so Dick LeBeau they did not renew his deal he moved on to Tennessee working there with Ken Whisenhunt Keith Butler offensive coordinator was the linebackers coach for 12 years so he was actually there before Tomlin came in milk our hired him and he stayed on and now he's the DC one time linebacker during Seattle second grade ethos and finds Edelman again the 35yard line tackle there by Blake and Alan trying to take advantage of this young offensive line up front gonna come with the old Pittsburgh Steelers cross blitz here but that was a nice job by Dion Lewis coming across and picking it up not a big guy but they say you stout and he will block and then you don't get there with more covering Julian Edelman already four catches Gronkowski sooner or later Gronkowski was going to catch one and there's his first of the season of the 16 yard line very difficult to cover the seams against Gronkowski and there's a big hole and Tom Brady got that one off just in time touchdown they came up to the line that run the play right pouchy the back touches lay in the yards 13 plays to the first score of the season and they've got issues with communication on the back end Robert golden is in the game and he typically is the special teams captain plays very little but he's going to come out of the side here and see that Gronkowski is completely uncovered they were worried about communication on the back end for Pittsburgh and now it is come to fruition that was poorly done the last two or three plays with that hurry up offense gave them problems you the extra coin a snap from the 15 three yard field goal and no issue here on the first official new extra point in the National Football League of seven to nothing all right our plane is up downtown Boston on his head 63 degree night and by 95 and head back to cover tonight's aerial coverage being brought to you by Stadium it opened in 2002 it open 13 years ago yesterday against the Pittsburgh Steelers and it's a night when they celebrated their first Super Bowl title now seasons that kick into the night and then starts the night sixfour sixfour 63 yards takes over the 20 when we come back secondary coach Carnell lake a pretty good player in his time he's the defensive back coach in his team this unit had a little problem here Chris yeah right back here in the back end nobody sees Gronkowski and now all of a sudden Brady sees that nobody sees Gronkowski but this is a team they're keeping this he's saying come on come on come on let's go snap but I got Gronkowski wide open and that's a walkin at the perfect matchup Williams running back diangelo stop sharp good start for the Steeler offense tonight but then a penalty they try to trick play with brown throwing and since then the Patriots have pretty much stuffed them yeah but what has been working has been DeAngelo Williams and what always works is Rob Gronkowski and one of those guys you definitely want to invite to your party I'm safe up on stage singing and dancing and heard all kinds of thing the guy that loves life doesn't it it's around 2nd and 8th from the 22 those two hi for Keith Miller third down take a look at been Jewish career number one pick back in oh four there his numbers right there that's his first eight years first eight seasons and then with Todd Haley coming in as the offensive coordinator took a little while for them to get in rhythm but he's been pretty terrific especially last season they are missing some bigtime weapons tonight maybe the passing game as much as the running game who turned out to be fun for me before touchdowns not here and the center marquise bouncy meanwhile walk this burgers going to go feet feel and it will be so on a third down in a hayward Bay at one point figured to be a superstar with Oakland he was a seventh guy picked in the online draft really hasn't done much through his career not getting another chance here a 48yard game just three catches last year but he can fly a 43 guy in a course drafted by the Rangers in that situation and on the other side Pratt like Fletcher a guy who got beat like that more than a few times last year in Philadelphia from the 35 yard get outside to pick up five yards before he's pushed away less than ten minutes to go in the Hampton New England on top seven I think in Pittsburgh driving mr. Paul sheared on the outside number 93 a guy that they are extremely excited to have but that is not the first time tonight that we have seen the speed of DeAngelo Williams hit outside this defense and boy you go to a patriot practice and all you hear from Belichick has set the edge set the edge so far in this game they've been getting beat on the edge Williams seven carries for 46 yards number eight is a two yard at government setting up a third down and two at the 28 yard line ten seasons in the league for Williams nine years in the league for a Mike Tomlin and everybody talking about when he got hired he won the Super Bowl in the second year the owner in the league was saying finding the next Mike Tomlin 8 1 it was the problem a lot of young coaches got hired none of them turned out to be anything close well in almost a halfcentury you've had truck Gold Bill Cowher and Mike Tomlin that's it at the helm of the Steelers third and three down to zero Roethlisberger that's incomplete Antonio Brown looks for a flag doesn't get it covered by Butler and in comes the field goal unit hey this Malcolm Butler is making an impression he's been all over the leading receiver in the National Football League now obviously Ben was thinking back shoulder throw there didn't happen the Malcolm Butler that's a long way from being a sub in the Super Bowl and then all of a sudden now you're covering the number one guy who's the new girl Remus I guess 46yard attempt Scobie already missed important to speak of and that one is good we picked up from Jack's building a very auspicious killer beginning seven of the oil eight and a half to go and a half seven to nothing new england after a missed Scobie field goal his second he got the young guys on the front tonight drafted pair of rookies and Shaq Mason and Trey Jackson that's coming in the fourth run that puts him under fire on opening night who and well so far in the 36 yard line rady off the play fake fires over the night edelman big night for julian edelman already five catches for first down so far tonight Tom Brady's getting the protection from that interior three of this offensive line if you're going to beat Tom Brady typically you have to get him to move laterally the Steelers would have loved tonight to make Brady step to the side but that anterior three their young that they're getting the job done luis people know where he is stuffed by Jarvis Jones at the line of scrimmage it'll be second down in ten they need a whole bunch of that out of Jarvis Jones this year they have been very open and honest Keith Butler the defensive coordinator basically saying it's time you know you're a guy he led the nation in sacks and we just haven't seen that look at the shot he put on Nate solder there and came in took care of Dion Lewis as well if he starts playing like that and shazier pers the way that he can was young defense good fast Brady before pressure gets their swings it caught Danny over his shoulder making the ground stays inbounds first down you play man coverage you're going to get a pick set right there and then you're gonna get the swing route they ham and dole up the sideline they missed the first one they don't miss that one it is a difficult proposition one of the things that's happening in this game tonight is that William Gay is being asked to play inside because they wanted this club of veteran communication between Will Allen William Gay and Timmons but you just have to wonder now is everybody a bit unsettled with their position that was a gain of 18 that is the big question coming in from Pittsburgh Grady gets out of trouble and that'll be another first down in the 30 20 yard line is Brandon Bolden comes out of the backfield to make the catch brothers you know we were talking about at the beginning Chris the fact that the defense in Pittsburgh that's the big question you know they're gonna score very potent offense especially when you know Bell gets back and Bryant obviously but that secondary was the key yeah and what you do not want to see are the mental breakdowns mike tomlin chief Butler intentionally made this defense very simple for this game as it was going to be loud the road and so far we've seen those breakdowns balance on this drive is beyond Lewis picks up 8 yards well the other part of this defensively that you have to see out of the Pittsburgh Steelers is step on to it and Cameron Heyward they have to take care of the middle in there Louis tries to back you swing girl horse down spotted I think just a little bit short of the 10 yard line well if this young offensive line can play and play well think about what the future could be here they've had the two tackles Sebastian Vollmer and Nate's older play for a long time here and now you've got David Andrews and Brian stork coming off the concussion Trey Jackson drafted and Shaq Mason a very athletic guy on that left side along with Josh Klein we're thinking that's a young Bunch could be here for 10 years raucous cannon in the right tackle third a short one already sneaks again that's gonna set up a first down and goals we took down to five minutes left in the half tell you what Brady's going to take a little shot on this when coming in from his right side but he has away shazier timed it up perfectly they doubleteam can a champ but it wasn't until a week ago that you even knew for sure the time was going to play tonight at the 5yard line therefore gain of about for these gentlemen William gay there to make the sub alright here we go it's tough enough to play against these guys when you've got 11 out there you show up with 10 and we have seen all kinds of trouble I don't know what happened exactly Mike Mitchell was coming in and out of the game for a little while and so I'm not sure if he got hurt but the throat then seems a little out of sync now defensively second Lord Boldin is the running back that's down Gronkowski the second boy they made that look pretty z9 play 64 yards for us five passes and brought to the end zone twice today right there Wow and they put him in because of his veteran leadership and communication they gave him a run formation and then just went right by Will Allen don't know how you stopped that big guy I asked Bill Belichick do you think you'll see cover two which basically means the middle of the field open he said nobody plays cover two against us as they can't cover Gronkowski at the 23yard line this task is good for all Patriots to make it work can you take a look at the solution for that's pretty good tip Jason day Ricky Fowler who won here last week Watson is in there Charlie Hoffman played well down the road coming up beginning Thursday off channel skinny right there to the 17 yard line the Pittsburgh Steelers haha trying to get out of it 357 to go in the open Rob Gronkowski came here in 2010 and since then in terms of proficiency well red zone since Brock got here 42 touchdowns three interceptions that's a 55th overall touchdown pass that Brady has thrown to Gronkowski until 94 in the zone both New England touchdowns now the Steelers from the 17 yard line around the tip by Butler spins away for another cup of the orange takes it up to the 22 yard line this is going to look familiar to a lot of people this was the old Super Bowl play come out with a pick now it's gonna come and Butler's gonna drive on it he just played it a little deeper but he did get a big shot that time on Antoniou Brown a little more effective pick that time Marcus Wheaton second and five we're gonna have left in the half draw Williams up to the 31:8 flag however is sown at the 20yard line holding number 72 off that's the center taking bouncies place Cody Wallace interior guys just aren't used to being in space and that time it was Cody Wallace who got out he's gonna make a good block but he just again is Angela Williams got to the outside you just grab the outside of it and you saw Jamie Collins begging for the flag and John at that time not a big hole by any means by Cody Wallace on that one at her second and 15 from the 12 those his way to the 21 had a chance to talk to Malcolm Butler about that Super Bowl play and he said when I saw him plant that outside foot like that I knew he was going inside I drove hard on that thing and just made the play he said one of the things that was really key for me was seeing that foot move and then the reaction time you're going to see come back in but he said I was so angry that that tipped ball I was covering landed in the lap of the receiver I thought I was to go to the games I had nothing to lose at that point I just fired my shot ended up working out when he came out on the next play went back in for you know why pass caught by Antone and he is out of bounds at the new england 41 yard line so a big third down conversion Butler again covering on the play and we posted the twominute warning 37 yard gain Antonio Browns not too bad either that time you don't get a good solid jam on him and that's an issue running that go route from the slot position is so much easier let's see if they come back to it five grams for him twominute warning 14 nothing with these stealers on the move so the halftime coming up they and Tony and Rodney are all here weighing in in the first half we'll take a look ahead to Sunday Night Football Giants cowboys but f time two minutes Pittsburgh has all of its time like that double trouble and Jonathan Stewart at Carolina four years at the 40yard line brought this burger leading up to the line will huddle mid40s five in the Hat stare has been waving the ball all night they just have to start the burden points atchoo 22 OH wrestle him down about three yards short of the first down in bounds so it'll be third down time considering those three time asking we'll need to take one here at stirred that in three and Josh go beyond we shot within and Ben's gonna throw tended to market Terrell brown longtime 49er came over this year and it's fourth down well and because you know what Bella Jack's gonna do he's gonna try and take away your top threatened at San Antonio Brown so they knew Marcus Wheaton and they knew Darius Hayward Bay had to make some place tough play here but it could have been a real game changer they just have not been able to do it now they're gonna go for it you're on board yeah Scotty would have to pick a 53 yarder Waqas Berger has whistle before the snap timeout have been called coagulating a 30second timeout fourth down when we come back first player to miss two field goals for the Steelers since 1970 first player since seven Watson discovery stays on the sidelines here's raucous burger after the New England timeout the 35yard line each first down here Darius named invade and they'll take a timeout with Pittsburgh because had they not prayed he would have had enough time to march down the field again back after the timeout first down 31 yard line Steelers have two timeouts and if the Royals smooth to cut it the inside to the 25yard line Pittsburgh letting the clock one here now you're to the point where really getting into Nerdist I'm not using a timeout here that's a lot of time off the clock second and five no it's not it's the official comes over to see your on the choc means I'm not taking that time out leaves them alone 13 seconds how could they mess this up there it is his right foot is on the chalk even when they get a layup this is a layup there's nobody there well I understood not taking the time out earlier but here now they're down to 13 they're gonna leave a timeout maybe two on the board in the meantime they'll take one here Wow the clock stopped well the clock stopped Pittsburgh had to take a timeout just to figure out what they get gonna do here it's third down and five at the 25yard line they have one timeout and I want to settle for a Scobie field goal Ben Roethlisberger that last one really moved the safety see if he comes back and now you're going to get another New England timeout yeah and that enables us to tell you this info kit go special brought to you by Verizon watch live prime time games benefi mobile only on four eysan by chevrolet finding roads by Everest the most intense IMAX daily experience September the 18th and by nationwide one is on your side snow here of course over the winter they came back in it when they had 110 inches in fact thousands of fans Boylston Street to celebrate the Patriots fourth Super Bowl win 96 degrees here two days ago the snow finally melted third and five from the 26 under pressure cause and that's incomplete they looks for a flag and doesn't get it and his 4000 so from the moment they're gonna get Scobie coming out to attempt a field goal of about 44 yards there is a word BAE doesn't play a lot but anytime you're planning gets mantoman coverage you don't stop you've got to make sharp breaks you've got to try and separate and you're brown on the outside another good job by Malcolm Butler that's been a 44 yard at 10 times an ugly ng would seem to be a wreck promise to drive they have a new holder as well in addition Scobie the punter is the new holder and that kick is good so with three seconds remaining in the half it's now 14 to 3 well one person not in attendance tonight is the Commissioner Roger Goodell Oh opted not to come watching on television to sort of understand it I mean you know he can argue both sides of it I'll tell you one thing if judge Berman showed up they would parade him around the stadium in a sedan chair we've seen signs around town free coffee for life for judge Marvin I read one article that said the only chance the Steelers had was given up when judge Berman made that ruling I tell you they've hung in there pretty good against this Patriots team even despite all they're missing on the offensive side so Tom Brady not that he needed any extra incentive or juice or whatever didn't remember he can say all he's man he pretty much approaches every key the same way yeah when he came out on the field though about an hour before the game for his very first appearance in front of this crowd they went crazy as you might expect and he gave it some pretty good fist pumps like he had just thrown a couple of touchdown passes knew that in the first half and the Super Bowl champions on opening night he drives culminating with Gronkowski touchdowns lead 14 to 3 coming up next time after these messages from miracle Tom Brady nearly 15 of 17 in the first half two of those completions touchdowns to Gronkowski the Pats 14 3 at the half here's Dan Tony and Rodman alright Bob thank you Rodney you spent time with Rob Gronkowski last week and he knew he's gonna be the focal point of this Steeler defense he made it look too easy I was too easy Dan and all week distillers talked about Jim and I being physical at the line of scrimmage slowing him down and if they didn't do any of that coach and with all the changes in the secondary I know about miscommunication but this is just lack of execution you cannot let the best tighten on the planet go up the seen my Tomlin was worried about the young guys making mistakes here's a big one no one covers Rob Gronkowski easy touchdown so now all of a sudden they decide to put two guys on it and guess what they still can't cover and get our hands on and we're gonna rough him up he runs right up the save you cannot let this guy score is too tough sounds that's inexplicable when the two touchdown drives Brady 12 for 12 a hundred and 34 yards Fitchburg had opportunities here they did and there's so much pressure on their offense they can't make mistakes but they're looking for the big play and sometimes it's not there this is a double pass a trick play but you see the safeties deep and Tonio Browns just got to throw this away he can't take the loss and then Rodney this you can't have these kind of mistakes where receivership gets the ball but he just steps out of bounds but offensively they were moving the ball they're having success then all of a sudden they try a double pass coach they get a flag out the words don't get too cute don't outsmart yourself penalties two missed field goals they should be in this game well the Steelers have more total yards than the Patriots do but they're down 14 to 3 coming up look ahead to the Giants Cowboys Sunday Night Football opener featuring Odell Beckham jr. but first while everyone knows that sports are exciting let's take a look at some of the folks who take that excitement and go the distance at halftime the Patriots lead the Steelers 14 to 3 meanwhile looking ahead our first Sunday Night Football game features the Giants of the Cowboys and the last time these two teams met on a Sunday night last November the Giants Odell Beckham jr. made a play you might remember even if you still don't believe it was sunday night football against the Cowboys its first from 10 on the 43 yard line who does have a long playaction is a double move out and up I go to jump for the ball I see that you know I like it uses the one on that I had was just the right arm and it was the only way that I was gonna be able to get a hand on the ball so I just reached back and little did I know my life is gonna change forever after that play you are going to see that may be the greatest catch I've ever seen unbelievable as a word that's often overused in sports but that was pretty close to unbelievable Beckham and the Giants will be in Dallas on Sunday night",

TURNOVERS WILL DESTROY YOUR ABILITY TO WIN A GAME AT THE NFL LEVEL. JAMEIS WINSTON LEARNED THAT LESSON IN THOSE CONSECUTIVE GAMES. HE SAID MOVING FORWARD IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE WE PLAY AS TURNOVER FREE AS POSSIBLE. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THEY START FROM THE 36. RYAN KERRIGAN THE TACKLE. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THIS OFFENSIVE LINE UP FRONT, DONOVAN SMITH, LOGAN MANKINS IS BACK IN THE LINEUP TODAY. AND MIKE EVANS, COACH TOLD HIM TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON HIS CRAFT, THE DAY WILL COME WHEN YOU'RE READY. &gt;&gt; Kenny: MARTIN TO THE REDSKINS' 40 YARD LINE. SO ON HIS SECOND CARRY TODAY, MARTIN ABLE TO GAIN 23. &gt;&gt; Daryl: YOU KNOW THAT OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR DIRK CUTTER IS GOING TO CHECK THIS OUT. HE WANTS TO SEE HOW THIS IS BEING PLAYED ON THE EDGE. RYAN KERRIGAN GETS BROUGHT DOWN. IT'S THE SAME ISSUE. &gt;&gt; Kenny: REDSKINS WITH TIME. LOOKING FOR EVANS DOWNFIELD. HE'S GOT IT. TOUCHDOWN, MIKE EVANS! HIS FIRST OF THE SEASON. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THIS IS A FORMULA THAT TAMPA BAY HAS BEEN WORKING ON ALL SEASON. IT'S JUST DOWN THE FIELD, A LITTLE BIT OF A DOUBLE MOVE RIGHT THERE. HE GETS ON TOP OF WILL BLACKMON AND IT'S OVER. A BALL WELL THROWN BY JAMEIS WINSTON. RUN THE FOOTBALL, TAKE YOUR SHOTS OFF OF HARD PLAY ACTION. &gt;&gt; Kenny: 40YARD CONNECTION. EVANS' FIRST TOUCHDOWN OF THE YEAR AND THE FIRST FIRST QUARTER TOUCHDOWN SCORED BY THE BUCS. TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS WITH THE EARLY 70 LEAD OVER THE . &gt;&gt; Kenny: 70 LEAD FOR THE BUCKS BUCCANEERS. EVANS HAD A HUGE GAME LAST YEAR. &gt;&gt; Daryl: AT HIS COMING OUT PARTY LAST YEAR IN HIS ROOKIE SEASON. &gt;&gt; Kenny: ROSS WILL NOT TAKE IT OUT. SECOND POSSESSION FOR THE REDSKINS. THEY WENT THREE AND OUT ON THEIR FIRST OPPORTUNITY. KIRK COUSINS COMPLETED TWO SHORT PASSES ON THE OPENING DRIVE. REDSKINS COULD NOT PICK UP A FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; Daryl: IT'S ALL GOING TO COME OFF THE RUNNING GAME. THEY'VE GOT TO ESTABLISH A RUNNING GAME. THAT WAY THEY CAN START TO MOVE THE PUCK WITH SOME BOOT LEGS. IF THE RUNNING GAME IS NOT SUCCESSFUL THE WAY IT'S BEEN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TODAY. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SERIES RIGHT HERE. WHEN TAMPA BAY CAME OUT, THEY SENT A MESSAGE TO WASHINGTON SAYING THEY NEED TO HAVE SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE IN THIS SERIES. &gt;&gt; Kenny: FIRST DOWN, MORRIS. AGAIN, NOT MUCH. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THEY ARE CONTROLLING THAT EDGE. THEY'RE NOT ALLOWING ALFRED MORRIS TO GET HIS STRIDE. HE CAN'T COMMIT TO A RUNNING LANE. THERE'S NOT A LOT THERE RIGHT NOW IN THESE FIRST COUPLE OF RUNNING PLAYS. &gt;&gt; Kenny: MORRIS TO THE SIDELINES. REDSKINS EMPTY THE BACKFIELD ON SECOND DOWN. COUSINS FROM THE SHOTGUN. ON SECOND AND TEN. THERE'S A FLAG. PASS INTENDED FOR ANDRE ROBERTS. &gt;&gt; Referee: HOLDING, NUMBER 21 ON THE DEFENSE, FIVEYARD PENALTY, AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; Daryl: WORKING AGAINST ANDRE ROBERTS. THIS FLAG IS THROWN EARLY. THIS WAS LATER DOWN THE FIELD. IT WAS CALLED MUCH EARLIER IN THAT RELEASE. &gt;&gt; Kenny: SO AN AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. REDSKINS SEND IN MORRIS AND YOUNG. PASS IS CAUGHT BY DEREK CARRIER. &gt;&gt; Daryl: IT'S A GOOD PLAY CALL, TOO, BECAUSE YOU HAD THE BLITZ COMING THIS WAY AND YOU'RE BOOTING OUT THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION WITH KIRK COUSINS. IT'S A GOOD PLAY IN THAT DIRECTION. LET THE RECEIVERS, TIGHT ENDS, RUNNING BACKS, WHOEVER IT IS CATCH THE BALL EARLY AND RUN WITH IT, SEE IF THEY CAN GET SOME YARDS AFTER THE CATCH. &gt;&gt; Kenny: REDSKINS SEND IN 68, TOM COMPTON ON THE LEFT SIDE. MORRIS IS MET IMMEDIATELY BY WILLIAM GHOLSTON. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THAT'S A BIG FRONT BY THE NEW YORK JETS LAST WEEK. I WANTED TO SEE THEM DO A LITTLE BIT MORE MAN BLOCKING. ON THAT PLAY WE HAD THAT, MAN DOWN, MAN DOWN, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO SECURE THE INTERIOR. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THE REDSKINS, 34 YARDS ON THE GROUND AGAINST THE JETS. PASS IS INTENDED FOR MATT JONES. LAVONTE DAVID ON THE COVERAGE. &gt;&gt; Daryl: YOU'RE GOING TO PUSH, A LITTLE STEP INSIDE. YOU'VE GOT YOUR SEPARATION RIGHT THERE. IT'S A CATCHABLE BALL. JUST MISTIMED HIS JUMP A LITTLE BIT. PLAYS ARE THERE BE A MADE AND THE REDSKINS HAVEN'T BEEN MAKING THEM THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, KENNY. &gt;&gt; Kenny: RAINEY WAITING FOR IT. TAKES IT OUT TO 12. RAINEY OUT TO THE 24 YARD LINE. EVERETT MADE THE TACKLE ON SPECIAL TEAMS. &gt;&gt; Kenny: SECOND OFFENSIVE POSSESSION FOR THE BUCCANEERS. THEY LEAD 70. &gt;&gt; Daryl: SECOND KIRK COUSINS TO CONTINUE TO TESTIFIES TEST THE EDGES. IT WAS THERE LAST WEEK AGAINST THE JETS. MAYBE NOT AS EVIDENT BUT IT WAS STILL THERE AND WE'VE ALREADY SEEN IT ONCE THIS AFTERNOON. FROM THE 25 YARD LINE, ON THE TOSS IT'S MARTIN. MARTIN, THE 12YARD RUN, WHICH HELP SET UP THE BUCCANEERS TOUCHDOWN. &gt;&gt; Daryl: '13/'14 WERE TOUGH YEARS FOR HIM. HE'S HUNG IN AND IS OFF TO A GOOD START THIS YEAR. &gt;&gt; Kenny: WENT TO THE PRO BOWL HIS ROOKIE SEASON. ON SECOND AND THREE, ABLE TO SPIN OUT OF A TACKLE. LOOKS TO TURN THE CORNER AND HE HAS A FIRST DOWN. FOR THE FIRST TIME TODAY, WE WILL SEND IT TO LOS ANGELES. CHECK IN WITH CURT MENEFEE. &gt;&gt; Referee: FALSE START, NUMBER 64 OFFENSE. KNIFE KWRD PENALTY. &gt;&gt; Kenny: CAME IN AS A SIXTH OFFENSIVE LINEMAN. &gt;&gt; Daryl: HE'S JOCKING OFF THE FIELD. THIS IS GOING TO BE A FUN DAY FOR ME. WE HAVE A LOT OF BIG BOSNIAIES. AS YOU SAID, AN EXTRA OFFENSIVE LINE MONTH. WE HAD ANOTHER TIGHT END, A FULL BACK. VINCENT JACKSON, A GOOD WIDE BLOCKER IN IS GOING TO BE A VERY PHYSICAL GAME. CHARLES SIMMS. AND MURPHY IS NOT ABLE TO GET BACK UP AFTER GAINING 24 YARDS. &gt;&gt; Daryl: IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO TAMPA BAY. THEY ONLY HAVE FOUR WIDE RECEIVERS &gt;&gt; THERE'S LOUIS MURPHY. 64, AN EXTRA BLOCKER. AND THE CATCH IS MADE BY MIKE EVANS. HE'S FINALLY TACKLED AT THE 12 YARD LINE. SO EVANS, WHO THE TOUCHDOWN EARLIER, GAINS 25. &gt;&gt; Daryl: BIG BODY, IF YOU'RE GOING TO STOP TAMPA BAY'S ACTION, YOU HAVE TO STOP IT ON THAT SKINNY POST. A LOT OF TIME IT'S VINCENT JACKSON ON THAT ROUTE. THIS TIME MIKE EVANS. ON FIRST DOWN, IT'S MARTIN UP THE MIDDLE. CHRIS BAKER, THE FIRST REDSKIN TO WRAP HIM UP. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A PLAY TO BE MADE IN THE BACKFIELD ON DOUG MARTIN. HE SPUN OUT OF THAT TO GET THEM A FIRST DOWN. WHETHER IT'S OFFENSE OR DEFENSE, THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE REDSKINS TO GET MOMENTUM, TO GET THEIR OFFENSE GOING AND THEY'RE NOT MAKING THEM. &gt;&gt; Kenny: OVER 16 YARDS PER PLAY. THREE WIDE RECEIVERS SENT. SECOND DOWN AND 11. PLAY CLOCK IS AT 2. BUCS GETTING THE SNAP OFF IN TIME. WINSTON NOW 4 FOR 4 AS HE HITS MARTIN. MARTIN IS TACKLED INSIDE THE 5 YARD LINE. NOT ENOUGH FOR A FIRST DOWN, GAIN OF TEN. IT WILL BE FIRST DOWN AND ONE FOR TAMPA BAY. &gt;&gt; Daryl: WE'RE HAVING SOME MISTAKES RIGHT HERE BY THE REDSKINS. JUST A SIMPLE ROUTE. HE'S LEFT WIDE OPEN. &gt;&gt; Kenny: BUCCANEERS SEND IN TWO TIGHT ENDS. THIRD DOWN AND ONE. OFF THE FAKE TO MARTIN. WINSTON LOOKING END ZONE. AND THEN HE THROWS IT BACK ACROSS THE FIELD. HIS FIRST INCOMPLETE PASS AND THE BUCCANEERS STOPPED ON THIRD DOWN WILL SEND OUT THE THIRD GOAL UNIT. &gt;&gt; Daryl: WELL, WE TALKED ABOUT LEARNING YOUR LESSON ABOUT TURNOVERS. JAMEIS WINSTON SHOULD KNOW THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO. THIS IS WELL DEFENDED BY WASHINGTON THIS TIME. THEY'VE GOT HIM MOVED OUT OF THE POCKET. DOESN'T GO BACK TO THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD. DON'T GO OUT OF BOUNDS, LINE UP, TAKE YOUR NEXT SNAP. &gt;&gt; Kenny: SO CONNOR BARTH, BACK WITH TAMPA BAY. AND BARTH, TENDS THE BUCCANEERS' LEAD. IT IS 10 &gt;&gt; THE NFC EAST GIANTS AND COWBOYS AT 33. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THE REDSKINS STILL HANGING IN THERE. THAT'S WHY THIS IS A CODE RED SITUATION FOR JAY GRUDEN AND HIS TEAM. IT GETS THEM TO 34. NOBODY IS TRYING TO SEPARATE IN THAT DIVISION. GET YOUR BYE, GET YOURSELF HEALTHY AND GO OUT AND TAKE YOUR BEST SHOT AGAINST THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS. THIS NFC EAST IS WIDE OPEN STILL AND WE'RE ALMOST AT THE HALFWAY POINT. &gt;&gt; Kenny: REDSKINS WILL NOT PLAY ANOTHER DIVISIONAL OPPONENT UNTIL THE GIANTS BUSINESS, TWO GAMES AGAINST DALLAS, ONE AGAINST PHILADELPHIA. AND ROSS IS UPENDED. TERRIFIC TACKLE ON SPECIAL TEAMS &gt;&gt; REDSKINS FIRST TWO POSSESSIONS, THEY TRAIL 140. OFF THE FAKE TO MORRIS, COUSINS, SHORT THROW. CATCH IS MADE BY MORRIS AT THE 16 YARD LINE. GAIN OF JUST TWO. WE MENTIONED EARLIER REDSKINS STILL WITHOUT KEY PLAYERS ROBERT GRIFFIN III IN UNIFORM LAST WEEK, DESEAN JACKSON, LICHTENSTEIGER AND JACKSON. &gt;&gt; Daryl: AND THEY'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TEST THAT. WE'VE HAD SOME GOOD PLAYS BUT HE WANTS TO SEE HOW DEEP THAT CORNERBACK POSITION IS. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THEY GET ONE OF THEIR STARTING QUARTERS BACK TODAY. &gt;&gt; Daryl: LOVIE SMITH WAS NOT HAPPY WITH HIS PLAY. WAND THE DEFENSE TO CLOSE THAT GAME BETTER. SO SENT A MESSAGE TO HIS TEAM BY SITTING TIM JENNINGS DOWN THIS AFTERNOON. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THIRD DO AND SIX. EMPTY BACKFIELD. COUSINS LOOKING. PUMP FAKES. NOW HE THROWS AND IT IS NEARLY INTERCEPTED. THAT'S BANKS, JUST WE MENTIONED JONATHAN BANKS MISSED THE LAST COUPLE OF GAMES. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THIS IS GOOD PROTECTION BY THE REDSKINS UP FRONT. THEY GIVE KIRK COUSINS PLENTY OF TIME TO MAKE THE CONNECTION. YOU CAN'T THROW THE BALL UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD AND ASK A GUY TO MAKE A PLAY. JONATHAN BANKS LEAVES HIS GUYS COMES TO THE MIDDLE TO HELP OUT AND ALMOST HAS AN INTERCEPTION. &gt;&gt; Kenny: SO PUNTING FOR THE THIRD TIME. RAINEY LETS IT GO. SCOOPED UP BY RAINEY BUT HE'S TACKLED BACK AT THE ADJEIBARIMAH &gt;&gt; Kenny: WELL, THERE'S MIKE EVANS ON THE SIDELINES. LOOKED TO BE UNDER THE WEATHER OVER THE LAST FEW MOMENTS. HE IS NOT IN THE GAME ON FIRST DOWN. TAMPA BAY HAS ALREADY LOST LOUIS MURPHY, RULED OUT FOR THE REST OF THE GAME WITH A KNEE INJURY. FOR THE MOMENT DOWN TO JUST TWO WIDE RECEIVERS AND SOME EXTRA BLOCKERS. WINSTON HANDS IT OFF TO DOUG MARTIN AND HE IS OUT ACROSS THE 45 TO THE 46 YARD LINE, A GAIN OF 18 FOR MARTIN. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AN AREA OF CONCERN FOR THE BUCCANEERS COMING IN. THE FACT THAT THEY'VE GOT TWO YOUNG GUYS IN THEIR OFFENSIVE LINE HAS BECOME AN AREA STRENGTH. THERE YOU GO, DOWN, DOWN AROUND. THIS IS JUST WELL DESIGNED PLAYS, THEY'RE BEING EXECUTED FLAWLESSLY. DOUG MARTIN HAD SO MUCH ROOM TO RUN. &gt;&gt; Kenny: HE'S AVERAGING NINE YARDS PER CARRY. BUCCANEERS KEEP IT ON THE GROUND WITH MARTIN. ACROSS MIDFIELD INTO REDSKINS TERRITORY. WHAT'S GOING ON WITH MIKE EVANS, LAURA? &gt;&gt; Laura: KENNY, HE WAS NOT FEELING WELL. I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT MEN. WHEN A WOMAN THROWS UP WE SHALL GET A LOT OF SYMPATHY, ARE YOU OKAY? &gt;&gt; THAT CAME OVER TO HIM ASKING IF HE WAS OKAY WAS LAUGHING AT HIM. HE'S BACK IN, JUST NOT WITH A LOT OF SYMPATHY. &gt;&gt; THE JAGUARS LEADING EARLIER. AND LANDRY TAKES THIS FROM RYAN TANNEHILL, HOUSTON UP 140 IN THE FIRST QUARTER. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THANKS, KURT. WINSTON OFF THE PLAY FAKE. PLAYERS DOWNFIELD FOR EVANS. NO FLAGS. &gt;&gt; Daryl: INCIDENTAL CONTACT. &gt;&gt; Kenny: NOW BACK BEHIND THE PLAY AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, SOME EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITY. AND A FLAG HAS BEEN THROWN OUT AT MIDFIELD. &gt;&gt; Referee: HOLDING, 76 IN THE BACKFIELD. &gt;&gt; Daryl: LET'S FIRST GO BACK AND CHECK OUT WHAT HAPPENED IN PROTECTION. SO IT'S GOING TO BE DONOVAN SMITH HERE, THE LEFT TACKLE. GET YOUR FEET RIGHT AWAY ON THE QUICK SWING, GRABS AND PULLS HIM BACK. HERE'S THE NO CALL. THIS IS TWO GUYS, HEADS UP, TRIES TO GO UNDERNEATH, THEY CLICK HEELS AND BOTH GO DOWN. THAT'S INCIDENTAL. &gt;&gt; Kenny: BREELAND HAD HIS HEAD TURNED LOOKING DOWNFIELD FOR THE BALL. SO NO CALL. HE'S FINALLY BROUGHT DOWN AT THE REDSKINS' 39, A GAIN OF 11. &gt;&gt; Daryl: YOU GET HIM IN SPACE WITH A FOOTBALL IN HIS HAND, SHORT PASSING GAME. WATCH THE STOP/START CHANGE OF DIRECTION HERE. GOLDSON. &gt;&gt; Kenny: 80 YARDS IN ALL. SECOND DOWN AND NINE AS WE APPROACH ONE MINUTE REMAINING IN THE QUARTER. WINSTON IN TROUBLE. THROWS IT AWAY. &gt;&gt; Daryl: WASHINGTON REALLY LOADED IT UP ON THAT PLAY. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE FIVE BIG LINEMEN DOWN. YOUR LINEBACKERS ARE WALKED UP AS WELL. SO YOU'RE SHOWING SEVEN COMING AND THEY'RE BRINGING ALL SEVEN OF THEM. BIG PLAY FOR THE REDSKIN DEFENSE RIGHT HERE. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THIRD DOWN AND NINE. REMEMBER THE BUCS WERE FORCED BACK DUE TO THE HOLDING PENALTY AND THE 11YARD RUN BY MARTIN. PLAY CLOCK WINDING DOWN. WINSTON STANDS IN THE POCKET. THROWS AND THE CATCH IS MADE FOR A FIRST DOWN BY VINCENT JACKSON AT THE REDSKINS' 26, A 13YARD CONNECTION. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THESE ARE THE TOUGH ONES, TOO. YOUR DEFENSE PLAYS WELL. YOU GET THE ADVANTAGE OF THAT PENALTY. WATCH THE TIMING ON THIS. A STUTTER ACCELERATION AND THE BALL THROWN ON TIME BY JAMEIS WINSTON. &gt;&gt; Kenny: FIRST QUARTERS FOR THE BUCCANEERS HAVE BEEN SIMILAR TO THIRD QUARTERS FOR THE REDSKINS. BUT THAT NOT THE CASE HERE TODAY. SIMS TAKES THE HANDOFF FROM WINSTON. THE BUCCANEERS HAD NOT SCORED A FIRST QUARTER TOUCHDOWN. THEY HAD BEEN OUTSCORED 389 IN THE FIRST. BUT AS TIME WINDS DOWN, A 100 LEAD FOR LOVIE SMITH'S BUCS. THEY ARE APPROACHING 200 YARDS OF OFFENSE. NOW AT 196 OVER THE FIRST 15 MINUTES. &gt;&gt; Daryl: IT HAS BEEN IMPRESSIVE. EXPLOSIVE PLAYS DOWN THE FIELD. A COMMITMENT TO THE RUNNING GAME. DOUG MARTIN RUNNING HARD. THROWING A LOT OF STUFF AT THE REDSKINS IN THE FIRST QUARTER. &gt;&gt; Kenny: A TERRIFIC START FOR THE &gt;&gt; Kenny: MIKE EVANS WITH THE GAME'S ONLY TOUCHDOWN. HE'S MADE SOME BIG PLAYS, DESPITE NOT GOING AT 100%. &gt;&gt; Daryl: HE IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THE REDSKINS 19 YARD LINE. THIS IS CHARLES SIMS WHO TAKES IT UP THE MIDDLE. FLAGS THROWN. ONE OF THE OFFICIALS HITS THE TURF. COMES UP LIMPING. THAT'S A SIDE JUDGE, ALAN KEMP. &gt;&gt; Referee: AFTER THE PLAY IS OVER, PERSONAL FOUL, NUMBER 78 ON THE OFFENSE. 15YARD. IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THAT'S THE RIGHT TACKLE, GOSDER CHERILUS. &gt;&gt; Daryl: YOU HAVE GOT TO KEEP YOUR COOL. FOOTBALL IS A GAME OF EMOTION BUT YOU HAVE TO BE SMART. IT'S A GAME OF EMPHASIS. THAT VIDEO IS SHOWN IN TRAINING CAMP, REEMPHASIZED BY YOUR COACHES EVERY YEAR. THAT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ONES THIS YEAR. JUST FOR THIS REASON. THEY DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO ESCALATE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE'VE GOT A FREE FOR ALL ON THE FIELD. GOSDER CHERILUS KNOWS THAT. YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO UP 170. YOU JUST LOST YOUR COOL AND COST YOUR TEAM 15 YARDS. &gt;&gt; Kenny: RIGHT. EVERY PLAYER WATCHES THAT TAPE. WE WATCH THE TAPES PRIOR TO THE SEASON. SO THE BALL SPOTTED BACK AT THE 29 YARD LINE. RYAN KERRIGAN OUT ON THE FIELD FOR THE REDSKINS. OFF THE FAKE TO SIMMS. WINSTON LOOKING BACK ACROSS THE FIELD. STAYS ON HIS FEET. NOW THROWS AND THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE, INTENDED FOR SIMS. &gt;&gt; Daryl: WELL, WELL COVERED BY THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS DEFENSE ON THIS. THEY'RE GOING TO SEND CHARLES SIMS OUT THIS WAY. AS A DEFENSIVE PLAYER, YOU'RE GOING TO TURN AROUND. YOU CAN SEE WHERE HE WAS LOOKING BACK TO HIS LEFT. HE WANTED CHARLES SIMS DOWN THAT FAR SIDELINE. YOU'RE CLEARING EVERYBODY OUT, BRINGING EVERYBODY TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE FIELD AND YOU'RE GOING TO TRY AND SLIP CHARLES SIMS OUT. &gt;&gt; Kenny: EARLY SECOND QUARTER, BUCCANEERS LEADING 100. WELL, THIS TUESDAY THE WORLD SERIES GETS UNDER WAY AS DANIEL MURPHY AND THE NEW YORK METS TAKE ON THE KANSAS CITY ROYALS IN THE WORLD SERIES FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE OCTOBER. GAME ONE BEGINS AT 7:30 EASTERN ON FOX WITH SPECIAL EXTENDED PREGAME COVERAGE BEGINNING AT 7:00 EASTERN ON FS1. THERE GOES KEEN KEEN ROBINSON. FOSTER WITH HIS HAND INJURED. ROBINSON SECOND IN TACKLES THIS YOUR HEADS TO THE SIDELINE AS WELL. PRESTON SMITH HAS CHECKED IN FOR THE LINEBACKERS. &gt;&gt; Kenny: SAW THE LINE JUDGE PERHAPS LOOK TO ADJUST THE CLOCK. &gt;&gt; Referee: RESET THE PLAY CLOCK CORRECTION, THE GAME CLOCK TO 14:20. &gt;&gt; Kenny: SO THEY WILL ADD ON 4 SECONDS. FIRST QUARTER POINTS, BUCCANEERS SCORED 9 IN THEIR PREVIOUS FIVE FIRST QUARTERS COMBINED. MOST FIRST QUARTER YARDS FOR TAMPA BAY IN 24 YEARS. WINSTON DUMPS IT OFF. THIS SIMS. AND SIMS ABLE TO FIGHT HIS WAY DOWN TO THE 21 YARD LINE. THAT'S DASHON GOLDSON, THE EXBUCS LOSING HIS HELMET. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THEY ARE REALLY STRUGGLING GETTING DOUG MARTIN AND SIMS TO THE GROUND. &gt;&gt; Kenny: JERON JOHNSON. CHARLES SIMS PICKS UP A TAMPA BAY FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; Daryl: WE TALKED ABOUT THE REDSKINS TRYING TO WIN THE GAME THIS AFTERNOON, GET TO THE BALL, GET HEALTHY. THEY'RE LOSING PLAYERS VERY QUICKLY HERE IN THE FIRST HALF OF THIS GAME. &gt;&gt; Kenny: ALL RIGHT WITHOUT TWO STARTERS ON DEFENSE, DEANGELO HALL AND CHRIS CULLIVER. THERE'S GHOLSTON. FIVE STARTERS DOWN ON DEFENSE. IT IS SIMS. AND SIMS MAKES IT DOWN TO THE 11 FOR A GAIN OF FIVE. &gt;&gt; Daryl: AND NOW THEY'RE JUST ATTACKING EDGES. RYAN KERRIGAN OUT, YOUR INSIDE LINEBACKER TO THAT SIDE IS OUT. THEY RUN RIGHT INTO THAT AREA. GOOD BLOCKING BY THE BUCCANEER FRONT. &gt;&gt; Kenny: REDSKINS HAVE BEEN OUTGAINED 227 YARDS TO 21. THIS IS SIMS. BUCCANEERS HAVE AS MANY FIRST DOWNS AS THE REDSKINS HAVE RUN PLAYS. 1010. NO PETER ROBINSON BACK IN. SO THE REDSKINS GET ONE OF THEIR INJURED PLAYERS BACK. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THEY'RE STAYING AHEAD OF THE CHANGE. CUTTER IN A REALLY GOOD RHYTHM WITH HIS PLAY CALLING. EVEN WHEN THEY'VE HAD THE HOLDING PENALTY, THEY'VE BEEN ABE TO BOUNCE BACK. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THIRD AND A LONG WALK. THREE WIDE RECEIVER SET. &gt;&gt; Kenny: TO THE END ZONE. AND IT'S HIS FIRST NFL RECEPTION, IT'S A BUCCANEERS TOUCHDOWN, DYE'S FIRST NFL RECEPTION. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THIS IS A VERY I CIRCLED VINCENT JACKSON. A BIG HEIGHT ADVANTAGE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN AND, KENNY, THEY GO TO DONTEEA DYE FOR HIS FIRST CATCH AS A PROFESSIONAL. LOOK AT THE CONFIDENCE THEY HAVE. THAT SHOULD BE LOUIS MURPHY. DYE, YOU'VE GOT AN OPPORTUNITY, GO MAKE A PLAY AND HE DOES. &gt;&gt; Kenny: ELEVATED FROM THE PRACTICE SQUAD EARLIER THIS MONTH, PLAYING IN HIS SECOND GAME AND HE'S FROM DIVISION THREE. HIS FIRST NFL RECEPTION AND HE'S KEEPING THAT FOOTBALL. &gt;&gt; Daryl: NOBODY'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT ONE FROM HIM. SO THE BUCCANEERS, WHO LED 100 AFTER ONE EXTEND THEIR LEAD. HERE IS CONNOR BARTH FOR THE EXTRA POINT. 170 TAMPA BAY. DONTEEA DYE ALL SMILES, SECOND PASS IN THE SECOND . &gt;&gt; Kenny: WHAT A START FOR THE TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS, EARLY IN THE SECOND QUARTER. FOLLOWING A TOUCHDOWN RECEPTION BY NUMBER 17, DONTEEA DYE. &gt;&gt; Kenny: A LOOK AT THE POINT DIFFERENTIAL BY QUARTER HEADING INTO TODAY'S GAME. &gt;&gt; Daryl: IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE THIRD QUARTER RIGHT NOW. THEY'RE DOWN 17. FIVE OF THOSE SIX GAMES THEY WERE AHEAD AT HALFTIME AND HAD A SLUGGISH THIRD QUARTER. THEY'RE DOWN 17 RIGHT NOW. IT'S NOT GOING TO MATTER. THEY'VE GOT TO GET SOMETHING DONE ON THIS DRIVE. &gt;&gt; Kenny: WHEN WE ASKED JAY GRUDEN ABOUT THE THIRD QUARTER ISSUES, HE SAID EVERYBODY'S CALLING FOR ADJUSTMENTS BUT THEY'VE HAD THE LEAD AT HALFTIME IN FIVE OF SIX GAMES. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THEY'VE HAD TURNOVERS, THEY HAVEN'T PERFORMED WELL. THERE'S THINGS YOU CAN'T DO. THEY'RE NOT MAKING PLAYS. A LOT OF TIMES IT JUST COMES DOWN TO THE PLAYERS. &gt;&gt; Kenny: 11 TOTAL PLAYS FOR THE REDSKINS. 11 FIRST DOWNS FOR THE BUCS. INCREDIBLE. THIS IS JONES. AND MATT JONES PICKS UP A FIRST DOWN. WE'VE SEEN HIM STRUGGLE. THAT IS THE FIRST FIRST DOWN FOR THE REDSKINS OFFENSE. THEIR ONLY OTHER FIRST DOWN CAME VIA PENALTY. &gt;&gt; Daryl: ALFRED MORRIS &gt;&gt; Kenny: THE CATCH IS MADE ACROSS MIDFIELD. &gt;&gt; Daryl: PIERRE GARCON IS GOING TO CROSS THE FIELD AT THAT INTERMEDIATE LEVEL. HE'S OPEN RIGHT AWAY. HE BEATS MIKE JENKINS ON THE RELEASE TO THE INSIDE. SAFETY HELP. LATE GETTING THERE. &gt;&gt; Kenny: FIRST CATCH FOR GARCON. BIGGEST PLAY OF THE DAY FOR THE REDSKINS OFFENSIVELY AND THEIR FIRST TRIP ACROSS MIDFIELD. FROM THE TAMPA BAY 48. COUSINS OVER THE TOP AND THE CATCH IS MADE FOR A FIVEYARD PICK UP. IT'S THE TIGHT END JORDAN REED AFTER MISSING THE LAST TWO GAMES DUE IT A CONCUSSION. &gt;&gt; Daryl: YOU'RE ALREADY WITHOUT DESEAN JACKSON. REED HAS BEEN SO GOOD ON THIRD DOWN. &gt;&gt; Kenny: NOW SECOND AND SIX. HANDOFF TO JONES. HE'S WRAPPED UP IMMEDIATELY BY CLINT McDONALD. &gt;&gt; Daryl: HERE'S THAT DIFFERING STYLE. JONES I LIKE IN THE MAN SCHEME. HE CUTS BACK TOO EARLY. THERE ARE CERTAIN LANDMARKS WHERE YOU DON'T WANT TO COME BACK BEHIND. I THINK MATT JONES WAS A LITTLE BIT IMPATIENT ON THAT ZONE RUN AND CLINTON McDONALD PLAYED IS PERFECTLY. &gt;&gt; Kenny: REDSKINS MUST GET TO THE 38. IN TROUBLE. DOWN HE GOES. BALL COMES LOOSE! TAKING THE BALL AWAY IS HOWARD JONES FOR A BUCCANEERS TOUCHDOWN! &gt;&gt; Daryl: TIME IN THE POCKET IS GOING TO COME FROM KIRK COUSINS. NOBODY REALLY NOTICES EXCEPT HOWARD JONES. JACQUIES SMITH, PRETTY ATHLETIC. &gt;&gt; Kenny: HOWARD JONES MADE HIS DEBUT AGAINST JACKSONVILLE TWO WEEKS AGO. WAS SIGNED OFF THE PRACTICE SQUAD. &gt;&gt; Referee: 15YARD PENALTY, AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S ON WILLIAM GHOLSTON, CAUGHT KICKING AN OPPONENT. GHOLSTON HEADS OFF. &gt;&gt; Daryl: YOU JUST GOT TO STAY TUNED, I CAN'T FINISH RIGHT NOW. YOU GOT 7:30 TO GO HERE IN THE SECOND QUARTER. A LITTLE BIT MORE SENSE OF URGENCY FROM PLAY TO PLAY BUT DON'T JUMP INTO ANYTHING CRAZY RIGHT NOW, A TWOMINUTE SCENARIO. CONTINUE TO MOVE THE BALL, BUILD OFF THE POSITIVES YOU HAD ON THAT LAST SERIES. SEE IF YOU CAN GET SOME POINTS HERE ON THIS DRIVE. &gt;&gt; Kenny: SECOND DOWN AND THREE. COUSINS COMPLETE. INTO BUCCANEERS TERRITORY. IT'S JAMISON CROWDER WHO MAKES THE CATCH AT THE TAMPA BAY 37, AN 18YARD CONNECTION. &gt;&gt; Daryl: GETTING A GOOD LITTLE MIX RIGHT HERE. YOU HAD THE BOOT ON THE LAST PLAY. ABLE TO CHECK THAT DOWN THIS TIME. A LITTLE QUICK THROW UP THE SEAM. &gt;&gt; Kenny: JONES IN THE BACKFIELD, TAKES THE HANDOFF FROM COUSINS. MATT JONES, RUNNING HARD, STAYS ON HIS FEET. AND IS TACKLED AT THE 34 YARD LINE. GAIN A THREE AS WE HEAD TO LOS ANGELES. SAY HELLO TO MIKE HILL. &gt;&gt; GUYS, GOT ANOTHER NFC SOUTH TEAM, HOW ABOUT THE PASS FROM DREW BREES, 16YARD SCORE, 200 SAINTS! &gt;&gt; Kenny: YOU KNOW MIKE WAS PRACTICING THAT ONE. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THAT'S ONE OF THE ONES WE HAD TO SPEND MORE TIME ON. YOU DID A GOOD JOB TODAY WITH THE JUDE ADJEIBARIMAH. &gt;&gt; Kenny: CAUGHT THAT, HUH? &gt;&gt; Daryl: YEAH. &gt;&gt; Kenny: SECOND DOWN AND SEVEN. COUSINS QUICK RELEASE. AND FINDING HIS WAY FOR A FIRST DOWN IS GARCON. &gt;&gt; Daryl: VERY SIMILAR TO THE LAST POSSESSION, THEY HAD THAT RHYTHM GOING, THEY GOT IT BACK AGAIN. I LIKE THE PLAY CALL. KEEPING TAMPA BAY OFF BALANCE HERE, A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; Kenny: NEW SET OF DOWNS FOR THE REDSKINS. COUSINS 9 OF 11 OVERALL. OFF THE FAKE TO JONES. COMPLETE TO RYAN BRANT. BRANT INSIDE THE 10! DOWN TO THE TAMPA BAY 7. ANOTHER WASHINGTON REDSKINS FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THAT'S GOOD PATIENCE AND GOOD VISION BY KIRK COUSINS. HE WAS ABOUT TO SHIFT TO THAT CROSSING ROUTE, LET IT PLAY OUT A LITTLE LONGER. ABLE TO FIND RYAN GRANT. HE WAITS, PULL IT IS DOWN. DROPS IT ON TO THE LOWER LEVEL TO RYAN GRANT FOR A NICE CATCH AND RUN. &gt;&gt; Kenny: A GAIN OF 19. JONES IN THE BACKFIELD, FIRST AND GOAL FROM THE 8. AND COUSINS TAKES IT IN FOR A REDSKINS TOUCHDOWN! &gt;&gt; Daryl: I TELL YOU, I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW BIG A DRIVE THAT WAS, HOW BIG A SERIES THAT WAS FOR KIRK COUSINS, JAY GRUDEN, THE WHOLE OFFENSIVE SIDE OF THE BALL RIGHT THERE. VERY DIFFERENT PLAYS, CHALLENGED TAMPA BAY THE ENTIRE SERIES. LOOK AT THE LAST ONE. A LITTLE ZONE READ WITH KIRK COUSINS. WILLIAM GHOLSTON COLLAPSES DOWN. &gt;&gt; Kenny: GHOLSTON AND COUSINS, TEAMMATES AT MICHIGAN STATE. HERE IS DUSTIN HOPKINS FOR THE EXTRA POINT. IT IS NOW 247 TAMPA BAY. AS COUSINS TAKES IT IN FROM EIGHT YARDS OUT. &gt;&gt; Kenny: WELCOME BACK, KENNY ALBERT, DARYL JOHNSTON, LAURA OKMIN. KIRK COUSINS WITH THE REDSKINS' FIRST GOAL OF THE DAY. &gt;&gt; Daryl: YOU GO TO THE DRIVE PRIOR TO IT WHERE THEY'RE FINALLY MOVING A LITTLE BIT, EVERY OPPORTUNITY FOR THE REDSKINS TO BE EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED COMING OUT IN THAT ONE BUT THEY TAKE IT DOWN THE &gt;&gt;&gt; ROBERT GRIFFIN III LOOKING AT THE TABLET WITH KIRK COUSINS. &gt;&gt; Daryl: ADJUSTMENTS DON'T ALLOW FOR HALFTIME. YOU'RE DOING IT IN BETWEEN SERIES. KIRK COUSINS IS OVER THERE, HERE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS WE LIKED ON THAT DRIVE. &gt;&gt; Kenny: AND THE TOSS TO MARTIN. HE IS STOPPED FOR A LOSS OF TWO. JASON HATCHER FOR THE REDSKINS. WE CHECK IN WITH LAURA. &gt;&gt; Laura: YOU GUYS ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW BANGED UP WASHINGTON'S DEFENSE WAS COMING IN. IT CONTINUES. RYAN KERRIGAN IS OUT WITH A FRACTURED HAND. ROBINSON, TRAINERS WERE WORKING ON HIM THAT WHOLE LAST SERIES AND GHOLSTON, HIS HELMET GASHED HIS MOUTH AND WOULDN'T STOP BLEEDING FOR QUITE SOME TIME. &gt;&gt; Kenny: KERRIGAN IS OUT WITH A FRACTURED RIGHT HAND. &gt;&gt; Daryl: TAMPA BAY CAN'T GO TO SLEEP RIGHT NOW. ALL THE MOMENTUM HAS SHIFTED AFTER THAT FUMBLE RECOVERY FOR THE TOUCHDOWN, TAMPA BAY HAD IT ALL. IT'S 240. THAT OFFENSE FOR THE REDSKINS DOES A GREAT JOB GOING DOWN THE FIELD AND STEALING IT BACK. THE REDSKINS HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB. JAMEIS, YOU SEE WHAT'S HE'S DONE. CAN HE KEEP THAT GOING? THIRDANDLONG SITUATION. &gt;&gt; Kenny: BUCCANEERS MUST GET TO THE 30. THE SCREEN TO BOBBY RAINEY. SO TAMPA BAY FOR THE FIRST TIME TODAY WILL PUNT IT AWAY. &gt;&gt; Daryl: AGAIN, IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT, A SAFE, CONSERVATIVE PLAY CALL YOU'RE GOING TO GO WITH THE SCREEN PASS, BOBBY RAINEY CHECKED TO MAKE SURE PROTECTION'S THERE. MAYBE HE BREAKS A TACKLE, GETS A FIRST DOWN. THE REDSKINS KNOW THEY HAVE TO GET BODIES TO THE FOOTBALL. &gt;&gt; Kenny: JACOB SCHUM. HIS FIRST PUNT FORCES CROWDER BACK. AND JAMISON CROWDER TAKES IT OUT TO THE 32 YARD LINE, 49YARD PUNT AND THREE ON THE RETURN. SO FOR THE REDSKINS, AN OPPORTUNITY HERE, DARYL, WITH UNDER THREE MINUTES REMAINING IN THE HALF. AS YOU SAID, TAMPA BAY HAD ALL THE MOMENTUM LEADING 240. REDSKINS SCORE AND NOW THEY GET THE BALL RIGHT BACK. &gt;&gt; Daryl: HOW IMPRESSIVE WOULD IT BE FOR THEM TO BOUNCE BACK. MAYBE IT'S THE THIRD QUARTER THAT THE REDSKINS TAKE CONTROL AND REALLY GET BACK IN THIS GAME. THAT WOULD BE HUGE FOR THE CONFIDENCE BOOST. I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH HOW THEY HUNG TOGETHER THERE. GREAT RESPONSE BY KIRK COUSINS AND HIS GROUP. THE DEFENSE FOLLOWS UP AND GETS THEM THE BALL RIGHT BACK. &gt;&gt; Kenny: TAMPA BAY WILL GET THE BALL FIRST FOLLOWING HALFTIME. THEY DEFERRED AT THE START OF THE GAME. BEST STARTING FIELD POSITION OF THE DAY FOR THE REDSKINS. FROM THE 33 YARD LINE, OFF THE PLAY FAKE, PASS IS CAUGHT BY JONES OUT OF THE BACKFIELD. HE SPINS OUT ACROSS THE 45 YARD LINE FOR A REDSKINS FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; Daryl: YOU SEE THAT OUT IN THE OPEN SPACE, A LITTLE BIT MORE NIMBLE, A LITTLE BIT MORE MAKE YOU MISS ABILITY THAN ALFRED MORRIS. MORE OF A PUNISHING PLAYER OUT IN SPACE. GOING TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME BIG PLAYS. &gt;&gt; Kenny: IT'S JONES ON FIRST DOWN, A GAIN OF THREE. AS THE CLOCK WINDS DOWN AND WE WILL HIT THE TWOMINUTE WARNING WITH THE REDSKINS ON THE MOVE. THEY SCORED A TOUCHDOWN ON THEIR LAST POSSESSION. IT'S JAMEIS &gt;&gt; Kenny: GET APPS, VIDEOS AND MORE AT iTUNES.COM/NFL. TWO MINUTES TO PLAY SECOND QUARTER. REDSKINS HAVE PICKED UP THE LAST EIGHT FIRST DOWNS OF THE GAME. BUCS WENT THREE AND OUT ON THEIR LAST DRIVE. ALSO SCORED A DEFENSIVE TOUCHDOWN. COUSINS IS ABLE TO GET RID OF IT. AND IT IS JORDAN REED WHO MAKES THE CATCH AT THE BUCS 47. &gt;&gt; Daryl: HE STANDS TALL IN THAT POCKET. EVERYTHING STARTING TO BREAK DOWN ON THE OUTSIDE. YOU CAN SEE HE SHOWS RIGHT THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; Kenny: AND NOW THE BUCS WILL USE A TIMEOUT. BUCCANEERS TOOK THE TIMEOUT AND STOPPED THE CLOCK PRIOR TO THIRD DOWN. A LOOK AT WHAT'S COMING UP ON THE VISA HALFTIME REPORT. KURT. &gt;&gt; COMING UP ON THE VITA HALFTIME, BLAKE BORTLES OVERCOMES A LATE PICK IN LONDON. THE PATRIOTS TRY TO STAY PICTURE PERFECT AGAINST THE JETS AND THE DOLPHINS HAVE SOMETHING DEVELOPING AGAINST THE TEXANS. HIGHLIGHTS AND MORE AT THE HALF. &gt;&gt; Daryl: KURT MENTIONED THE DOLPHINS LEADING HOUSTON 350. THE THREE FLORIDA TEAMS HAVE OUTSCORED THEIR OPPONENTS IN THE FIRST HALF TODAY IF THEIR THREE GAMES 8617. AND IT'S INCOMPLETE. THE BIG HIT WAS LAID ON ANDRE ROBERTS BY CHRIS CONTE. &gt;&gt; Daryl: GOT TO COME OUT OF YOUR SLOT, WORKED THE VERTICAL ROUTE RIGHT THERE. THERE'S THE HIT BY CHRIS CONTE. HAS A REAL NOSE FOR THE BALL. THE BIG THING IS CAN HE STAY HEALTHY. HE ALSO DOES IT WITHIN THE DOWN BOUNDARIES OF THE RULES. &gt;&gt; Kenny: AND NOW JAY GRUDEN LEAVES HIS OFFENSE ON THE FIELD ON FOURTH DOWN. THEY DID NOT CONVERT. A LOT OF TIME LEFT FOR THE BUCCANEERS. FOURTH AND TWO. THE REDSKINS PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN. IT'S CROWDER BUT THERE IS A FLAG. &gt;&gt; Daryl: JAMISON CROWDER HAS REALLY STEPPED UP SINCE THAT ATLANTA GAME. BECOME ANOTHER WEAPON IN THE PASSING GAME. TOUGH TO COVER ON THOSE UNDERNEATH ROUTES. YOU WONDER IF THIS COULD BE OFFENSIVE PASS INTERFERENCE WITH A PICK. &gt;&gt; Referee: ILLEGAL SHIFT. IT WILL STILL BE FOURTH DOWN. MEN IN MOTION BEFORE THE OTHER PLAYER GOT SET. &gt;&gt; Daryl: BASIC FUNDAMENTAL FOOTBALL. THAT MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TWO PEOPLE IN MOTION AT THE SAME TIME. HE DID NOT GET SET WHEN JORDAN REED LEFT TO COME IN MOTION. TWO PLAYERS MOVING, THAT'S BASIC ONEONONE FOOTBALL STUFF. YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT TYPE OF MISTAKE. IT'S LIKE UB SAID, KENNY, WHAT WAS AT STAKE. &gt;&gt; Kenny: FIRST PENALTY COMMITTED BY THE REDSKINS TODAY. RAINEY BACK DEEP. END OAF END. LET'S IT BOUNCE. IT'S A REDSKINS ROLL DOWN TO THE 11 YARD LINE. BIG FIRST HALF FOR THE TAMPA BAY BUCS. REDSKINS THREE AND OUT ON THEIR FIRST POSSESSION, HITTING MIKE EVANS. AND DONTEEA DYE, HIS FIRST NFL INTERCEPTION. &gt;&gt; Daryl: YEAH, WASHINGTON FINALLY STARTED TO GET SOME RHYTHM. IT'S SMITH WITH THE STRIP AND HOWARD JONES TAKES IT IN. RIGHT AFTER THAT IT WAS A GREAT FOLLOWUP BY KIRK COUSINS IN THIS OFFENSE. KIRK COUSINS IN FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. &gt;&gt; Kenny: NOW THE BUCS TAKE OVER WITH THE 17POINT LEAD. THIS IS SIMS. BROKE AWAY FROM GHOLSTON AND TAKES IT OUT ACROSS THE 20 YARD LINE. TIMEOUT TAKEN BY THE REDSKINS. STOP THE CLOCK WITH 1:12 REMAINING. TAMPA BAY LED BY 24 EARLY IN THIS QUARTER, THEN A 74YARD WASHINGTON DRIVE BUT THE REDSKINS LOSE RYAN KERRIGAN TO A HAND INJURY. &gt;&gt; Daryl: WE WERE HOPING YOU GET INTO THAT BYE GAME, GET HEALTHY. A LOT OF INJURIES HERE THAT THE REDSKINS WILL HAVE TO OVERCOME. BEEN A ROUGH FIRST HALF FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; Kenny: NOW AGAIN, THE BUCCANEERS WILL RECEIVE THE SECOND HALF KICKOFF. THEY HAVE THE BALL HERE WITH 1:15 REMAINING AND ALL THREE OF THEIR TIMEOUTS. ON SECOND DOWN, IT'S SIMS. AND SIMS ON THE SECOND EFFORT PICKS UP A BUCS FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THEY CONTINUED TO FALL FORWARD ON THE PREVIOUS RUN TO GET INTO THAT SECOND AND TWO PREVIOUS SITUATION. HE PICKED UP EIGHT YARDS ON THAT. TAMPA BAY HAS BEEN ABLE TO STAY AHEAD OF THE CHAINS ON DOWN AND DISTANCE ALL FIRST HALF. &gt;&gt; Kenny: 250 YARDS OF OFFENSE, OVER 200 IN THE FIRST QUARTER AS CHRIS BAKER HUSTLES TO GET OFF THE FIELD. BUCS KEEP IT ON THE GROUND WITH SIMS. AND IT'S ANOTHER TAMPA BAY FIRST DOWN. NOW TAMPA BAY WILL USE A TIMEOUT FOLLOWING THAT 13YARD RUN. IT LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE CONTENT TO LET THE HALF RUN OUT BUT NOW SIMMS PICKS UP 13. &gt;&gt; Daryl: I THINK THEY WERE. THEIR PROCESS WAS TO COME OUT, WE'RE JUST GOING TO RUN THIS FIRST HALF OUT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO COME INTO HURRY UP MODE. ALL OF A SUDDEN HE GETS YARDAGE AND BREAKS THIS ONE. WHY NOT IN THIS SITUATION NOW. I THINK THEY REALLY DID CHANGE L MINDSET THERE DURING THE PROCESS OF THIS DRIVE. WASHINGTON HAS STRUGGLED IN THE FIRST HALF GETTING DOUG MARTIN AND CHARLES TO THE GROUND. &gt;&gt; Kenny: 35 SECONDS AND TWO TIMEOUTS. IN FIELD GOAL RANGE. BUCCANEERS HAVE DOUBLED UP THE REDSKINS AS FAR AS TIME OF POSSESSION TO THIS POINT. WINSTON IN TROUBLE. THERE IS A FLAG. &gt;&gt; Referee: HOLDING OFFENSE NUMBER 74. TENYARD PENALTY, STILL FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THAT'S THE ROOKIE RIGHT GUARD OUT OF HOBART, ALI MARPET. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE PLAYS HE WOULD LIKE TO GO THROUGH THE GAME FILM AND NOT SEE THAT HAPPEN. YOU UNDERSTAND THE RULES OF THE GAME, IT GIVES THE QUARTERBACK A TON OF OPTIONS IN THE POCKET, OUTSIDE OF THE POCKET TO TAKE CONTROL AND TO GET THAT BALL THROWN AWAY CLEANLY. &gt;&gt; Kenny: SO NOW WITH 30 SECONDS REMAINING, LINE OF SCRIMMAGE IS THE 27 YARD LINE. FIRST DOWN AND 20. THERE'S SIMS. CLOCK CONTINUES TO RUN. AND THE FIRST HALF WILL COME TO AN END HERE IN LANDOVER, MARYLAND. LOVIE SMITH'S BUCCANEERS LOOKING TO MAKE IT BACKTOBACK VICTORIES. THEY TRY AND GET TO THE .500 MARK FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 2012. BOOS RAINING DOWN ON THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS AS THEY HEAD TO THE LOCKER ROOM. TWO TOUCHDOWN PASSES FOR JAMEIS WINSTON. TAMPA BAY WITH THE LEAD OVER WASHINGTON AND THE BUCCANEERS WILL RECEIVE THE SECOND HALF KICKOFF. TAMPA BAY LED BY 24 AND THEN THE REDSKINS SCORED WITH UNDER FIVE MINUTES REMAINING IN THE SECOND QUARTER. SO A BIG FIRST HALF FOR THE TAMPA BAY BUCS. WE SEND YOU TO LOS ANGELES FOR THE VISA HALFTIME REPORT. &gt;&gt; Kenny: HOMECOMING WEEKEND, HONORING ONE OF THE HOGS, RING OF HONOR, 14 YEARS WITH THE REDSKINS, A THREETIME SUPER BOWL CHAMP. TODAY'S EXCITEMENT BROUGHT TO YOU BY NISSAN. A LOT HAS HAPPENED IN THE FIRST HALF. IF YOU'RE A TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS FAN, MIKE EVANS, FIRST TOUCHDOWN OF THE SEASON, A COUPLE OF TD THROWS BY JAMEIS WINSTON. TODAY'S EXCITEMENT BROUGHT TO YOU BY NISSAN. SO THE BUCCANEERS WITH A 47 LEAD AND THEY WILL GET THE FOOTBALL FIRST IN THE SECOND HALF. KENNY ALBERT, DARYL JOHNSTON. &gt;&gt; Daryl: BOY, IF THEY EVER NEEDED A GOOD THIRD QUARTER, THEY NEED IT THIS AFTERNOON. SOMETIMES AS PLAYERS YOU JUST HAVE TO PUT EVERYTHING BEHIND YOU. WE WENT THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OF THIS WHEN I WAS WITH THE COWBOYS. WHEN WE CAME OUT IN THE SECOND HALF, WE WERE NOT PLAYING VERY WELL. EVERYBODY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT, KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO TRY TO FIX IT. SOMETIMES IT'S OUT OF YOUR CONTROL, JUST FORGET ABOUT, LET'S GO PLAY FOOTBALL. LET'S MAKE IT FOUR OUT OF FOUR AND FIGURE THAT THIRD QUARTER OUT. &gt;&gt; SHORTER HALFTIMES THAN WHEN YOU PLAYED. NOT AS MUCH TIME TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS. LAURA. &gt;&gt; Laura: WE TALKED SO MUCH ABOUT HALFTIME, WHAT DID HE TALK ABOUT WITH HIS GUYS? HE SAID IT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO GET THAT POSITIVE YARDAGE. I TOLD THEM WE'RE JUST DOWN 17, LET'S GET IT GOING AGGRESSIVELY AND PASSIONATELY. LOVIE SMITH WANTS KIRK TO KEEP THROWING AND GET MORE TO TAKE AWAY. THAT'S WHAT LOVIE PREACHED, KENNY, TAKE THE BALL AWAY. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THE BUCCANEERS WITH A DEFENSE OF TOUCHDOWN OFF THE TAKEAWAY. TAMPA BAY DOUBLES UP THE REDSKINS IN TOTAL YARDS. &gt;&gt; Daryl: I LIKE THAT GUTSY FOURTH DOWN CALL THAT THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS DID, BUT YOU HAVE THE PENALTY AND YOU TAKE IT THAT OPPORTUNITY WAY, NOW YOU HAVE TO PUNT THE BALL BACK TO TAMPA BAY. JAY GRUDEN HAS DONE EVERYTHING NECESSARY. THEY JUST HAVE TO BE CLEAN. THEY HAD A COUPLE OF KEY MISTAKES IN THAT FIRST HALF THAT PROHIBITED THEM FROM HAVING POSSESSIONS EXTEND DOWN THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; Kenny: BOBBY RAINEY BACK IN, AS THE BUCCANEERS LOOK TO EVEN THEIR RECORD AT .500, WINS OVER THE SAINTS AND THE JAGUARS THIS SEASON. REDSKINS AT 24. VICTORIES OVER THE RAMS AND THE EAGLES. SECOND HALF UNDER WAY, AS IT GOES THROUGH THE END ZONE. BUCCANEERS WILL START AT THE 20. &gt;&gt; Daryl: AND HERE'S THE PROBLEM. IN THE THIRD QUARTER IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AVERAGE YARDS PER RUSH, THERE'S THAT RUSHING GAME AGAIN. THE POINTS, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT DIFFERENTIAL RIGHT THERE. THEY'VE HAD TURNOVERS IN THE THIRD QUARTER. NOW FIVE OF THE SIX GAMES PRIOR HAS STARTED OFF LIKE THIS. THE TEAM HAS WON THE TOSS, DEFERRED, ELECTED TO TAKE IT TO START THE SECOND HALF. A COUPLE OF TIMES JAY GRUDEN WANTED TO HAVE THE WIN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. THEY NEVER REALLY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET ANYTHING GOING. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, THIS IS A HUGE SERIES. JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE BALL DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE ALLOWED TO POSSESS IT. &gt;&gt; Kenny: BUCCANEERS START FROM THE 20 YARD LINE. VINCENT JACKSON GOES UP AND COMES DOWN WITH THE FOOTBALL FOR A FIRST DOWN, A GAIN OF 14. &gt;&gt; Daryl: AGAIN, THERE WAS THAT PLAY WE TALKED ABOUT. IT'S A HARD PLAY ACTION AND SKINNY POST. SO THERE'S YOUR PLAY ACTION QUICK THROW TURN AROUND TO THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD. TWO BIG WIDE RECEIVERS. MIKE EVANS, VINCENT JACKSON, TOUGH MATCHES. &gt;&gt; Kenny: REMEMBER THE REDSKINS WITHOUT A COUPLE OF STARTING LINEBACKERS. AND NOW JEFF TRIPPLET WILL HEAD OVER. &gt;&gt; Referee: WASHINGTON IS CHALLENGING THE RULING ON THE FIELD, A COMPLETED PASS. &gt;&gt; Kenny: ONE MORE LOOK FOR YOU. AND JEFF &gt;&gt; Announcer: TODAY'S GAME ON FOX IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY: &gt;&gt; Referee: AFTER REVIEW THE RULING ON THE FIELD IS CHANGED. THE RECEIVER DID NOT MAINTAIN POSSESSION OF THE BALL, IT CAME LOOSE. IT'S AN INCOMPLETE PASS. SECOND AND TEN ON THE 20. WASHINGTON IS NOT CHARGED A TIMEOUT. &gt;&gt; Daryl: FINISHING THE PROCESS OF THE CATCH, YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN POSSESSION. YOU SEE RIGHT HERE AS IT HITS THE GROUND, LOSES CONTROL. HAND COMES OFF THE BALL. &gt;&gt; Kenny: SO JAY GRUDEN THROWS THE CHALLENGE FLAG FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS SEASON. HE WON ONLY ONE OF EIGHT CHALLENGES LAST YEAR AS A ROOKIE HEAD COACH. WINS THIS ONE. &gt;&gt; Kenny: MARTIN GETS BACK TO WHERE HE MADE THE CATCH. &gt;&gt; Daryl: IT'S SUCH A QUICK LITTLE SCREEN. YOU TRY TO SCATTER FROM WHERE YOU THINK THE BALL'S GOING TO GO. MARTIN, YOU GET IT TO HIM QUICK AND HE'S DOWN THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; Kenny: FIRST AND TN FROM THE 34 YARD LINE AGAINST A DEPLETED REDSKINS DEFENSE. HERE'S MARTIN ON FIRST DOWN. GETS A COUPLE. OUT TO THE 36. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE BIG THINGS HERE WITH THIS LEAD. TAMPA BAY IS GOING TO WANT TO LEAD ON THE RUNNING GAME. TAKE TIME OFF THAT CLOCK. POSSESS THIS. WASHINGTON IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE STOUT. IT'S BEEN A BIG QUESTION THE LAST COUPLE OF GAMES, THIS RUSH DEFENSE FOR THE WASHINGTON REASONABLE DOUBTSKINS. ON SECOND DOWN, EVANS WILL HANG ON. &gt;&gt; Kenny: WILL BLACKMON ALMOST HAD AN INTERCEPTION RIGHT &gt;&gt; Daryl: COMING ACROSS THE FIELD, HE'S BOBBLING THAT TRYING TO MAKE THE CATCH. AND BLACKMON ALMOST STEALS IT FROM HIM. &gt;&gt; Kenny: SO IT IS NOW THIRD DOWN AND NINE FOR TAMPA BAY, OPENING POSSESSION SECOND HALF. &gt;&gt; Daryl: GOT TO GET OFF THE FIELD ON THIRD AND NINE. &gt;&gt; Kenny: BUCS MUST GET TO THE 44 FOR A FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; Referee: FALSE START, NUMBER 74 OFFENSE. FIVEYARD PENALTY, STILL THIRD DOWN. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THAT'S ALI MARPET. &gt;&gt; Daryl: BOTH MOVING AROUND. FINALLY GOT ALI MARPET TO FLINCH. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THIRD DOWN AND 14 FOLLOWING THE PENALTY. WINSTON FROM THE SHOTGUN. THUMBS UP. HE'LL KEEP IT. AND HE LOSES THE FOOTBALL! WINSTON STRIPS AND THEN HE LOOKED TO RECOVER. NOW SOME MORE PUSHING AND SHOVING. AND THE FLAG AS DASHON GOLD SAN IS KNOCKED TO THE TUR OF. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THAT'S GREAT HUSTLE. GREAT STRIP RIGHT THERE. EVEN HAD IT TUCKED AWAY PRETTY WELL. &gt;&gt; Referee: AFTER THE PLAY IS OVER, PERSONAL FOUL, UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THAT'S THE HAT TRICK FOR MARPET, HIS THIRD PENALTY AS HE SHOVES GOLDSON. &gt;&gt; Daryl: IT'S A TOUGH DAY, TEMPERS PLAYER BUT YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL YOUR EMOTIONS. CAN'T THAT I CAN THOSE 15YARDERS. &gt;&gt; Kenny: MARPET'S PLAY WELL, FROM A SMALL SCHOOL. &gt;&gt; Daryl: HE HAS. THE BUCCANEERS HAVE BEEN VERY IMPRESSED WITH HIS PROGRESS HERE. THAT ONE'S EASY TO DIAL BACK. THE HARD THING IS GETTING A PLAYER IN THAT POSITION TO HAVE THAT FIERY MENTALITY. MUCH EASIER TO DIAL IT BACK THAN HAVE TO CREATE IT. SCHUM FOR THE SECOND TIME. &gt;&gt; Kenny: CROWDER DEEP FOR THE REDSKINS. CROWDER WILL LET IT BOUNCE. GOOD FIELD POSITION FOR THE REDSKINS FOLLOWING THE 40YARD PUNT. REDSKINS WILL START AT THEIR 40 AS KIRK COUSINS LEADS THE OFFENSE OUT. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THEY GOT TO BUCCANEERS OFF IN THE THIRD QUARTER. &gt;&gt; Kenny: ALSO A STRIP, TAKEN BACK FOR A DEFENSIVE SCORE. &gt;&gt; Daryl: LEADING RUSHER MATT JONES, FIVE CARRIES. HAS TO MAKE IMPROVEMENT IN THIS AREA IN THE SECOND HALF. ? . &gt;&gt; Kenny: AND JONES IS IN THE BACKFIELD. UNDER PRESSURE. GETS RID OF IT. STAYS ON HIS FEET AND MAKES HIS WAY UP TO THE 48 YARD LINE FOR A GAIN OF EIGHT. &gt;&gt; Daryl: GOING OFF THE PLAY ACTION RIGHT OFF THE START HERE, DRAGGING JORDAN REED ACROSS THE FORMATION. ALL THE PLAY ACTION GOING TO THE LEFT. YOU CAN SEE HE'S OPEN RIGHT AWAY. NOW A NICE LITTLE RUN AFTER THE CATCH HERE. GET A COUPLE MORE YARDS. &gt;&gt; Kenny: SETTING UP SECOND DOWN AND TWO. WIDE RECEIVER TRADE TO CROWDER BUT COULD NOT FOOL KWON ALEXANDER. &gt;&gt; Daryl: YOU HAVE TO MAKE ALL THE CALLS IN THE MIDDLE. THAT'S A LOT FOR A YOUNG GUY TO TAKE. THERE'S LOVIE SMITH MAKING THE CALL INTO THE DEFENSE. &gt;&gt; Kenny: REDSKINS HAVE NOT CONVERTED OFF THIRD DOWN TODAY. OFF THE FAKE TOSS TO CROWDER, THE PLAY IS BLOWN DEAD. LOOKS LIKE THE BUCS CALLED TIMEOUT. &gt;&gt; Referee: TIMEOUT, TAMPA BAY. THEIR FIRST. IT WILL BE 30 SECONDS. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THE BUCCANEERS USE A TIMEOUT ON DEFENSE. THIRD DOWN AND ONE COMING UP. COMING UP ON TUESDAY IT'S GAME ONE OF THE WORLD SERIES, NEW YORK METS AND THE KANSAS CITY ROYALS, COVERAGE OF GAME ONE BEGINS 7:30 EASTERN ON FOX. SPECIAL EXTENDED PREGAME COVERAGE. FOR THE METS, THEIR FIFTH TRIP TO THE WORLD SERIES. TO THE ROYALS, THEIR FOURTH. THEIR LAST ONE IN BACKTOBACK IN ' 85. IT WILL BE FUN TO WATCH. NEXT GAME AT CITIFIELD IN FLUSHING. THROWS. ROBERTS, WHAT A CATCH! INSIDE THE 15. HE MADE AN ADJUSTMENT. CAME AWAY WITH THE FOOTBALL AND NOW A LATE FLAG BACK BEHIND THE PLAY. &gt;&gt; Referee: 93 OF THE DEFENSE, 15 YARDS ADDED TO THE END OF THE DISTANCE. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THIRD AND SHORT SITUATION. ANDRE ROBERTS WITH THE BIG PLAY. GOOD BALL PLACEMENT BY KIRK COUSINS. YOU'RE DOWN LOW. CAN'T BE DOWN LOW AROUND THE QUARTERBACK'S LEGS. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THAT WAS McCOY. TRENT WILLIAMS, HIS TEAMMATE AT OKLAHOMA INJURED ON THE PLAY. MISSED LAST WEEK'S GAME. WITH A CONCUSSION. SO TY NSEKHE IS IN FOR WASHINGTON. &gt;&gt; Daryl: HE PLAYED LAST WEEK, CAN HE DO IT AGAIN? LET NOT PUT HIM ON AN ISLAND RIGHT AWAY. &gt;&gt; Kenny: 53YARD PLAY. 38 ON THE CATCH AND RUN BY ROBERTS. OFF THE PLAY FAKE. COUSINS. HE WAS HIT AS HE THROWS. AND THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE. NOW A FLAG HAS BEEN THROWN IN THE END ZONE. AND ANOTHER FLAG COMES OUT BACK BEHIND THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. &gt;&gt; Daryl: SOMETIMES THE PLAY IS JUST NOT THERE. IT'S A HARD PLAY ACTION. YOU'RE TRYING TO GET THE BALL INTO THE END ZONE. THEY'VE GOT IT COVERED. DOESN'T HOLD IT. DON'T ALLOW A PLAY TO HAPPEN. EVERYBODY'S CONVERING ON YOU. YOU HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR A STRIPPED PLAY BY THE BUCCANEERS. &gt;&gt; Kenny: IT'S A TOTAL OF 45 YARDS ON THE PLAY. &gt;&gt; Referee: PRIOR TO THE PASS, HOLDING NUMBER 26. THAT PENALTY IS DECLINED. DEFENSE, HALF THE DISTANCE TO THE GOAL. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; Kenny: ROUGHING THE PASSER ASSESSED TO WILLIAM GHOLSTON. &gt;&gt; Daryl: YOU SEE HOW LONG THAT PLAY TOOK. WILLIAMS GHOLSTON IS ON THE GROUND. &gt;&gt; Kenny: GHOLSTON AND COUSINS, TEAMMATES OF AT MICHIGAN STATE. FIRST AND GOAL FROM THE FOURTH. &gt;&gt; Daryl: NICE PLAY DESIGN RIGHT THERE. THAT SITUATION YOU BRING RYAN GRANT TO CROSS FORMATION. HE BREAKS FREE AND CLEAR. LAVONTE DAVID RUNNING OUT GOING WHO'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE RYAN GRANT? WHAT A GREAT START HERE IN THE THIRD QUARTER. IT GUYS MAKING PLAYS. YOU CAN TALK ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS YOU WANT TO DO TO GET THIS REMEDIED. GUYS ON THE DEFENSE MADE PLAYS, GUYS ON THE OFFENSE MADE PLAYS. &gt;&gt; Kenny: &gt;&gt; Kenny: FOUR PLAY, 60YARD DRIVE. &gt;&gt; Daryl: ONE OF THE TALKING POINTS ABOUT THE TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS WAS SECONDARY PLAY. A GREAT EXAMPLE RIGHT THERE, RYAN GRANT CROSSES FORMATION, GETS COMPLETELY DROPPED IN COVERAGE FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. &gt;&gt; Kenny: ONSIDE KICK! REDSKINS RECOVER. THAT WAS THE INITIAL SIGNAL. AND NOW IT WILL BE BUCCANEER FOOTBALL. &gt;&gt; Daryl: I'D BE SURPRISED. IT LOOKED LIKE A REDSKIN WAS RIGHT THERE TO MAKE THAT FUMBLE RECOVERY. YEAH. TRENT ROBINSON COMES OUT WITH IT, NUMBER 34. &gt;&gt; Kenny: COMING INTO THIS WEEK'S TEAM, NO TEAM HAD RECOVERED AN ONSIDE KICK. &gt;&gt; Daryl: MASON FOSTER MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE RECOVERY AND THAT WAS WELL EXECUTED. TAMPA BAY'S FRONT LINE ON THE KICKOFF RETURN UNIT STARTS TO BAIL. SO THAT'S GREAT FILM WORK AS YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE WEEK. BEN KOTWICA NOTICES THEY'RE BAILING EARLY DOWN THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; Kenny: HE SAID THEY'RE MAGIC BALLS, I DON'T KNOW HOW HE KEEPS THE BALL IN PLAY. AND THE REDSKINS COME UP WITH IT, TRAILING BY 10. COUSINS OVER THE MIDDLE! RYAN GRANT, A TOUCHDOWN MOMENTS AGO AND NOW A BIG PLAY. HE'S INSIDE THE 20 TO THE 19 YARD LINE. GRANT GAINING 32. &gt;&gt; Daryl: I TELL YOU, THIS IS A NICE TOUCH BY KIRK COUSINS. HE'S GOING TO END UP INTO THE DEEP MIDDLE OF THE FIELD, OVER THE TOP LINEBACKER, BETWEEN THE TWO SAFETIES. NICE ROUTE, NICE TOUCH BY KIRK COUSINS. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THE RED STIENS FIRST AND TEN. &gt;&gt; Referee: FALSE START OFFENSE. CAROLINA TIP TO CENTER. STILL FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; Kenny: SO JOSH, YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK. ENTIRE LINE EXCEPT THE CENTER. &gt;&gt; Daryl: EVERYBODY ELSE WAS READY TO GO ON THE PLAY. TRENT WILLIAMS MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THERE. &gt;&gt; Kenny: WILLIAMS BACK IN. FIRST DOWN AND 15. OFF THE FAKE TO JONES. COUSINS. TAKES IT DOWN TO THE 16 YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; Daryl: A NICE LITTLE CHANGEUP. YOU'RE NOT EXPECTING THIS FROM KIRK COUSINS. HE HAD THE TOUCHDOWN RUN IN THE FIRST HALF. THAT'S A BIG GAME RIGHT THERE. PENALTY ON THE RED ZONE FRINGE CAN REALLY DISRUPT THE DRIVE. KIRK COUSINS GETS SOT GOOD, POSITIVE YARDS. &gt;&gt; Kenny: YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU DON'T EXPECT IT. COMING INTO THIS. THEY EXECUTED THE FAKE WELL. SECOND DOWN AND SEVEN. THREE RECEIVERS SPLIT TO THE LEFT. IT'S CROWDER. AND JAMISON. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IN THE THIRD QUARTER HERE IS THE REDSKINS ARE JUST MAKING PLAY. KIRK COUSINS, GREAT DECISION. HERE HE ALLOWS JAMISON CROWDER TO RUN AFTER THE CATCH. HIS ACCURACY HAS BEEN QUESTIONED THE LAST COUPLE OF GAMES. &gt;&gt; Kenny: COUSINS NOW 18 OF 21. A COUPLE OF NICE RUNS AS WELL. HANDS IT OFF TO JONES. AND JONES IS TACKLED FROM BEHIND. NICE PLAY MADE BY CHRIS CONTE. HIM ONE OF THE GUYS IN THE SECONDARY THAT LOVIE SMITH HAS TALKED ABOUT, IT'S AN AREA THEY WANT TO GET SHORNERED UP. THE ONE BUY &gt;&gt; Kenny: POOR MOVEMENT. FALSE STARTS. . OFFENSE, FUM. STILL SECOND DOWN. &gt;&gt; Kenny: SO THIS TIME IT'S COUSINS. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THEY WERE ABLE TO OVERCOME THE PENALTY WHEN THEY WERE RIGHT ON THE RED ZONE FRINGE AND THEY GOT TO FIRST AND 15. CAN THEY DO IT AGAIN HERE AS THEY GET PUSHED BACK. &gt;&gt; Kenny: COUSINS SETS AND THROWS. IT IS BROKEN UP BY ALEXANDER AGAIN. AND THERE IS A FLAG. PASS INTENDED FOR ROBERTS. &gt;&gt; Referee: PRIOR TO THE PASS, HOLDING, NUMBER 58. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THAT'S ON ALEXANDER. BIG PENALTY. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN FOR THE REDSKINS. &gt;&gt; Daryl: ABSOLUTELY. BUT WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU GOT VERTICAL ROUTES, YOU GO DOWN THE FIELD INTO THE END ZONE. &gt;&gt; Kenny: WHAT A TAMPA BAY PENALTY. FIRST AND GOAL FROM. &gt;&gt; Kenny: REEVES STAYS ON HIS FEET. NOW HE'S BROUGHT IT OF. &gt;&gt; Daryl: HE WAS WIDE OPEN ON THAT ONE. YOU'VE GOT JORDAN REED INSIDE. THERE'S JOB EN, A. &gt;&gt; Kenny: TO THE END ZONE. AND &gt;&gt; Daryl: SOMETIMES UP GOT TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SUBTLE WITH YOUR FRUSTRATION. EVERYBODY KNOWS HE WANTS THAT BALL. FAN. &gt;&gt; Daryl: WE SAW HIM JUST TURN DARRELLE REVIS INDESCRIBED OUT LAST WEEKEND FOR AN EASY GOAL ON THAT PLAY. COUSINS OFF A SLANT, TOUCHDOWN JORDAN PROOEFD BOY, HE'S BEEN SORELY MISSED IN THE LINEUP BY THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS. YOU CAN SEE THE PAJICGOOD PLAY DESIGN WITH MATT JONES. WORKING JUDE ADJEIBARIMAH HAS TO CLIMB OVER TO TOP TO GET THE SEPARATION FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. &gt;&gt; Kenny: SECOND INTERCEPTION FOR REED WHO SAT OUT THE LAST TWO GAMES. HOPKINS, THE EXTRA POINT. &gt;&gt; Kenny: REDSKINS HAVE SCORED TWO TOUCHDOWNS IN THE THIRD. &gt;&gt; Daryl: HE'S BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVE WITH HIS PLAY CALLING. WENT FORWARD ON FOURTH AND TWO LATE IN THAT FIRST HALF. GOES DEEP ON THIRD AND SHORT HERE. ONSIDE KICK ON THE LAST ONE. IT'S BEEN FUN TO WATCH. YOU COME OUT NOW, NOW YOU'VE GOT A BIG DEFICIT HERE IN THE THIRD QUARTER. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO RESPONSE THAT EXECUTED PERFECTLY. NOW IT'S JORDAN RAD NOW THE OWN US IS ON JAP IT'S A GOOD JOB OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING ON. SMITH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BOOT LEG COMING OUT. GOES DOWN A LITTLE BIT BUT GETS ENOUGH FRESHER ON JAMES I DON'T SEE KBRP. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Kenny: IT'S JUST GETTING THAT FIRST FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THERE'S MARTIN ON THE TOSS. OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 25, AS WE HEAD TO LOS ANGELES TO CHECK IN WITH MIKE HILL. &gt;&gt; HEY, GUYS, JULIO JONES HASN'T HAD A CAN BE. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, THANKS VERY MUCH. HUGE THIRD DOWN COMING UP. &gt;&gt; Daryl: IT'S ALL BABY STEPS, KENNY. YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO QUIET THE CROWD AND THEN MOVING FORWARD. HERE'S THEIR LAST CHANGE FAUX TO TRY AND GET THAT DONE. &gt;&gt; Kenny: PLAY CLOCK WINDING DOWN. WINSTON ATTEMPTS TO CALL TIMEOUT BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THE FLAG WAS THROWN FIRST FOR DELAY OF GAME. PURCHASE. &gt;&gt; Referee: TIMEOUT, FAMILIAR PA. NOW DOWN TO JUST ONE TIMEOUT. THAT COULD LOOM LARGE LATER ON. BY THE WAY, THE REDSKINS HAVE 16 OF THE LAST 19 FIRST DOWNS IN THE GAME P. &gt;&gt; A LOOK AT THE PLAY CLOCK PRIOR TO THE LAST FLIGHT. SFCHLT [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] &gt;&gt; Kenny: BUCCANEERS MUST GET TO THE 30, AS WINSTON LAYS ONE UP FOR EVANS AND HE MAKES THE CATCH! MIKE EVANS QUIETS THE CROWD, PICKS PRCHL. &gt;&gt; Kenny: IT'S JUST A LOT OF CONFIDENCE. SHE COMES OUT AND PT I'M GOING TO WEAR MY. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THERE IS A FLAG. THAT'S KARLS SIMMS WHO PICKS UP FCHLTD SFCHLT. &gt;&gt; Daryl: WE'VE P WE'VE TALKED ABOUT NOT SETTING THE EDGE IN THE RUN GAME. ALSO THEIR PURSUIT ANGLES. WE SAW THIS WITH CHRIS IVORY AND THE GENERALS. &gt;&gt; Referee: NUMBER 13 IN THE BACK, THAT PENALTY IS DECLINED. HOLDING NUMBER 70 OF THE OFFENSE. THAT PENALTY IS ACCEPTED. TEN YARDS, IT WILL STILL BE FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THAT'S LOGAN MANKINS, SIXTIME PRO BOWLER WITH THE PATRIOTS. &gt;&gt; Daryl: ALL OF A SUDDEN, PLAY STARTS COMING THIS WAY AND YOU HAVE WILL BLACKMON GET UPFIELD. &gt;&gt; Kenny: I ONLY TOLD A COUPLE OF VETERANS. SO RACE IM, A 43YARD HE THROWS AND THE CATCH IS MADE BY THE TIGHT END, LUKE STOCKER. &gt;&gt; Kenny: DYE AND EVANS SPLIT OUT TO THE RIGHT. WINSTON FOR EVANS WIDE OPEN. AND MIKE EVANS HAS A TAMPA BAY FIRST DOWN. HE GOES OVER 100 YARDS FOR THE DAY. 21YARD PICK UP. &gt;&gt; Daryl: SOMETIMES THE WAY A PLAY IS DESIGNED IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT IN COVERAGE. WATCH THE TIMING ON THIS. WATCH WHEN HE SNAPS THE ROUTE OFF AND WHEN THE BALL IS DELIVERED. IT'S A GOOD PRESS AT THE TOP. LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO RELEASE TO THE OUTSIDE. YOUR CORNER HAS ALREADY OPENED HIS HIPS AND STARTED TO GO DOWNFIELD CREATES THAT SEPARATION FOR THE THROW. FIRST AND TEN FROM THE REDSKINS 35. THE TOSS TO MARTIN. MARTIN TAKES IT DOWN TO THE 30. WE WELCOME THOSE OF YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE SAINTS AND THE COLTS. TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS HAD A 240 LEAD MID WAY THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER BUT THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS HAVE BATTLED BACK WITH THE GAME'S LAST THREE TOUCHDOWNS. REDSKINS HAVE NEVER COME BACK TO WIN A GAME AFTER TRAILING BY AS MANY AS 21. DAVIS WINSTON TWO TOUCHDOWN PASSES IN THE FIRST HALF FOR TAMPA BAY. SECOND DOWN AND FIVE. WINSTON HANDS IT OFF TO MARTIN. AND DOUG MARTIN LEANS FORWARD TO THE 27 YARD LINE. IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND TWO. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THE MARK OF A REALLY GOOD RUNNING BACK IS SOMEBODY WHO CAN MAKE PEOPLE MISS IN CONFINED SPACES. THERE WAS A LINEBACKER IN THE HOLE AND HE MADE HIM MISS RIGHT THERE. NOT A BIG GAME BUT HE KEPT IT AWAY FROM BEING A NEGATIVE PLAY THAT GIVES YOU THOSE THIRD AND SHORT OPPORTUNITIES. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THIRD DOWN AND TWO FOR THE BUCS. PLAY CLOCK IS AT 2. HERE'S MARTIN. AND DOUG MARTIN HAS A TAMPA BAY FIRST DOWN. OVER 200 YARDS OF OFFENSE IN THE FIRST QUARTER. THEIR OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR. HERE TODAY THEY HAVE OUTSCORED TAMPA BAY IN THE THIRD QUARTER 140. &gt;&gt; Daryl: REALLY THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE THIS AFTERNOON COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS GAME WAS JUST GUYS STEPPING UP AND MAKING PLAYS. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THERE'S MARTIN. MARTIN LOSING HIS HELMET. BIG ONSIDE KICK EARLIER THIS QUARTER AFTER THE REDSKINS HAD SCORED A TOUCHDOWN. FIRST SUCCESSFUL ONSIDE KICK IN THE NFL THIS SEASON. KIRK COUSINS THREW HIS SECOND TOUCHDOWN OF THE QUARTER. &gt;&gt; Daryl: WELL, IT'S GOTTEN TO THIS POINT. WITH REPORTS ABOUT VINCENT JACKSON BEING OUT, THAT LEAVES MIKE EVANS AND DONTEEA DYE AS RECEIVERS. THAT CAN PLAY TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS. THEY WANT TO BE A RUNFIRST TEAM. THE REDSKINS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO STAND UP AND WIN A PHYSICAL GAME DOWN HERE IN THE STRETCH. &gt;&gt; Kenny: SECOND DOWN AND SEVEN AS WINSTON SPINS. STEPS UP. HIT AS HE THROWS. A TOUCHDOWN! THERE ARE TWO FLAGS! MIKE EVANS MAKES THE CATCH. BUT WE WILL CHECK WITH THE REFEREE, JEFF TRIPPLET. LOOKS LIKE IT'S AGAINST TAMPA BAY. &gt;&gt; Referee: PASS INTERFERENCE, OFFENSE. NUMBER 13. TENYARD PENALTY, STILL SECOND DOWN. &gt;&gt; Daryl: ONE OF THE THINGS, WHEN YOU RUSH THREE, YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE YOUR QUARTERBACK A LOT OF TIME. YOU SIDE STEP THE OTHER RUSHER THERE. SO YOU'RE GIVING YOUR QUARTERBACK A LOT OF TIME. THAT'S A LOT TO ASK YOUR SECONDARY TO COVER THAT LONG. HE'S ASKING FOR IT TO BE THROWN UP. YOU CAN SEE HIM THROW TRENTON ROBINSON TO THE SIDE, MAKE THAT CATCH. &gt;&gt; Kenny: SEASON HIGH 13th PENALTY COMMITTED BY TAMPA BAY. &gt;&gt; Daryl: IF HE WOULD HAVE STEPPED AROUND HIM, THERE WAS REALLY NO NEED TO HE COULD HAVE JUST SIDE STEPPED HIM AND MADE THAT CATCH. &gt;&gt; Kenny: HE HAS A HUNK SIZE HUGE SIZE ADVANTAGES, SEVEN INCHES. &gt;&gt; Daryl: NOW HE'S GOING TO MOVE BACK TO MAKE THAT CATCH. &gt;&gt; Kenny: SO FOLLOWING THE PENALTY, IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN AND 17. AGAINST A DEPLETED REDSKINS DEFENSE WITHOUT THEIR TWO STARTING CORNERS. THEY LOST A PAIR OF LINEBACKERS EARLIER, INCLUDING RYAN KERRIGAN, OUT WITH A BROKEN HAND. SECOND DOWN AND 17. WINSTON OUT OF THE SHOTGUN. WINSTON UNDER PRESSURE AGAIN. &gt;&gt; Daryl: ON THE PREVIOUS PLAY, THEY ONLY RUSHED THREE AND DROPPED EIGHT INTO COVERAGE. THIS TIME THEY BRING FIVE. SO YOU CRANK UP THE PRESSURE A LITTLE BIT MORE TO GET PRESSURE ON JAMEIS WINSTON. NOW YOU'RE GOING TO ADD A LINEBACKER. THAT WHOLE POCKET COLLAPSES DOWN. GOOD ADJUSTMENT BY DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR JO &gt;&gt; Kenny: FIVE OF THEIR FIRST SIX GAMES REDSKINS HAD THE LEAD AT THE HALF AND THEN STRUGGLED IN THE THIRD QUARTER. TODAY THEY TRAILED AT THE HALF AND OUTSCORED TAMPA BAY 140 IN THE THIRD. &gt;&gt; Daryl: UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS, LOST A TOSS IN THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME, TAMPA BAY DEFERRED, THEY GET THE BALL IN THE THIRD QUARTER. THIS ENTIRE TEAM OFFENSE AND DEFENSE, TREMENDOUS THIRD QUARTER. FORGET ABOUT THAT THIS WEEK. &gt;&gt; Kenny: CATCH IS MADE BY STOCKER. FORCED OUT OF BOUNDS INSIDE THE 30. GAIN OF 11. SO THE BUCCANEERS ARE IN FIELD GOAL RANGE LEADING BY 3. &gt;&gt; Daryl: LOVIE SMITH TOLD US THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE GAMES THAT WAS GOING TO GO TO THE TOUGHEST TEAM. YOUR CORNER TAKING ON A BIG TIGHT END RIGHT THERE, LET YOUR PLAYERS RALLY UP BEHIND YOU. &gt;&gt; Kenny: SO HERE IS CONNOR BARTH. 45YARD ATTEMPT TO GET FROM 22 BACK IN THE FIRST QUARTER. BUCCANEERS LOOK TO PUMP THE PLAY CLOCK BACK UP. AND JEFF TRIPPLET DOES JUST THAT. FROM THE LEFT HASH. SCHUM FUTURES DOWN AND &gt;&gt; Announcer: TODAY'S GAME SPONSORED BY: &gt;&gt; Daryl: THAT'S A NICE SETTING FOR A LITTLE FLAG FOOTBALL GAME RIGHT THERE, THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT. &gt;&gt; Kenny: SURE IS. HAVE YOU EVER TAKEN THE ELEVATOR ALL THE WAY UP? &gt;&gt; Daryl: YOU KNOW, I HAVE NOT. WE TALKED ABOUT THAT YESTERDAY. I HAVE NOT BEEN TO THE TOP OF THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT. &gt;&gt; Kenny: HAVE TO TRY AND MAKE IT WORK. WE'LL BE BACK A COUPLE OF TIMES IN NOVEMBER. &gt;&gt; Daryl: WE'LL PUT IT ON THE CALENDAR. &gt;&gt; Kenny: SIXPOINT GAME. REDSKINS WILL START FROM THE 20. &gt;&gt; Kenny: REDSKINS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OUTSCORED, EIGHT THIRD DOWNS IN THE THIRD QUARTER FOR WASHINGTON. &gt;&gt; Daryl: WHAT WAS DIFFERENT YESTERDAY IN THAT THIRD QUARTER? HOPEFULLY THEY CAN PUT THAT WHOLE THING TO BED AND NOT HAVE TO BE BOTHERED WITH IT. &gt;&gt; Kenny: NOW WE'LL SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO IN THE FOURTH. START FROM THE 20 AS COUSINS HANDS IT OFF. MATT JOHNS FOUND A BIG HOLE. PICKS UP A REDSKINS FIRST DOWN. A LATE FLAG IS THROWN AT THE END OF THE PLAY. &gt;&gt; Referee: AFTER THE PLAY WAS OVER, PERSONAL FOUL. UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS, NUMBER 92 ON THE DEFENSE. 15YARDS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PLAY. FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; Kenny: SECOND TIME WILLIAM GHOLSTON HAS BEEN FOULED. CHECK UP ON THE PATRIOTS. &gt;&gt; JETS HAVE ADDED A FIELD GOAL. IT'S 2016 JETS IN THE FOURTH. &gt;&gt; Kenny: IVORY A BIG DAY AGAINST THE REDSKINS LAST WEEK. ON FIRST DOWN HERE'S MORRIS. WE HAVEN'T SEEN ALFRED MORRIS IN A WHILE. IT HAS BEEN ALL JONES HERE IN THE SECOND HALF. &gt;&gt; Daryl: KIND OF PICKING UP RIGHT WHERE MATT JONES LEFT OFF. SOME POSITIVE YARDS IN THE RUNNING GAME. NOW THE PLAY BEFORE THE BIG RUN BY MATT JONES, KEEP YOUR EYES ON NUMBER 92 COMING IN LATE ON TOP AND AFTER THAT PLAY, MATT JONES KIND OF WALKED OFF THE FIELD A LITTLE SLOW. &gt;&gt; Kenny: NOW JONES IS BACK IN FOLLOWING THAT HIT FROM GHOLSTON. 14 TAMPA BAY SECOND AND FIVE. SO JONES CONTINUES TO RUN HARD. GREW UP IN THE TAMPA AREA. THIRD ROUN PICK AND HE'S HAD A NICE AFTERNOON. &gt;&gt; Daryl: YOU EVENTUALLY RUN OUT OF REAL ESTATE. SO NOW THE REDSKINS FACING THIRD DOWN AND ONE, TRAILING BY 6, AFTER TRAILING BY 24 IN THE SECOND QUARTER. REDSKINS SEND IN AN EXTRA BLOCKER, NUMBER 68, TOM COME TON. THIRD AND ONE. INSIDE HANDOFF TO THE FULLBACK, DARREL YOUNG. MICHIGAN GOOD JOB KEEPING YOUR BODY UPRIGHT SO YOU DOESN'T FALL. THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT THERE WHEN HE GETS UP TO THE LINE AND GETS IN BEHIND EVERYBODY. HE WENT DOWN LOW FOR THAT ONE. &gt;&gt; Kenny: FINALLY THE FIRST DOWN SIGNAL. SO A NEW SET OF DOWNS FOR JAY GRUDEN'S REDSKINS. OFF THE FACE OF JONES. COUSINS THROWS ACROSS THE FIELD. HE WAS LOOKING FOR THE TIGHT END JORDAN REED, AS COUSINS GETS BACK UP ON TO HIS FEET. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THEY WERE READY FOR THIS ONE. YOU'RE GOING TO COME RIGHT INTO THE FACE OF THAT BOOT LEG. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT CONTAIN OR ANYTHING. &gt;&gt; Kenny: NOW SECOND AND TEN FROM THE TAMPA BAY 44. PASS IS CAUGHT AT THE 40, SPINNING AND TAKING IT DOWN TO THE 38 YARD LINE IS REED. SETTING UP THIRD DOWN AND FOUR FOR WASHINGTON. &gt;&gt; Daryl: YOU SEE THE IMPACT HE'S HAD TO THE STARTING LINEUP HERE. DEFINITELY SOMETHING COUSINS IS COMFORTABLE THROWING THE BALL WITH. THROWN TO SEVEN TIMES, SIX CATCHES. IN SITUATIONS, HE'S THE GUY THAT HAD THE TOUCHDOWN CATCH AT THE END OF THE FIRST HALF. &gt;&gt; Kenny: REDSKINS MUST GET TO THE 34 FOR A FIRST DOWN. FIRES! THE CATCH IS MADE BY PIERRE GARCON, WHO PICKS UP THE FIRST. 15YARD PASS PLAY. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THEY'VE GOT TO KEEP HIM INVOLVED BECAUSE LAST WEEK AGAINST THE JETS HE KIND OF DISAPPEARED THERE IN THE SECOND HALF. HE'S AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN WORKING AGAINST MIKE JENKINS. IT'S ALSO A NICE JOB BY KIRK COUSINS STEPPING UP IN THAT POCKET GETS IT ON THE BACK SHOULDERS AS ALEXANDER'S TRYING TO CLOSE THAT THROWING LANE DOWN. THAT'S A TIGHT WINDOW TO FIT THAT IN. &gt;&gt; Kenny: FIRST AND TEN, 23 YARD LINE. BOTTLED UP, CANNOT MAKE IT BACK TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THE BIG LESSON TODAY, THIS CROWD STARTING TO RAIN DOWN SOME BOOS ON THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS. HE'S TALKED, HE'S SEEN PATIENCE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME WASHINGTON WAS NOT PLAYING WELL IN ANY PHASE. JAY GRUDEN STAYED WITH KIRK COUSINS AND PAID OFF WITH THIS OPPORTUNITY HERE ON THIS DRIVE. &gt;&gt; Kenny: EMPTY BACKFIELD FROM THE SHOTGUN ON SECOND DOWN AND 11. AND A NICE TACKLE MADE BY LAVONTE DAVID. &gt;&gt; Daryl:ISM THINK THE BIG THING THAT GRUDEN SHARED WITH US IS THERE'S NOTHING POSITIVE ABOUT HIM. THAT'S WHY HE WAS WORRIED WHERE HE WAS AT WITH A FRAME OF MIND. THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT JAY WAS TRYING TO CREATE WITH HIS GAME PLAN THIS AFTERNOON. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THIRD DOWN AND 19. REDSKINS MUST GET TO THE 14. THE PLAY IS BLOWN DEAD. &gt;&gt; Referee: DELAY OF GAME OFFENSE. &gt;&gt; Kenny: REDSKINS TOOK TOO MUCH TIME. IS T IS NOW THIRD DOWN AND 14. &gt;&gt; Daryl: YOU'RE ON THAT RED ZONE FRINGE AREA. NO REASON FOR TO YOU HAVE A DELAY OF GAME PENALTY IN THAT POSITION. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THIRD AND 14. BROUGHT DOWN SHY OF THE FIRST BY BRADLEY McDOUGAL. HE NEEDED 14 AND GAINED TEN. HIM KIRK COUSINS HAS DONE A NICE JOB THIS AFTERNOON OF CLIMBING UP IN THE POCKED. MOVES UP, FINDS JORDAN REED. WATCH THE HUSTLELE BY LAVONTE DAVID. &gt;&gt; Kenny: SO DUSTIN HOPKINS OUT TO ATTEMPT A 35YARD FIELD GOAL TO PULL THE REDSKINS WITHIN THREE. ONE OF THE BUCS WAS RUNNING OFF THE FIELD. JUST MADE IT OFF. &gt;&gt; Daryl: YES, HE DID. &gt;&gt; Kenny: A FOURTH AND FOUR SITUATION, TAMPA BAY VERY, VERY LUCKY. ALMOST ANOTHER KIND OF PERSONNEL SITUATION THAT WOULD HAVE GIVEN WASHINGTON THE FIRST DOWN ON THE PENALTY ON THAT, THEY'RE RUSHING THE PLAYER OUT ON TO THE FIELD AND THAT FIELD GOAL SITUATION, THEY WERE ABLE TO GET HIM OFF RIGHT BEFORE THE KICK. RAINEY TAKES IT OUT. THERE IS A FLAG. JUST SHY OF THE 20. TWO FLAGS THROWN. BUSY DAY FOR JEFF TRIPPLET AND HIS CREW. &gt;&gt; Referee: HOLDING NUMBER 31 ON THE RETURN TEAM, HALF THE DISTANCE TO THE GOAL. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THAT'S THE 15th TAMPA &gt;&gt; Kenny: LOVIE SMITH'S BUCS, 138 YARDS IN PENALTIES, FOURTH MOST IN TEAM HISTORY. THEY'VE COMMITTED 15. FRANCHISE RECORD IS 16 IN ONE GAME. &gt;&gt; Daryl: FIVE OF THOSE ARE PERSONAL FOULS, TOO, KENNY. &gt;&gt; Kenny: A LOT OF FLAGS. BUCCANEERS SWINGING TO A THREEPOINT LEAD. FIRST AND TEN FROM THE 6 YARD LINE. OUT TO THE 9. GHOLSTON THE TACKLE. SUNDAY AFTERNOON GAMES RIGHT ON YOUR SMARTPHONE WITH NFL MOBILE. BUCCANEERS LED 240. REDSKINS HAVE NEVER COME BACK TO WIN A GAME AFTER TRAILING BY MORE THAN 21. SECOND DOWN AND SEVEN WITH UNDER SEVEN MINUTES TO PLAY. OFF THE PLAY FAKE. WINSTON. AIRING IT OUT ON SECOND DOWN. TOO FAR FOR MIKE EVANS. &gt;&gt; Daryl: WILL BLACKMON, KIND OF ONEONONE WITH MIKE EVANS. YOU RUN THE DOUBLE MOVE ON THE OUTSIDE. REMEMBER MIKE EVANS HAS BEEN BATTLING SOME FLULIKE SYMPTOMS ALL DAY. WE HAD REPORTS THAT HE GOT SICK ON THE SIDELINE IN THE FIRST HALF. PROBABLY DEHYDRATED. YOU COULD SEE HOW TIRED HE WAS. VINCENT JACKSON IS ON THE SIDELINE RIGHT NOW, INJURED. LEWIS MURPHY'S ON THE SIDELINE INJURED. THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MORE WIDE RECEIVERS LEFT FOR THE TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS. &gt;&gt; Kenny: DONTEEA DYE. MIKE EVANS MAKES THE CATCH FOR A TAMPA BAY FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; Daryl: WORKING AGAINST GREELAND. &gt;&gt; Kenny: IT'S MARTIN FOR A GAME OF TWO. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THE OFFENSIVE LINE FOR THE TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS, THEY'RE GOING TO BE THE KEY DOWN THE STRETCH. AND CAN THIS REDSKINS RUSH DEFENSE, THEY'VE BEEN CRITICIZED FOR THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS. WE TALKED ABOUT THE THIRD QUARTER STRUGGLES. THE OTHER BIG TOPIC OF CONVERSATION IS WASHINGTON'S RUN DEFENSE. CAN THEY RISE UP RIGHT HERE? &gt;&gt; Kenny: SECOND DOWN AND EIGHT. CAUGHT BY THE TIGHT END STOCKER. MOVE STOCKER OUT TO THE 32. YOU HAVE TO GIVE THIS WASHINGTON DEFENSE CREDIT. THEY ALLOWED OVER 200 YARDS IN THE FIRST QUARTER ALONE. SINCE THEN LESS THAN 200 OVER THE LAST THREE QUARTERS, SO THEY CLAMPED DOWN. &gt;&gt; Daryl: AND MISSING SOME KEY GUYS IN THE DEFENSE. THAT WAS A NICE PLAY, MOVING INSIDE OUT IN COVERAGE. TACKLED FOR A SHORT GAIN. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THEY LOST RYAN KERRIGAN EARLIER. THEY LOST KEENAN ROBINSON FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. HE HAS COME BACK WITHOUT THEIR TWO STARTING CORNERS. THIRD DOWN AND THREE AND NOW RUNNING OUT ON TO THE FIELD &gt;&gt; Referee: TAMPA BAY CALLED THEIR FINAL TIMEOUT. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THE BUCS USE THEIR FINAL TIMEOUT BUT NOBODY NOTIFIED THE &gt;&gt; Kenny: BUCCANEERS USE THEIR FINAL TIMEOUT, WHICH MEANS IF ANYTHING COMES UP OVER THE NEXT 2:45, LOVIE SMITH CANNOT CHALLENGE. TAMPA BAY FACING A THIRD DOWN AND THREE. LEADING BY THREE. WINSTON ON THIRD DOWN THROWS AND THE CATCH IS MADE BY EVANS AND THERE IS A FLAG. BREELAND ALL OVER HIM. EVANS ALL OVER HIM. &gt;&gt; Daryl: TOP OF THE SCREEN, MIKE EVANS WORKING AGAINST BASHAUD GREELAND. HE HAD HIS HAND ON HIS WAIST. I DON'T THINK HE PULLED HIM. AGAIN, HATS OFF TO MEEK EVANS. HE WAS NOT IN GREAT SHAPE IN THAT FIRST QUARTER WITH SOME OF HIS ISSUES THERE WITH HIS STOMACH, AND HE IS THE ONLY GUY LEFT EXCEPT DONTEEA DYE, WHO'S MAKING HIS FIRST APPEARANCE. &gt;&gt; Kenny: SO THE FLAG PICKED UP. NEW SET OF DOWNS FOR THE BUCS. FROM THEIR 46 YARD LINE. ON FIRST DOWN IT'S MARTIN! HE BREAKS THROUGH. HE'S INSIDE THE 30. STILL GOING. INSIDE THE 10 AND FINALLY WRESTLED DOWN BY BASHAUD BREELAND. BREELAND STILL DOWN. MARTIN GAINS 49. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THEY HAD SOMEBODY COMING. TRENT ROBINSON IS RIGHT HERE. THAT BALL'S GOING TO BREAK RIGHT BACK INTO THAT SPOT. YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY HAVE THE PLAYER THERE FOR RUN SUPPORT. IN THAT SITUATION HE COMES UP. HE GETS TOO FAR INSIDE. THIS IS THE BAD ANGLE RIGHT THERE. YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT GAP. YOU HEAR GUYS TALK ABOUT RUN FITS AND GAP CONTROL. ROBINSON HAD THAT INSIDE GAP. HE WAS JUST TOO FLAT. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THIRD STRAIGHT HUNDREDYARD GAME FOR WILLIAMS. REDSKINS ALREADY DECIMATED IN THE SECOND. MIKE? &gt;&gt; COWBOYS STRUGGLING, TRYING TO END A THREEGAME LOSING STREAK, TAKING ON OBJ. THAT GAME NEXT ON FOX. BACK TO YOU. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THANKS, MIKE. REDSKINS WILL HAVE A CLOSE EYE ON THAT ONE. SO WILL WE. EAGLES, GIANTS, 33. COWBOYS, 23 AND THE REDSKINS FOR THE MOMENT AT TWO UP AND FOUR DOWN AS BREELAND HEADS TO THE SIDELINES. &gt;&gt; Daryl: YOU CAN SEE IF WASHINGTON CAN PULL THIS GAME OUT THIS AFTERNOON. DALLAS WINS THAT TO GET TO 33. THE NFC JUST BECOMES MORE JUMBLED. &gt;&gt; Kenny: TALKED ABOUT THE REDSKINS INJURY WAHL HALL AND CULLIVER AND NOW WITHOUT &gt;&gt; Daryl: YOU HAVE TO HOLD TAMPA BAY TO A FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT HERE. &gt;&gt; Kenny: FIRST AND GOAL FROM THE FIVE FOLLOWING THE 49YARD RUN BY MARTIN. FOUR MINUTES REMAINING. ON FIRST DOWN IT'S MARTIN. AND HE TAKES IT DOWN INSIDE THE 2. BUCCANEERS SEND IN SOME BIG BODIES. &gt;&gt; Daryl: HE MADE SOME YARDS OUT OF NOTHING RIGHT THERE ON THAT ONE, TOO. &gt;&gt; Kenny: SECOND AND GOAL. THE FULLBACK JORVORSKIE LANE IS IN. &gt;&gt; Daryl: A LITTLE BIT OF PENETRATION HERE, FLATTENS HIM OUT. WE'VE SEEN HIM REALLY FINISH RUNS TOUGH. GOOD PURSUIT INSIDEOUT. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THIRD AND GOAL WITH UNDER THREE MINUTES REMAINING. TENTH PLAY OF THE DRIVE. STARTED AT THEIR OWN 6. NOW SIMS IN THE BACKFIELD WITH THE FULLBACK LANE. THE TOSS TO CHARLES SIMS, AND HE IS STOPPED BY DASHON GOLDSON! &gt;&gt; Daryl: LATE SHIFT BY THE FULLBACK. IS IT A TELLTALE FOR THAT DEFENSE? BECAUSE THE RIGHT SIDE JUST EXPLODES UPFIELD INTO THE BACKFIELD. WATCH THE LATE SHIFT RIGHT HERE. AND THEN WATCH THIS GROUP JUST PUSH STRAIGHT INTO THE BACKFIELD. &gt;&gt; Kenny: NOW, THE REDSKINS USE A TIMEOUT. THE BUCCANEERS' OFFENSE IS STILL OUT ON THE FIELD. IT IS FOURTH AND GOAL FROM THE 3 WITH TAMPA BAY LEADING BY 3. HOW ABOUT THIS DECISION BY LOVIE SMITH. &gt;&gt; Daryl: TOUCHDOWN MAKES IT A TWOPOSSESSION GAME. NO TIMEOUT. &gt;&gt; Kenny: HERE COMES THE FIELD GOAL UNIT AFTER A DELAY LED THE OFFENSE OUT. TRY AND MAKE IT A 6POINT GAME. &gt;&gt; Kenny: WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE? &gt;&gt; Daryl: IT TAKES A LOT OF GUTS. YOU BETTER HAVE CONFIDENCE. IF THE LAST PLAY WASN'T A NEGATIVE PLAY, I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT A LITTLE LONGER. MAKE WASHINGTON GO THE LENGTH OF THE FIELD. SCORE A TOUCHDOWN TO BEAT YOU. &gt;&gt; Kenny: HERE'S BARTH, A 21YARD ATTEMPT FROM THE LEFT EDGE. 6POINT LEAD FOR TAMPA BAY. WITH 2:24 REMAINING HERE IN LANDOVER. &gt;&gt; Kenny: 2:24 REMAINING FOURTH QUARTER. KENNY ALBERT, DARYL JOHNSTON, LAURA OKMIN HERE, WE WELCOME THOSE OF YOU WHO JUST JOINED US. THE REDSKINS WILL GET THE BALL BACK DOWN BY 6. TAMPA BAY WITH A DEFENSIVE TOUCHDOWN THAT EXTENDED THEIR LEAD TO 240. REDSKINS LOSE A LEADER ON THE DEFENSIVE SIDE, RYAN KERRIGAN. AND THE REDSKINS WITH TWO TOUCHDOWNS AND A FIELD GOAL. THEY RECOVERED AN ONSIDE KICK LEADING TO THEIR SECOND TOUCHDOWN IN THE THIRD QUARTER. &gt;&gt; Daryl: JAY GRUDEN HAS PREACHED PATIENCE TO THE FAN BASE. IT WAS REWARDED WHEN THEY WERE DOWN 24 TO GET TO THIS POINT. NOW HE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING HIS TEAM BACK FROM THE LARGEST DEFICIT IN FRANCHISE HISTORY. &gt;&gt; Kenny: FIRST AND TEN, 20 YARD LINE. TO THE OUTSIDE. AND IT IS MATT JONES WHO MAKES THE CATCH FOR A GAIN OF 6. &gt;&gt; Kenny: I WANT TO SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE URGENCY RIGHT HERE. HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET MORE THAN ONE PLAY BEFORE THE TWOMINUTE WARNING HERE. IT WAS A BAD LOCATION ON THE THROW DOWN LOW. &gt;&gt; Kenny: REDSKINS GET THE SNAP OFF PRIOR TO THE TWOMINUTE WARNING. SO WE HAVE HIT OF TWOMINUTE &gt;&gt; Kenny: WELCOME BACK. ENTERTAINING GAME HERE IN LANDOVER, MARYLAND. BUCCANEERS JUMPED OUT TO A 240 LEAD. REDSKINS NOW ATTEMPTING TO DRIVE DOWNFIELD, TRAILING BY 6. COUSINS ON FIRST DOWN COMPLETE. IT'S REED AGAIN. WE WELCOME THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE JUST JOINED US, KENNY ALBERT, DARYL JOHNSTON, LAURA OKMIN. IT'S NOW A 6POINT GAME WITH THE REDSKINS DRIVING. 1:40 REMAINING. WASHINGTON IN NEED OF A TOUCHDOWN. COUSINS TO ANDRE ROBERTS. AND HE SKIPS INTO BUCCANEERS TERRITORY. &gt;&gt; Daryl: I'VE BEEN IMPRESSED WITH KIRK COUSINS IN THE POCKET TODAY. THERE ARE TIMES HE'S STOOD IN THERE AND TAKEN BIG HITS. HE'S CLIMBED THE POCKET WELL. HE'S TAKEN ANOTHER STEP. JAY GRUDEN HAS TALKED ABOUT WANTING TO SEE HIM IMPROVE, BE PATIENT WITH HIM. WE TALKED ABOUT CONFIDENCE AT THE TOP OF THIS GAME. WASHINGTON HAVING CONFIDENCE GOING INTO THEIR BYE. IF THEY PULL THIS WIN OUT, THEY'RE GOING TO BE ON CLOUD NINE. &gt;&gt; Kenny: NINE STRAIGHT COMPLETIONS FOR COUSINS. IT'S PIERRE GARCON INSIDE THE 40. SO KIRK COUSINS NOW 29 OF 34 WITH SO MANY OF THE GREAT REDSKIN QUARTERBACKS ON HAND TODAY AS WE TAKE ONE MORE LOOK. &gt;&gt; Daryl: THE ODD THING NOW IS YOU'RE ALLOWING SOFT COVERAGE ALONG THE SIDELINE. YOU'RE ALSO NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF BOUNDS AND STOP THE CLOCK. YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE THEM WORK THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD SO THAT CLOCK CAN KEEP RUNNING. WASHINGTON'S BEEN ABLE TO THROW CATCH AND ON THE SIDELINES PRESERVE THOSE TIMEOUTS. &gt;&gt; Kenny: FROM THE 38 ON FIRST DOWN. ANOTHER COMPLETION. 30th OF THE DAY FOR COUSINS. IT'S JORDAN REED. DOWN TO 1:15 REMAINING. TENTH CATCH FOR REED AND HIS RETURN AFTER MISSING THE LAST TWO. THAT'S A NEW CAREER HIGH. &gt;&gt; Referee: NEUTRAL ZONE INFRACTION, 94 DEFENSE. FIVEYARD PENALTY RESULTS IN A FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; Kenny: THAT IS THE 16th BUCCANEERS PENALTY. THAT'S A RECORD THERE. &gt;&gt; Daryl: SOMETIME THESE GUYS GET SO DIALED IN ON THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT, WHETHER IT'S A FINGER OR A FOOT LIKE THAT RIGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; Kenny: FIRST AND TEN FROM THE 27 YARD LINE. COUSINS TO THE OUTSIDE. IT'S ROBERTS. &gt;&gt; Daryl: YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL WITH THAT THROW RIGHT NOW. THAT'S A LONG THROUGH TLOE ACROSS THE FIELD. A LONG THROW ACROSS THE FIELD. YOU MIGHT BE STARTING TO GET BAITED. THEY CAN LURE YOU INTO A THROW THAT THEY CAN JUMP. &gt;&gt; Kenny: 11 STRAIGHT COMPLETIONS FOR KIRK COUSINS. FROM THE BUCCANEERS' 4. COUSINS LOOKING FOR CROWDER AND JAMISON CROWDER MAKES THE CATCH INSIDE THE TAMPA BAY 10! &gt;&gt; Daryl: GREAT ANTICIPATION WITH THE PLAY CALL. YOU CATCH TAMPA IN A BIG BLITZ AND RUN THAT PLAY WITH THE DEFAULT COMING OUT OF THE SLOT. &gt;&gt; Kenny: AND NOW THE REDSKINS WILL USE A TIMEOUT WITH 35 SECONDS REMAINING. &gt;&gt; Daryl: TAMPA BAY WALKING EVERYBODY UP INTO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. YOU'VE GOT THE PERFECT PLAY CALL ON. GREAT ANTICIPATION, GOING TO COME ALL THE WAY FROM THE INSIDE HERE TO GET VERTICAL. AND WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE THROWS THAT KIRK COUSINS HAS MADE HERE IN THE SECOND HALF. THAT'S ANOTHER ONE THAT HE DROPS IN OVER THE TOP, JAMISON CROWDER HAD A REAL NICE THROW IN THE THIRD QUARTER, OVER THE LINEBACKER, BETWEEN THE TWO SAFETIES. &gt;&gt; Kenny: COUSINS NOW 32 OF 37 WITH DOUG WILLIAMS, MARK GRIFFIN, JAY SLADER, ALL IN THE STADIUM. SO MANY OF THE REDSKIN GREATS AT HIS POSITION. ON HOMECOMING WEEKEND. COUSINS NOW ONE SHY OF A FRANCHISE RECORD FOR COMPLETIONS IN ONE GAME. FIRST AND GOAL FROM THE 6. COUSINS THE END ZONE. HE WAS LOOKING FOR REED. BRADLEY McDOUGALD ON THE COVERAGE. &gt;&gt; Daryl: SIZE, STRENGTH, ATHLETIC ABILITY. A LITTLE TOO FAR THERE. GOOD, TIGHT COVERAGE. &gt;&gt; Kenny: NOW SECOND AND GOAL. 32 SECONDS REMAINING. REDSKINS TRAILING THE BUCCANEERS BY 6. REDSKINS HAVE NEVER COME BACK TO WIN AFTER TRAILING BY MORE THAN 21. COUSINS ON SECOND AND GOAL. FIRES. AND IT'S INCOMPLETE. CONTE GOT A HAND ON IT. &gt;&gt; Daryl: I THINK THAT WAS INTENDED FOR JAMISON CROWDER. THEY GOT LUCKY RIGHT THERE. HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN A SPOT FOR AN INTERCEPTION. &gt;&gt; Kenny: REDSKINS NOW FACE THIRD AND GOAL FROM THE TAMPA BAY 6. FOUR RECEIVERS. THE TIGHT END REED TO THE RIGHT. LOOKING FOR REED. HE'S GOT IT. TOUCHDOWN! &gt;&gt; Daryl: THEY CAUGHT TAMPA BAY A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED WITH THEIR COVERAGE RIGHT THERE. YOU PUT THAT FOURPERSON BUNCH TO THE LEFT SIDE. THEY HAD DIFFICULTY GETTING THINGS SORTED OUT TO THE SINGLE RECEIVER SIDE. YOU GOT THIS BIG FOURMAN BUNCH ON THIS SIDE. JORDAN REED IS BY HIMSELF OPPOSITE BUT THERE WAS CONFUSION ON WHAT TO DO FROM A COVERAGE STANDPOINT. AND LAVONTE DAVID IS A LITTLE BIT LATE GETTING THERE. HEAVY OUTSIDE LEVERAGE BY THE CORNER IN THAT SITUATION SO THE DISTRACTION WITH THE HEAVY BUNCH TO THE TOP MADE THINGS A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING DOWN BELOW THERE. &gt;&gt; Kenny: IT IS NO LONGER A GIMME, THE 33YARD EXTRA POINT. DUSTIN HOPKINS FOR THE LEAD. REDSKINS WITH THE LEAD BY 1. 24 SECONDS REMAINING. &gt;&gt; Daryl: I'VE BEEN SO IMPRESSED BY WASHINGTON'S ABILITY, THE RESILIENCY THIS AFTERNOON. A 240 AND TO GET TO 24, THE ONE GOOD DRIVE THEY HAD THE ENTIRE FIRST HALF UP UNTIL THAT POINT, A STRIP SACK RETURN FUMBLE FOR A TOUCHDOWN FOR TAMPA BAY, TO GET TO 24 AND THEY HAVE BOUNCED BACK. IT HAS BEEN VERY IMPRESSIVE TO WATCH. IT WAS ALL TAMPA BAY. THEY CAME OUT AND THEY WERE ON FIRE. HERE'S THAT LAST PLAY TO GET TO 24. SMITH WITH THE SACK STRIP. HOWARD JONES PICKS IT UP. THAT MAKES IT 240. AND KIRK COUSINS STARTS THE COMEBACK. AND IT HAS TO GO THROUGH THE TROUBLESOME THIRD QUARTER FOR WASHINGTON. THE ONLY SUCCESSFUL ONSIDE KICK SO FAR THIS YEAR IN THE NFL HELPS OUT. THEY GET RID OF SOME OF THOSE ISSUES IN THE THIRD QUARTER WITH 14 POINTS AND THEN ON THAT LAST DRIVE. LET'S NOT FORGET FIRST AND GOAL AT THE 5 YARD LINE AFTER THE BIG RUN BY DOUG MARTIN, THE REDSKINS' DEFENSE HUNKERS DOWN AND FORCES THE FIELD GOAL TO ALLOW THEM TO COME BACK ON A TOUCHDOWN DRIVE AND TAKE THE LEAD 3130. &gt;&gt; Kenny: 24 SECOND HALF POINTS COUSINS TIES JASON CAMPBELL'S COMPLETIONS FOR ONE GAME. SO THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS WHO HAVE NEVER COME BACK FROM A DEFICIT OF MORE THAN 21 TO WIN A GAME NOW LEAD BY 1. THERE IS JORDAN REED WHO HAS HAD A HUGE DAY, 11 RECEPTIONS, 2 TOUCHDOWNS. NOW THE BUCCANEERS WITH NO TIMEOUTS SEND THEIR OFFENSE BACK ON TO THE FIELD WITH ON 24 SECONDS REMAINING. &gt;&gt; Daryl: AND WE TALKED ABOUT THEIR SITUATION AT WIDE RECEIVER DURING THE COURSE OF THE GAME NOT AN ISSUE. THEY'RE GOING TO USE PLAY ACTION. THEY CAN BE SERVICEABLE WHEN THEY ONLY HAD MIKE EVANS AND DONTEEA DYE. BUT IN THIS SITUATION, YOU NEED ALL HANDS ON DECK. THEY ARE SHORT AT WIDE RECEIVER. THEY'LL HAVE TO GO WITH TIGHT END IN SOME OF THOSE POSITIONS. AND AGAIN, THE MISMANAGEMENT OF TIMEOUTS DURING THE COURSE OF THE HALF PUTS THEM IN THIS POSITION, 24 SECONDS, NEEDING A FIELD GOAL, ZERO TIMEOUTS. &gt;&gt; Kenny: WINSTON ON FIRST DOWN. IT'S EVANS. IKE EVANS WITH HIS EIGHTH CATCH OF THE DAY OUT TO THE 36 YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; Kenny: WELL, THAT WAS TOO EASY. BARTH'S CAREER LONGEST, A 57YARD FIELD GOAL. SO THEY NEED TO GET 24 MORE YARDS TO GET TO A FIELD GOAL, ONLY 18 SECONDS REMAINING. FROM THE 36. COMPLETE TO THE TIGHT END CAMERON BRATE. &gt;&gt; Daryl: YOU'VE GOT COMFORTABLY TWO PLAYS DEPENDING ON THE DISTANCE DOWN THE FIELD. MAYBE THREE PLAYS IN THIS SITUATION RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; Kenny: MIGHT BE TOO LITTLE TIME FOR THREE PLAYS. &gt;&gt; Daryl: DEPENDING ON THE DISTANCE THEY WANT TO TAKE THEM DOWN THE FIELD, WORKING THAT SIDELINE. CAN YOU GET IT OUT THREE, FOUR SECONDS. &gt;&gt; Kenny: SECOND DOWN AND FOUR. WINSTON TAKES SOME TIME. GOES OVER THE MIDDLE FOR SIMS. NOW THEY'RE IN FIELD GOAL RANGE. DON'T HAVE A TIMEOUT. BALL COMES LOOSE! REDSKINS RECOVER AND WILL BE ABLE TO PUT THE EXCLAMATION POINT ON THE BIGGEST COMEFROMBEHIND WIN IN FRANCHISE HISTORY. &gt;&gt; Daryl: I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS ONE OF THOSE PLAYS SET UP TO START. THE WASHINGTON DEFENSE DON'T ALLOW THEM ON THE OUTSIDE WITH THE ABILITY TO MAKE THE CATCH AND STEP OUT OF BOUNDS. IF YOU WANT THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD, GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT. &gt;&gt; Kenny: NOW THERE WERE 12 SECONDS REMAINING AT THE START OF THAT PLAY. LOOKED LIKE THE CLOCK DID NOT RUN DOWN AS LONG AS IT SHOULD SO WE'LL CHECK IN WITH JEFF TRIPPLET. AGAIN, THERE WERE 12 SECONDS AT THE START OF THE PLAY. ALL TURNOVERS ARE REVIEWED. &gt;&gt; Referee: THE CLOCK DID NOT START ON THE PREVIOUS PLAY. THERE IS 5 SECONDS REMAINING IN THE GAME WHEN THE BALL WAS RECOVERED BY WASHINGTON. THERE'S 5 SECONDS LEFT. &gt;&gt; Kenny: SO 5 SECONDS ON THE CLOCK. YOU TALKED ABOUT IT IN THE OPEN, DARRELL. JAY GRUDEN USED THE CODE RED ON MONDAY. A LOSS TODAY WOULD HAVE JUST KILLED THEIR CHANCES HEADING INTO THE BYE BUT INSTEAD 1,022 GAMES IN FRANCHISE HISTORY. THEY WILL NOW TIE AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT THE EAGLES AND GIANTS FOR THE MOST WINS IN THE DIVISION. &gt;&gt; Daryl: A DEVASTATING LOSS IF THEY HAD GONE ON TO 25 WITH THE BYE. A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS THERE WITH NEW ENGLAND COMING OUT OF THE BYE. NOW TAKE THAT THE OTHER DIRECTION, YOU JUST HAD THE LARGEST COMEBACK VICTORY IN FRANCHISE TRY. YOU'RE GOING INTO THE BYE. THE THIRD QUARTER, WE DON'T NEED TO TALK ABOUT THAT ANYMORE. HOPEFULLY UP GET SOME GUYS BACK HEALTHY. YOU NOW GO TO NEW ENGLAND WITH AN",

  "transcript": "well lucky number seven that will be the Patriots seven or no 32 teams in the Super Bowl Arabs started seven or now they've all made the postseason 15 of those teams made it to the Super Bowl but watch this 9 of 15 won the Super Bowl now today Patriots trying to go to 8 and oh and you see still four teams undefeated Bengals went to eat know on Thursday so the Patriots time to join them meanwhile for Washington they're getting some help with a big addition today let's go down the field with Pam Oliver while running had since been game perfectly helmet head books James big is concerned is not so much about the injury but if his team is most dynamic play in shape absolutely if Jackson gets gassed and is not able to do what they brought him here to and that is to go deep Jackson told us his perspective his stamina level is okay but he's not sure he will hi Pam thanks and John it's it's an aspect that Jake burns offense they've they've laughed they have a lot of weapons but they haven't had the huge play well it's been a lot of possessions spread the ball around you need that explosiveness in your often that's DeSean Jackson we asked him the other day about providing that he said that's what I do and that is what he does here we go from Foxborough and goal is going to take it on and he runs into a wall just across the 15 yard line Redskins won the toss and they deferred and so that gives Tom Brady a chance to take the field he's been he's been pedestrian at home John just 108 and 17 in his career it's unbelievable if he's done at Foxborough he's got prolific numbers but the biggest thing you say about Tom Brady is he wins in it the parts change around him but he's the guy that stirs the drank and he does it so well and so first intend from their own 16 that's been Caspian motion skirting outs and he's got a big gain of 8 on first down some question whether Lewis would play today is that feeling with a little bit of an abdomen injury but he's in there and picks up a nice gain on first down the khole at 9 there's LeGarrette Blount who will get plenty of time in that backfield to this Redskins one defense has been gashed the last three games they'd allowed 196 yards on the ground per run it again first down spinning for Lois and another good one as he's out to the 33 for these Patriots undefeated for the second time at this point seven and Oh in their history and yeah at home their tremendous 48 and for since Oh 9 that's the year after Brady hurt his ACL Brady as John mentioned and it made me better than ever and that no Revis no proud of the two best quarterbacks left neck high the defense is playing great more explain as we go first down waiting near side is January the backup tight end who makes the catch on first down so the Patriots on the move early and it's astounding when you talk about Tom Brady being better than ever Zeke 38 years old 16th year in the league but you watch him and as a player you always think that's when you should be able to play your best football because that's when your mind is is it has all that information stored up but your body typically lets you down what's a phenomenal about him he's managed to learn how to work his body and he's getting rid of the ball quicker than ever more efficient than ever before little draw Lewis nice shimmyshake Ethel Louis off to a flying start he's going to pick up eight more yards than another first down well if there's a weakness on this Redskins defense it's the ability to stop the run especially of late and Bill Belichick and Josh McDaniels the offensive coordinator that's what they do they try to go at weaknesses they attack people and this is a team who came in throwing the football out but if you're week against the run they're gonna run it and they're doing that well early today Brandon LaFell the first touch of the game gets a couple of good blocks another first down he is gonna get all the way down to the 42 when he picks up 12 more yards it's just a welloiled machine LaFell was out early in the year came back a couple of weeks ago just provides one more weapon for Tom Brady he's also a guy that can get down the field as well as catch the underneath routes like that screen and so the Patriots with a goodlooking Drive here already the six play of this opening drive the offense has been tremendous first in the league in scoring at 35 points per game fake two blunts time for brady going up top hey old man kicked in incomplete he had coverage there by will Blackman getting the start today for DeAngelo Hall who remains out well the separation was there for Julian Edelman remember this is guy who does a lot of underneath stuff so when he goes goes deep it does surprise the defense but will Blackman does a really nice job of attacking the football playing through Edelman's arms nice play by Blackman they got filling in for DeAngelo Hall who's been injured Washington secondary has just not been healthy the entire year today continues that trend Rob Gronkowski split out Blake Lockett 1 they'll get it off and they hit sprung and he makes the catch for being shoved out of bounds around the 33 it's gonna be shy the first down John injuries we told you about them there are some key enactus for today for both teams Washington certainly with their secondary has been an issue so Hall who is there big guy back that remains out with a tow Cory Lichtenstein their center still out Jamie Collins and sheered couple big pass rushers out for New England Marcus cannon the left tackle is out today babe it's just awesome on third down this is a thirty two empty set fourman rush brady going deep again has a man dropped OD on lowest had and just couldn't hold in it was a touchdown tom brady talked to us the other day he talked to us you see the sun there that Dion Lewis was dealing with but Tom Brady talked about how critical Dion Lewis has been to their success you see the double move the slant and go it's right in his arms and Dion Lewis doesn't come up but Bill Belichick doesn't hesitate he keeps his offense out there to go for it they've gone for it six times or three of six on fourth down this year this is a fourth and two Lee Brady over the middle complete it's an omen it's a first down well Brady and Edelman so in tune and really this is just called a choice route he's looking at the leverage of the defense trying to find that soft spot he's going to sit there Brady hit some look at that accuracy right to the outside away from the linebackers that's what chemistry and playing together for a long time gives you so on the opening drive the Patriots this is their tenth play they convert a fourth down Edelman's 53rd catch which leads vers team from the 28th the run it's of blunt cuts up the middle man inside the 35 or make that the 25 to the 24 it's a gain of four Kevin you know we led with the you know we led this game you see them having scored in 27 straight corners but talking about how much this Patriots team throws the football kind of nontraditional usually you throw that much only when you're a bad team they've thrown it but they do run it well when they do run it and that's something they're gonna try to take advantage of today the early indication is anything they go three tight ends when they give it to Blount and he's hit behind the line but still goes forward and manages to get a yard out of that nice play by Ricky jeanfrancois was there first let's see the Patriots in that kind of formation much and you're right hey go Bella check said during the week I don't believe in a balanced offense see he just wants an offense that's gonna win he like it makes disagreement between Tom Brady and Bill Belichick but when we told Tyler about that he said I love balance the quarterbacks best friend third and five as the captain absorbs a wicked hint Keenan Robinson on the hits and we get a penalty personal foul unnecessary roughness defense number 30 Tyshawn Jarrett's the rookie and it's what you love about julian edelman this is a guy who's willing to go across the middle into the fire he knows he's going to get hit right here he does get hit it's kenan robinson who hits him they called the foul the personal foul on the wrong Clarets Kenan Robinson but Julian Edelman so often we saw it in the Super Bowl taking hits across the middle it's a valuable valuable asset they have in Julian Edelman first and goal from the 8 for the Patriots Brady gets rid of it quickly Edelman makes a move lensing touchdown New England Kevin I would say as you see julian edelman reached the ball across the goal line other than the Dion Lewis dropped just a flawless execution on that drive by the Patriots it's something you see time and time again see the elbow down but it's where that ball is when the elbow goes down it looks like it's across that goal line yeah I think that ball is there before that elbow goes down they're looking at it as they do on every score I think you know John I think you see that for the Patriots and most touchdowns in the league this is what they they are this year they are methodical the longest play on that drive was 13 yards but they just keep coming at you and Grady is so precise it's pretty hard to defend and so Gus Kowski the extra point he has been perfect on everything this year and that is good and so the Patriots of 13 play opening drive hitting Edelman for the touchdown it's 7 nothing they're up Julian Edelman catching that touchdown also caught a fourth down on the drive also got drilled on the drive which was open and a penalty man he is tough and the Patriots their fourth opening drive touchdown of the year already a careerhigh for Edelman looking onside kick to start this one in choice Patriots say they have it and they do well it's called the surprise on sidekick no one was surprised from Washington the man right there has it in his grasp I think it's Ryan Grant the wide receiver but just can't bring it in the Patriots a nontraditional Bill Belichick has always believed in it he told us the other day it goes back to when his dad was on the Navy staff their head coach Wayne Arden was always nontraditional they had to be at Navy that's stuck with him they don't they're unconventional they always happen they don't care what anyone else thinks and it proves successful yet again for the Patriots Jay Gruden the head coach the launch didn't saying you've got to be kidding Jonathan Freeney with the recovery and so after a great opening drive they get it back and no one a reverse light on Amendola makes it cut across nice run and the Patriots just off and firing here after their seven or no start and a game last Thursday ten days to prepare for this Washington team first recovered onside in awhile it's their first onside try all year now you see the tempo now Tom Brady likes to wear on the opponents it's just snap after snap of precision now they're gonna pound a little lunch to the outside and man he had even more room to on if it wasn't for will Blackmon we have a penalty on the play to that one maybe coming back on New England there's no foul for offensive bowling now believe it was Danny Amendola that they were calling for that I don't know what happened in that conversation here's Danny Amendola he's cracking on jkwon Jarrett he had ahold of them let him go and somehow and that that conference they decided to let that go alright so first intend for New England three the sixteenth play of the first quarter Washington none thanks to the onside kick di Lewis in the game a battle pitcher two on this side Washington hasn't played well he was trying to escape but here comes Terry him they played that well Preston Smith the rookie was the guy that really blew up that play he did a tremendous job you just do your job put a little Patriots on him you got to contain this that's a tough play it's a misdirection flip 90 Americas play whatever you want to call it but Preston Smith the rookie was on it doing his job as Bill Belichick the Patriots coach so often preaches while Kerrigan just had hand surgery two weeks ago broken hand screws inserted took the body on he's playing today second and long they faked the reverse set up the screen here's Lewis look at the speedy Louis inside the 44 he's up and in shy of the first down by Golson a makeable third down because of that play they pick up 15 you know it's incredible Kevin they find a guy like Dion Lewis again one man's trash is another's treasure he's been kind of a journeyman player a guy who's shown some glimpses but never really put it together they get ready Shane Vereen he goes free agent to the New York Giants this is a critical thing kevin faulk chambering he comes in he steps up Tom Brady said we didn't know until early in the year that we had they've got it in Diaw hoes on third down over the has attached and the ball comes loose and I believe it's recovered by Blackmon it is Washington recovery Blackmun forced it he recovered it and a turnover for this Washington D that's a big play that Patriots are humming Blackmon gets after that ball then has the sense to get down on the big play for the Redskins Bombo well there you see Edelman who had a great start but washing a defense now 10 to his last five games the defense is getting the ball and they need it because it was a runaway train to start this game so here's the first time with the ball 638 to go in the fourth and plesance gives it right a ball that Garcon could have cost and New England one play their ball ready to go and this will go down in the books as an interception for Kirk Cousins but he has nothing to do with this he puts a dime on Pierre Garcon Garcon goes right through his hands look and Ryan opportunistic right there that's what you can't do when you come to Gillette and play the Patriots they thrive on the turnovers at home so all the momentum has gone Garcon with the drop logan Ryan his fourth interception of the year that leads this team we told you earlier we showed you that that thing about browner and Revis no problem because guys like he and Malcom Butler have stepped up and now 7 nothing their lead and New England football first and 10 on the Washington 28 fake the Ron Rainey looking far side Chandler and he had nothing there good coverage by Trent Murphy you know Kevin it's fascinating as we get back to the Patriots offense to watch Rob Gronkowski they don't have a Randy Moss anymore to stretch the field and you talked about how they're methodical but they're explosive players Rob Gronkowski and they move him all over the first series 8 different lineups for Rob Gronkowski they constantly are moving them he's in line he's out at receiver he's left he's right now he's right here at the because for the New England Patriots and now it goes in motion on second down Brady they look for Amendola makes the test when he's hit immediately hi Sean Jarrett the rookie at a Virginia Tech who's played safeties played corner and he brings up a third down after a three yard game patrons an astonishing 47% on first down this year that's number one Emily on Kowski now down split out as a wide receiver third and seven blitz picked up beautifully over the middle of completion Anna first down it's anand ola one thing that you see already today Tom Brady does not care he has goto guys yes he loves throwing her off Gronkowski but he throws to the open man he throws where coverage dictates you see him go through his progression throw it where only Amendola can catch it and that's the patrons having great call by you and great catch by you watch Dion Lewis right here the Patriots love tough players he's a small guy but he's got courage he just stones Keenan Robinson Pass protecting as well as a pass option and a receiving game he gives up 50 pounds dream job here's Brandon LaFell makes the catch good stiff arm and he gains it down to the 74 Chris Culliver kind of shoves him out of bounds of seven yard game another thing that you see and you see on tape and Tom Brady's doing it better how quickly he gets rid of the ball he's leading the league in terms of time the balls in his hands that ball is out he makes quick decisions he processes information quickly and then a quick quick release there's a quick handoff once tries to get around right side and it's close to a first down depending on where they mark it so here we are in the first quarter still Washington has run one play New England has run 22 six different receivers have caught the ball and you know it coming in I like I said in the open a Redskins player down on the field said we got to play a nearperfect game you can't give him opportunities third and one they go three tight ends they go touchdown blunt but hang on there's a penalty if it stands it's a touchdown for LeGarrette Blount let's see that's on Washington 12 men on the field defense 12 men on the field hi and so they take advantage of the Logan Ryan interception and punch at home you can see Trenton Robinson up there running off it doesn't matter McGarrett blood steam rolls into the end zone for the Patriots hard to think of a worse start for Washington I mean they come off the by off the biggest comeback in the history of their Dam 24 to nothing to Tampa Bay in the first half their last game and they came back to win that game this isn't this is a much harder task at hand this Kowski cooks in home defense got it done Garcon with the drop Logan Ryan is fourth pick and then braiding the boys do the rest in its 14 nothing New England here in Foxborough Patriots 14 they're up on Washington 14s if Tom Brady 38 years old he stood at the same fire some fun huh done he loves it he said that's part of it the leadership can it still be there at 38 can you still relate to your teammates and he certainly does this Thompson decided to take it out here and so 426 left in the first quarter new england's run 24 plays Washington won and eight Kirk Cousins ever get a chance to really say hello not your fault but he's coming off the best game of his career he's got to feel like a little kid you know that old game monkey in the middle where they keep the ball away from he's got it one time he threw a nice pass went through gar son's hands but he is coming off a very nice game first Tampa and Kevin the one thing it is a different task against the Patriots but when you have a comefrombehind win like that it makes you believe that you're always in football games we're gonna give it to Alfred Morris who gets the carry Morris gonna pick up about five game break time let's check in with Mike Hill Rams and Vikings battle the two best well two little better running backs in the lead Todd Gurley and agent Peterson well the veteran tell the rookie I still got skills six yards get some six in the bike hands on top 10 nothing in the first Kevin John back knew we had the Vikings a month ago on that great game in Denver they are Mike Simmons done a tremendous job with that team defensively very tough to do you see DeSean Jackson number 11 playing in his first game since the first quarter a weak one cousins pressure from Incubus has a manual dereck carrier oh my what's going on today you're seeing typically surehanded guys Dion Lewis Derek carrier for both sides now the Sun is tough but those are excuses when you're playing at the NFL level you've got to deal with it Kirk Cousins has to be sitting early what do I have to do I throw one on to our son it's intercepted I put a big play in carriers hands and he drops it Matt Jones in the game of running back then a third and six buzzes bangs in trucks again what's going on with Washington but they've got three drops the first four plays they run you got to catch the football you got to be on point to have a chance against the Patriots he'd be short of the line to gain one thing you can't see Kirk Cousins can deliver the football on the dime he's got a strong arm his guys are failing him by dropping all these ket passes right now and so now it'll be Edelman to return off the Tres way punt it's not a good kick they'll let it bounce pick it up at the 33 and good coverage by Washington to get down there and make the stop Geron Johnson Darrell young there Tom Brady up 14 getting the ball again here in New England one of the incredible things about this New England offensive run this year has been their offensive line has been so banged up you see number 66 their left guard Brian Stewart he's restarting Center last year back for the first time this year today and this is a second snap of the game but a guard not at center here's Deon Louis behind that could have been a long game Ricky jeanfrancois but John when a plane basically was six linemen they've got to go their best linemen on IR and somehow they're still putting up 36 a game well that's somehow and I hate to be disrespectful to these guys because they've done a very nice job but when your quarterback averages 2.1 seconds before he releases the ball the defense doesn't have a chance to get there Tom Brady is processing information getting rid of the ball so quick I feel like you could go group grab five guys in Boston and put him out there and and they they could protect Tom Brady no I know what you mean I mean you saw Sebastian former he's at left tackle he's normally the right tackle the radio throw at Edison overthrown so just how quick is Tom Brady well you just see snap to release there you go two point oh five seconds the ball is out 2.38 that's a long time for Tom for baby as the ball gets downfield but the numbers say it fastest in the NFL in terms of getting rid of the football no one's doing it better right now here though a third and long their first 30 long in the game time lot of it this time Brady gets hit let's it fly to the fellows comes back makes the catch and he's inside the 20 Chris Culliver just got lost well it never fails Kevin we showed the quick release and he holds it for four seconds and it grows it Township oh you see Tom Brady letting it uncover holding the football and downfield just Chuck's it to Brandon LaFell and as you said Tolliver just got lost in the shuffle a 48 yard gain Brandon LaFell converting a third name so first and ten from the 18th ben kasica goes in motion is blunts on that right side it's down inside the 16 but just to finish the thought so Vollmer now at left tackle you know they've got sold her out for the year david andrews is rookie center number 60 but they like what he's done after a rough start i don't know how many of the teams that could do that no you can and i come back to that comment i said earlier you can't just grab people and play them there they're doing a nice job there at Justin Tom Brady makes it a lot easier on him though with how efficient he is getting rid of the football it all works together that's the bottom line secondary Louis the fake to him Rainey white pants incomplete over the middle he was looking for Chandler there play a nice coverage by kaishan Jerry Scott Chandler is a guy that Tom Brady is really taken to as another option in this offense a tight end who they listed 6 7 he looks like he's 68 to me standing next to him at practice Tom Brady on a dime just out of the outstretched fingers of Chandler but they've got great chemistry for two guys that are playing together for the first time and so it'll be another third down half Hey coming intercepted it is picked off Keaney Robinson gets a block and take endeavour by time Rainie Rainie man saved the touchdown but Robinson with a huge play Keenen Robinson understanding what we just showed you how quickly the balls out he runs right underneath the intended receiver julian edelman just reading the eyes tom brady apparently doesn't see him but the hustle played by tom brady getting back sacrificing his body and somehow get Makena robinson down so now it golden opportunity for washington to get back in the game it's Alfred Morris running left and he's gonna pick up a couple how about this New England hadn't turned the ball over at home none now they've got to in this game still at 14 though as Washington had three drops in the early going the final minute of this first corner the clearly their best chance here as to Sean Jackson and motionless speedster the big play man fake the lon tie thousand times Jackson at the last second it was Justin Coleman because Jackson was open but Coleman knocked it down the play had a really nice design you're gonna see DeSean Jackson enter your picture coming behind the linebackers but the length of a free knee makes him throw it over free knee and Coleman really doing a nice job reading the eyes of Kirk Cousins and deflecting the ball before it got to test rookie from Tennessee on third down Washington much better this year than last last year the 30th in the this year temporally this 1/3 Nate they've come the Patriots on the Blitz picked up cousins over the middle he's got a completion and a catch and it should be enough for a first down it's Pierre Garcon making amends for the earlier drop and that is a first down it should also be the end of the first quarter here from New England very nice call by you Kevin great protection up front they brought the Blitz they protected at gape cousins times and he delivered a strike so it's then also a Mullen but Washington trying to get back in this game for teens at Patriots after one not often you say well Kurt cousins is one of five but he looks good today but he does they've dropped three balls on him and he's got washington with a first and ten at the new england 35 as we start the second quarter 14 nothing packs matt jones and running back they'll give it to and the rookie gets maybe a yard for Chandler Jones makes a stop well this is the deal here I mean this is the first pass he threw right in the hands of Garcon he dropped it intercepted this would have been a gain of about 50 if carrier holds on to that and then this would have been short of the first down but Jordan Reed is very shorthanded so it's kind of weird starting yeah when you're playing the defending Super Bowl champions in their home that can't happen they hit to beat them you got to be near flawless the pistol formation here and again after all here's Jackson his first catch and he's going to get down to about the 32 a short game but I'm sure just trying to get him involved it's his first catch of the year but right there you love what you see that man right there Chandler Jones he leads the NFL in sacks right there he saw the screen he was Russian quick Kirk Cousins turnaround made that tackle that's great hustle from the NFL sack later Chandler Jones third down and seven what to say about Chandler Jones they just extended that lead nine and a half now for Chandler Jones and he talked about coaching that play they flipped him they wanted the matchup against Moses they put Chandler Jones up top and it's not a contest that's just out of the blocks too quick for Moses the crowd noise effects it and that's what Chandler Jones has done all year he's been relentless offenses on the field on a 4th and 11 and this is to home for two what do you think you think they're really gonna go there I have no idea surprise me you know it's uh it's you got to turn over switch they net which never happens here you got three drops Washington has to do a better job to stay in this game yeah they really do and look this situation right here the fourth down I remember playing games against great offenses back in Tampa Tony Dungy say we're never punt punt team don't even think about it cuz to beat a great team but this is certainly risky this is fourth and 11 against the New England Patriots tough tough decision Jake Bruton being bold yeah and it looks like Kirk Cousins is back out so they're gonna go on this fourth and 11 down 14 early second quarter what a call here in this game at this point like they're bringing pressure blitz picked up cousins lets it go drops by Garcon so was the football but Garcon couldn't make a play and it's a play Garcon has to make again he's a strong catcher of the football that's just one on one Logan Ryan making the play we come back to Foxborough 14 to nothing picnics leave this one in there football after Washington went on fourth and 11 McGarrett one TRUCKING to the right side for Keenan Robinson Oxendine you know it was a lot of things that last call right I mean just to call to go for it with a kicker who's got a pretty big leg even though he's young but the end but Garcon another play that Washington left on the table yeah I'm all for being aggressive I don't like that call though you've got a kicker who's made it from 54 this year that's what it would have been all that being said Garcon has to catch that football they're just leaving it out on the table and against too good of a team here once finding some holes and this Patriot team that usually throws a lot more than runs is like in the ground game today well when you've got too tight in who's 305 pounds and if they're off it's a tackle this is called a wham play he's gonna wham ceedric Goulston you see the man on man up above him that's tremendous blocking and so this offensive line we've talked about been much maligned in different parts but they're always in sync they played together great execution right there 13 rushes 58 yards for this Patriot grant attack running again this ticking hits but still he's gonna get a nice game here he's gonna pick up six but will Blackmon made the stop he's one of those guys LeGarrette Blount it's 250 pounds so you better stop I'm at the line of scrimmage cuz he gets a head of steam he's carrying a pile with them and right now they're on point with their blocking and these Washington defenders are just hanging on as they take a ride on LeGarrette Blount I'll throw it here blitz Brady Henderson throws it's incomplete so blitz gets home we've got a game break checking in with Curt Menefee I like New England Carolina playing at home unbeaten and with the lead Cam Newton one yard dive against Green Bay there were up 10 7 order on the second quarter hey welcome back the football Kevin Burkhardt well thanks Curt it's good to be back that's for sure hey Carolina doing what they're doing meanwhile the penalty was on Washington John and it gives New England first illegal contact on Keenan Robinson he was covering Rob Gronkowski and Rob Gronkowski see it right there as he does the double move past five yards good call by the back judge if de blancs almost broke that one is inside the 25 down to the 23 we see Rob Gronkowski now in motion he's going to be the block back guy and then you're again you get space david andrews the center with a great job get space for LeClair LeGarrette Blount going down he'll forget about it he is a big man that can move Patriots already with 221 yards of offense there's 10 minutes left in the half as Blount this time doesn't find any running into the left side 10 you know what's fascinating all these aspects of New England we know great they are but on this offense there's not a single firstround draft pick not one that's incredible and it's incredible that their quarterback wasn't one yeah you know how late he went but that that is incredible and Rob Gronkowski's a great story there he's a guy that was injured came out as junior year we'll get into that story more because it's a fascinating one but there's firstround Talent no first rounders though it seemed to find those guys run a got a little bit of tread in his pass but he has had the best success here there is receiving good luck covering him and Josh McDaniels credit to him because he continues to move him all over he's constantly in a different position this time in motion remember last time he cracked back on the wham this time he goes out to the flat so finding him because they move him all over as tough but you better find him because he's the focal point of this offense Rock lined up to your left now topping the screen able to swim out wide late clock and Warren Thurston goal so incomplete flag flies as well illegal formation offense number 76 was in the backfield fiveyard penalty first down it's best and Walton where you see him you see how far back he is he has to break kind of that buttocks line of the left guard and the center and Sebastian Vollmer trying to get a the advantage and that's been a point of emphasis this year calling that on the tackles we've seen that a lot so they call it back to 12 what remains in the game at tailback give it to him stutter step and Washington plated well hurry to clean it up but we'll Compton was there first Joe berry the defensive coordinator for these Washington team is a really good coach I've been around him in his career in the Tampa days he's bringing a new philosophy in here that's very much predicated on everyone being in their spot a one gap defense and they're struggling to pick it up and then I'll say that get handcuffed because the back end has been so injured shagging and gold and Brent County matched up against black metal quarterback claw to me the screen to get a throw with Rome but coverage although sometimes it doesn't seem to matter when you throw it to Gronk no it's fascinating watching people play him though right there you see will black men a corner we saw a safety on him prior you see linebackers on them whatever you try it's a mismatch because he's 6 6 265 pounds and can flatout run you say about Brady as you see he's been outstanding in the red zone obviously with that size he said ray makes it fun to keep finding new ways to get open and complete a pass no matter where the defender is yeah we've seen that third and goal they get a little screen Louis get some room makes people and he's finally brought down man he made that exciting Washington does their job and they will hold to a field goal attempt it's a really nice job on the sudden change for this Washington Redskins defense holding down in the red zone see Gus Kowski he replaces a Hall of Famer in Adam Vinatieri and dare I say he might be better you look at the numbers obviously not the clutch kicks that been a tear he has had but this guy's really really good there's a 21yard field goal for him Ryan Allen with the hold kick is up and good 27 consecutive field goals for Gus Kowski 17 zip Patriots last we saw Washington couple weeks ago for thereby they were down 24 to nothing kind of about this moment to Tampa Bay this obviously a more precarious situation down 17 nothing here at New England they'll get the ball back after a kiss Kowski 21 yard field goal they will start on their own xx we will see this underrated Patriots defense back on the field Pat 7a know to start none be pretty good so far Washington football trailing 17 nothing they're out gained so far 246 214 they've had chances in this game that's the thing Morris gets the carry for a gain of three I mean they've had four drops they've had two tours they forced him to England who knows maybe that's a touchdown return of great who doesn't make that tackle so they've had chances but they're down 17 and now they've got to find something offensively but John you said you you know looking at this team look at the film you you actually like what they have offensively Washington's getting better they really are I like what Kirk Cousins is doing I'd see him you know he just became the starter and this is finally his team and he's starting to show it he can throw the football very well he's got some things he needs to work on the turnovers have always been his Bugaboo but he's playing much better to make the catch that's going to be ruled incomplete another one right in the hands but that is not caught by carrier there's a power charlie bump and run coverage that's what the Patriots do these days he's a guy that struggled frankly early in his career playing away from the line of scrimmage they changed the defense in many ways to suit his skills he plays best near the line of scrimmage so they play a lot of loaded boxes and he's playing at a high level right now Dario's defense that wasn't a truck as a good play as John pointed out third down and seven residence time over the middle complete and that is a first down so Garcon has dropped to today makes the catch and that will move the chains much needed for Washington you go back to that was it a drop was it a good play but I do know this those are the type of plays you have to make if you want to beat a champion and right now the Redskins are falling short of that I think defensively you look at them and they're short talent right now they've got another year to get there offensively I like a lot of what's happening for the Redskins Cousins has time they're going to set it up to Jones onehanded catch from the rookie and he's gonna pick up 11 and a first down this is the guy that Washington thinks going to be their lead back for years to come well he's 230 pounds six feet one you can see he can catch it we saw early in the year a very effective runner that could run inside and outside he's got everything you want he's also a very good pass blocker so they're comfortable leaving a minute in passing situations so a couple of first downs for Washington here as they move the chains here's Jones good speed and Matt Jones has another first down he's got a 10 yard game for Hightower got a hold of him to three straight first downs something finally for this offense they go to a little zone read and it's something they'll do with Kirk Cousins he was drafted the same year as Robert Griffin the third and so it was kinda in the offense that kept it around he scored a touchdown last week first half of the key to beauty will be played by Jones again pucks back with taken down from behind by Brown after a short gain you know you think about cousins to John when you talk about him and what you like about him today is his 17th career start in your head he's been around a long time but he really just completed his rookie year in some ways man talking to Jay Gruden down on the field before the game part of it is just he's starting to but to be a quarterback this has to be your team you see that with Tom Brady he wants more assertion this is my team come follow me and he's starting to get that second down it's coming he still has time man Cousins has another completion this is Jameson Crowder the goodlooking rookie at a Duke Crowder plays beyond his years he's a rookie but he plays like a fifth sixyear player he knows where to be when to be there and then he catches the ball very very well thirty two catches coming in he turned into this team's lead slot receiver and the first good drive of the day put up by Washington here Oh 16 starts for cousins onethirty here is matt jones slides his way down to about the 27 to gain of three it's interesting Kevin and talking to Matt Patricia the defensive coordinator for the New England Patriots this was always a team if you watch the Patriots split safeties mean two safeties back away from the line of scrimmage now you watch some Patrick Chung is always up near the line of scrimmage loaded boxes he says it's because a lot of footballs being played in the middle of the field right now so it makes sense to put more people there that's what they're doing and they're doing it at a high level run it again Jones again he's getting good yards he's gonna be a yard shy of the first down he's gonna pick up six and a third down and one so with that being said wouldn't it be easier that's growing to the outside of the field it puts a lot on your corners and you thought when they didn't have Revis anymore they didn't have browner they would go away but now they're saying Malcolm Butler we expect you to cover I do think that's a weakness I think they have two very good corners and Malcolm Butler and Logan Ryan Coleman's coming along but I think that's a weakness where you can attack the Patriots third down and one Joan softly had forceful one the legs kept churning and he's got a gain of two in a first down as a goodlooking drive for Washington and they needed it behind the running of Matt Jones it's a run game that's been stymied here of late very good early in the year it hasn't been working what they have an offensive line coach and Bill Callahan who knows how to run the football Dallas led the league in rushing last year he's here they're doing it a lot better they're trying to get back that because they need that for their offense Chris Thompson their third running back lines up top of your screen as a receiver on first down cousins over the middle he's got the herb is a defender and is down to about the 13 yard line he picks up six that he jumped right over Justin Coleman he's another of these tight ends that we see in the league that are really tough covers because he is plays like a wide receiver frankly you see the athleticism so Reed has the Redskins in good position down 17 but in good position twominute warning first set 17 nothing patrons but this has been really the only drive of the day for Washington the 11th play make that the 12th play of this Drive two minutes to go in the half from the 13 it's Matt Jones who's run well on this Drive and it'll be close to a first down should have it Washington 14 yards total this first half got 72 on this drive so it's turned around here for them and a first and goal it is Kevin I like the poise by Kirk cousin with a full poise that he's demonstrated his teammates have let him down early today and it would have been easy for a younger quarterback to kind of fall to pieces instead he's hung right in there and playing a nice game lynnie tell us about being down against Tampa say the only way to build my is to do it well said John and Miss Jones gets by one time when he's a troublemaker bitch all over and that's a huge loss branch was the guy that really messed up that way well you see branch right there he's gonna penetrate and then watch they're setting the edge there's destroying the edge he just destroyed the edge did rob Nicky bitch and a guy that really was waived by the New Orleans Saints found his way here in the kicking game now ass it's an integral part of their defenses Rob Nicholas second and goal sundae's helmet flew off cousins stops has to throw it a little high for the Sean Jackson John's a little rebus the center I think got his helmet knocked off on that play he's down on one knee on the ground you see he's all bloodied up no penalty on that see the center right there in the middle helmet off it's ugly in there the one thing watch Dante Hightower he's a big 250 pound linebacker that's Chris Thompson a third down back and that's something Kevin when we talked to him he said he worked on this offseason he wanted to become a better man demand defender he wanted become a better pass rusher he's done both this guy Dante Hightower and Jamie Collins playing the linebacker position as well as anybody in this league yeah that one to Collins again out today la rebus is in a lot of pain and I think it was his own man that knocked a helmet off here there it is yeah it was Brandon sheriff the rookie and outlaw Reba's still down the center 26 seconds to go in the half washington needing a touchdown here down 17 third and goal 13 and a new centre is in Spencer long from left guard to centre all right Quan Joe comes in and left guard after the larita's look with no belly check in that Patricia do you have a new center let's put everybody in here and right in his face let's they back off cousins coming near side Roberts Texas but he's well shortened he needed a touchdown here the field goal unit yet Washington and has one timeout left looks like they will use it nice job by the interior of this offensive line at the double a gap look that we're seeing all through the league you better be strong in the interior and the Redskins hold up despite the injury to larita's the timeout was called by New England and it looks like New England excuse me looks like Washington will try for a field goal here so a good drive by cousins and if you look at what Cousins and Brady have done it's a little misleading Cousins is at four drops one of them could have been for 50 yards Brady's been his usual great self just his second interception of the year though today and I again Kevin you just mentioned it hard to say it with those numbers but her cousins has played well he really has here's Dustin Hopkins picked him up early in the season after they released high for bath three yard field goal try to get Washington on the board snap a little low nice job holding my tress way and it's up and good so it's seventeen three New England thirteen seconds to go in the first half It was as if New England early was planned that Dean Smith four corners keeping keep away from the Washington Redskin that's been Washington just did 16 play 75yard Drive took seven minutes and 43 seconds but held to a field goal but at least they get on the board with 13 seconds to go on the half this one will take a knee halftime coming up for a preview we check in with Curt Menefee Bart we've got the best protected halftime show in the history servicemen and women from the US Army Reserve will join us with Veterans Day just a few days away we've also got highlights from the early games and you know it's always fun whenever Terry Steelers taking on how is great Raider send it for the first time in a long time thanks to all of you I feel completely safe thank you back to you that's great thanks guys so New England takes a knee and they will be content to go into the half with a 17 to 3 lead Patriots their usual dominating self on offense remember Washington get the ball after the half all right lot going on including the big Carolina Green Bay game which to Kurt and the guys days excitement is brought to you by Nissan here at Foxborough where the Patriots have been great at home trade all year Alvin got him on the board first and then mistakes by Washington as the Patriots capitalizing they got the 1 game gun with grunts and they jumped out to a 17 nothing lead and that was today's excited brought to you by Nissan it so it's 17 to 3 as we get set for this third quarter Tom Brady gearing up for this second half hi good to see you guys John Lynch and I'm Kevin Burkhardt you know Washington did a lot of good things offensively because we've only got three points to show for it yeah missed opportunities we talked about it the whole first half against this team you can't miss on that onside kick when they do the surprised their guy was there he dropped it they dropped numerous passes you can't do it so you put yourself in a hole the Redskins do have the history just two weeks ago of coming back against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers that's a different deal than the New England Patriots but they'll come out with a frightening fighting spirit believing that they can then you get the ball they won the toss to start and deferred so the chance to get back in it is right here against these seven no Patriots this kospi little shorter kick Roberts chuckles picks it up and now the Redskins backed up in the wrong territory let's go down to the sidelines say a little Pam Oliver and their Kevin ball I asked the head coach of the Washington Redskins of course I stayed Gruden if he feels like that comeback in recent memory from Tampa if that might be helpful for them today he said it might but he said the main thing for them is to just relax he felt they came out with some nerves and they just need to settle down Bill Belichick told me that we can't worry about what they've done in recent memory we've got to do our thing clean up some mistakes captain Sebastian Palmer he is out with a head injury oh wow so another lineman out thanks family Joshua Revis is back at center for Washington cousins the throw and he's got Jones he drops it my goodness the fifth drop of the game for Washington and all the midden right in their hands Kirk Cousins must be saying what do I have to do this one soft right on the money and that's just concentration by the rookie Matt Jones mentioned the rebus memory he got his helmet knocked off was bloody on his face and he's back as we started the second half Spence along the left bar number 61 second and ten years Allen branch not much third long coming up the Patriots always have such versatility on the outside with Nick of itch and Chandler Jones and on the inside with Jamie Collins who's not out there today and Dante Hightower but they always like that beef in the middle thick Vince will firkin branches the guy along with Malcolm Brown who provides that on this year's team late substitution trying to get 11 on time for cousins unloads TVs got a man gar\u00e7on has it at midfield cousins delivers another strike and this time it's a big gain of 36 7 we were talking at the half the one thing they've done very well they've protected Kirk Cousins look at Chandler Jones down at the bottom Moses is going to get him he's going to get some help from Sheriff a lot of time for cousins and I told you coming in this kid can throw the football Kirk Cousins he's a natural throw of the football now they're starting to catch it Pierre gar\u00e7on with the nice deep catch to your point John they don't allow to eat sacks come again second best in the NFL Patriots had one sack today fake the stretch play time again and they'll throw it to Jones out of the battlefield and he's gonna get to the 45 gonna pick up five yards Chung was there on the tackle trying to get Jones involved he was integral in that last Drive before the half interesting watching him you know it's kind of the transition almost from Alfred Morris has been a really good player but you can see Jones surging forward now in this Jay Gruden depth chart well when you look at the guy and he's bigger Chuck he's faster check you know in Alfred Morris is a very good football player he does things extremely well but it's hard not to have Matt Jones on the field you know drop that ball or shake it in five yes it again to the outside the tackle as Malcom Butler brought him down before first Oh 32 that's one thing I really like about Malcom Butler he was the Superbowl sensation made the outstanding pick now it's a starting corner but he is not afraid to compete oneonone and pass coverage and also not afraid to tackle against the big guys he gets him down Washington four of seven on third down today third and two give it to George he stumbled and recovered I think it was nigga bitch Patriots football make a bitch falls on it it's Allen branch who penetrated caused a bumble the Redskins continue to be loose with the ball in New England bad formula for success well it's Allen branch right here in the middle nothing kills a run game like penetration he gets in there not only disrupts but also gets the ball out nikka bitch right there to pick it up and so Patriots have the football at 14 Garrett's one slips through everybody I don't know how you let a guy that big get through like that but he did and it's a first down and a gain of 11 just a big massive hole this offensive line doing yeoman's work speaking of offensive line Kevin they tuck him indicated Sebastian Vollmer out now Fleming Gump's to the left tackle position right tackle is now being man by a tight engine Michael Williams is now played a right tackle number 85 is playing right tackle because they're out of offensive linemen they've been so banged up all year I mean it's been the story all the year even when they've been healthy they've rotated anyway but they only had six healthy guys and that was with activating Brian Stewart today who've been out all year on the IR designated to return with a concussion and neck problems and so yeah their third tight end is a 300 pounder Michael Williams mazel play him in right look it's corks out there now at right time later Sarah last year second and eight good block by Stuart Brady in trouble steps up away makes a man miss is that is pretty when this whole Patriots offense you look at that offensive line don't know quite who's there stork it right tackle but look at the protection Tom rain ones not there twos not there I'll slide to the left and I'll deliver it to number three that's beautifully done going through the protection and great job by the offensive line of giving him that time gain of 24 and a first down down to the 18 with Blount the tailback here's the garret Blount stretching right down to the 15 gonna pick up three Chris Baker and will black men on the play hit Kevin that was a three tight end set but he's actually 85 to play and right tackle so not a three tight end set there's Michael Williams there's Gronk and there's Scott Chandler so three tight ends Williams playing tackle and now they take Williams out and stork back at right tackle they're just changing in every play wondering I'm just a mess with everybody go Bella travel Jimmy Garoppolo out a right tackle back on quarterback I mean why not if it all speaks to work on second down quick hitter Amendola left socket to block inside the 10 first a gold New England these screens you're seeing them around everyone's running them but I think a couple of things Tom Brady how quickly he gets the ball and how accurately look at this Danny Amendola coming in motion watch how quickly the balls there that gives him time now to get behind his offensive lineman find quick yard it showed critical the little things that make this offense so effective they go to tight ends for the right sow Blount the tailback they're gonna throw a fade look bad can't make the play Chris Culliver on the coverage see Brady up at the line of scrimmage they're running effectively so they're loading the box he sees that little signal to the hip just outside of the outstretched arms of Brandon LaFell quick snap one breaks a tackle not the next to you got through the arms of pile then Compton was there a couple of others to haul him down third and goal Kevin how do you like to be Brian stork he just comes back in his second year off the designated return IR and he thinks he's playing sinner playing a little guard a we need to it right tackle but that's kind of how they conditioned these guys here in New England starters play special teams you play wherever they ask you and you do it with smile on your face see Burke was a good center watch really good center third and goal they'll run it once get immediately and taken down Stephen Paea was there first and looks like a field goal try coming up I had the free agent who came from the Chicago Bears gonna burst through the line of scrimmage again penetration in that run game well he fumbled on that play John didn't even see that nor did I fall out and Blount got it back so they will try a field goal 21 yard attempt Fergus Kowski already a patriot record 27 consecutive money from dis Kowski it up stay a knee to a 20 to 3 lead Redskins hold the red zone 4 points for doing here in the third I know for those of our crew behind the scenes I say it for them thank you all of our servicemen and women for all that you do for us as Veterans Day approaches says Roberts gonna take this out seven yards deep and he's out across and 20 upon his head Sean Melvin on the tackle so Washington down 17 their football they are saluting the Patriots in New England well one thing about this Washington team they had some big plays last year and this year they've been the worst in the league 25 yards plus they have won today the 36 yarder to Garcon Sean Jessie's first game since you're not one he's only got one catch for two yards so big plays not there and they've certainly had John missed opportunities across the board that hasn't helped absolutely I mean they had missed opportunities at big plays and it started from the first play of the game her cousin fires a strike to Garcon out of his hands carrier can't catch it there's a big play right there Matt Jones opportunities and then finally the fumble on that last drive where they were moving the football so missed opportunities all day long for the Redskins offense to Jones who fumble vision in here on a second down cousins will sign arm Clint and his flocks again that time it's Crowder who's been pretty sure handed this year the sixth drop of the game Kevin watching football for a long time there's certain guys that are just always around the football the football seems to find them and you think he's a little nervous about Rob Nick of it but Nick of itch is a guy who always finds himself around the ball and you can't teach it you can't coach it that's instinct Rob Nick about hazard third down and nine and looks like some movement from Morgan Moses false start offense number 76 fiveyard penalty third down that's the right tackle one thing about this New England defense in you know wash and put together nice job for the half they had one going for the Jones fumble it is impressive twenty nine percent of the drives against them coming into the three and a third best in the league we showed Malcolm Butler right there you talked about the lack of big plays for DeSean this is a team the Patriots who sometimes will blatantly take away the way they're taken away this on Jackson's Malcolm Butler one on one all day long I snap cousin still has time it's Jordan Reed and makes the catch but he almost loses the ball still though gonna be well shy of a first down and so Washington punts is coming up and there's another three announced 10 yards to Reed who also has been really quiet today after a big game against Tampa two weeks ago Kevin what's so impressive this New England defense let's remember they're doing this without perhaps their best player Jamie Collins who's out with an illness a late in the week and he's not there and they're still playing at such a high level Amendola back to receive this one sprinting near side and the punt goes out of there up 22 three here in the third from Foxborough you want to talk about the pass of two different franchises since 2001 the records it's not even close and obviously because so many things have happened how about starting quarterbacks we're doing one they have that three Washington 15 New England head coaches one Washington 6 and then the playoffs while four Super Bowl wins six Super Bowls 21 playoff the Washington Jonathan crapped on the right the team president Robert Kraft of course the owner on the left and there's Bill Belichick that accommodation along with Tom Brady that's been the formula for great success and here is Brady brat Patrol and zinging it to Rob Gronkowski for a first down he's up to the 43 and hang on there's a penalty back of the line this is going to be on to England first out good call by tearing to call it in didn't hear it no it was so quick that I have no idea what it was it looked like a hole in Kolding perhaps but it's going to negate the big game to Gronkowski but going back to that graphic we had the opportunity to sit with Robert Kraft the other day know one of the things he said I believe in continuity you find good people and then stability nothing like stability and they are the essence of it it starts at the top and say what you want about the pager it's a lot of different feelings but they are successful they sure are that was a hold on Brian Stewart by the way that's why I moved New England backs will become nearside and it's incomplete and you know Kevin I don't you know it's not our job to sit here and talk deflategate that whole deal but I do know one thing if you're too if you're Tom Brady and you don't like what happened to you how's the best way you respond by go plan better than you ever have that's exactly what he's doing this year and he's just he's putting on a clinic for this league is that how you play the quarterback incision yeah Robert Kraft's spent a lot of time with him yesterday this team was on the verge of moving and he bought up the property around and finally bought the team spent a lot more money than he thought and honestly that's worked out pretty well here's di Zeus he's across the 30 let's see they say he was down this he's also heard his Dion Lewis a great hustle play by Baker but Dion Lewis he did not get up you see the screen pass he get him in space boy this is a key cog to what they do Dion Lewis because of plays like this in space but you watch at the finish of this play Chris Baker gonna fall on that ankle and Dion Lewis just kind of came limp at the end and that's not good for the New England Patriots as he's just essential to what they do he's been just an incredible story I mean this is a guy John he had a hundred and ninety two career yards from scrimmage before this year his third year in the league with Philly and with Cleveland and didn't work out with philia they love stars on that team and then Cleveland same deal is that a football for a year and the Patriots picked him up you know he's gonna make the team in terms of being a factor and then he was so good after a month they sign up to a twoyear deal now concerned for Louis so Dion Lewis good news is down for a while but then he looked ok walking off which you would think is agus and watch this this is Matt Patricia the defensive coordinator it's all about team here it really is it's it's the true essence that an opportunity to be here for just three weeks at the end of my 16th year and that's what it's all about his team they've challenged the Redskins have whether it's a fumble the ball does go loose it's a matter if that left knee is down on Dion Lewis well why don't we go to the expert Mike Pereira is back in LA Mike what's your call what do you think about this law like horse first start with what did they rule on the field and they ruled that he was down and I think the knee does get to the ground before the ball starts coming loose and one thing I have seen I have to tell you in the last couple of weeks you know the reversal percentage has been up earlier than Lance Washington charged with their first team timeout it does seem to me that they're doing a much more focused job on staying with what was called on the field unless it's totally obvious that the call was incorrect all right Mike good call there so Terry McCauley and those back in New York agree with Mike for errors and meanwhile so Lewis is now Brandon Bolden is in Brandon Bolden goes to the slot as a wide receiver on a third and six for the Patriots Rainie near CyHi lamendola and it's incomplete and so after the delay with the Lewis injury Washington holds when they get the ball back 5:16 in this third quarter set a million opportunities to get back in this game and they're still in this and the defense has steadied themselves early on they couldn't stop the Patriots now they're stopping them it's just the offense with the missed opportunities the first three now this is Jameson Crowder good point coming to the sidelines this Crowder out across the 30 and that's where they will take over all right John big news tonight on Fox the return of Sunday Funday with an allnew night of Smash Hits an electrifying comedy Sunday Funday returns tonight at 7:30 6:30 central and it's right here on Fox you know that Bart Simpson classic dull that's what Jay Gruden has been doing all day as they drop pass after pass from Oh Department's gonna love you getting that wood and that's well done good job yeah over been around for a long time in Fox so first and ten for Kirk Cousins and company trailing 2244 man rush and he's gonna have a connection of Crowder and not much gain of three before he's taken down Jonathan Freeney is in for Jamie Collins and you know on my board and this is not being disrespectful afraid but he's a poor man's Jamie Collins same kind of body long tall fast he's not as good as Jamie Collins but he's a pretty darn good backup when you lose a player of the caliber of Jamie Collins Alfred Morris in the game it back helps pick up a blitz and then miscommunications cousins through the out and Reed ran the up until another third down this a third and seven at Jones back in the game hasn't been in there as much since that fumble couple drives ago let's picked up cousin's house time over the middle short incomplete looking for Garcon are they under through tremendous protection again by the Redskins that's a really nice job of coverage the rush didn't get there but tremendous coverage by Coleman by Logan Ryan all those guys underneath they got two safeties deep this is called twoman two safeties deep you're playing underneath and they do it to perfection so the Patriots go three and out for the first time all game and they get the ball caught in a minute as this punt weight goes down no flag Amendola is gonna let it bounce and it will do so all the way down keeps on going to about me spotting at the 12 52 yard punt no return Tom Brady what a year he is having hate Richard 7 and oh this is 2007 when the patch went undefeated but the first seven games see what they were doing in 27 and two touchdowns interceptions but here coming into today 20 touchdowns one interception passer rating a one 15.8 look at the comparison now actually more passing yards per game this year get a better passer rating back then because he had more touchdowns bent back then that's the bottom line but Brady today 18 of 28 214 yards one touchdown and only a second pick of the year and they're going to run this football who wants trucking through the line he's up nearer first down in blunts sat himself a big game that's gonna put them right around 80 yards with the game on the ground so they have a mini bye week playing on Thursday last week they understand that they're throwing the ball as much as anybody in the league and you know what we better not forget about the run because it's going to serve invaluable later in the year in the playoffs they've come out they've established it much more balanced and they're told it well with a makeshift offensive line and now without Lewis's LeGarrette Blount show out to the outside breaks somebody bring him down while he's out for the 45 Dashon Goldson finally tripped him up with a gain of 21 at a tough 21 for blunts this would LeGarrette Blount brings you see a great block by Danny Amendola the crack block and then missed tackles you got to be able to tackle in this league it's something that Washington has struggled mightily with Watchmen Amendola that's the force player he puts him on the corner now it's the corners job nice job to have to tackle a 250pound running back coming at you will Blackman doesn't do it and he's out the gate it mark Blount down at the 43 officially as you see an injured Washington player so linebacker Keenan Robinson down on one knee on the far side of the field there's blunts 19 for 109 they tend to robinson we've got a game break let's check in with Mike Hill alright guys Vikings and around settied Bridgewater back the pass looking for somebody can't final succession talked his way to do it my stuff goes in for the 6 yard score and then go for 2 and he liked it so much the first time he said it now do it again finds the pylon it's a threepoint game Vikings on top Kevin job at you to similar football teams right John I mean both behind their running back and both physical defenses very physical that's a heck of a game there so a first down for New England Robinson comes off the field Compton on a linebacker run it again once it's working stick with it although that time he's not going to get anything let's go down the sidelines with Pam what happened you know the Patriots take that next man up philosophy to a whole new level now it's running back Dion Lewis he suffered a knee injury on that scary looking play earlier Lewis is out for the rest of the game okay Pam thanks James White's kind of a Lewis clone if you will he's inactive so it's just Bolden and Blount the two running backs that are active for a New England second down Amendola quick hitter tackled immediately by Jarrett Kevin it it's a long held New England Patriot philosophy they always carry four running backs and Bill Belichick thought is you're going to use them all at some point during the year they have different styles Dion Lewis LeGarrette Blount but then they carry four they kind of carry a clone of each and James White is that guy he's not active but you hope that Dion Lewis is okay but if not next guy up and that would be James Wright and that's Brandon Bolden in the game of the back Fuel down at the 38 on a third and 10 three man rush all day the Grady hits Brock fighting his way first down Washington territory he's down to the 45 it's a game of 12 yeah we talked about Tom Brady getting rid of the ball quickly one thing he talked about with us the other day against threeman rush here's an opportunity to extend the play you only have three guys rush and that means that means eight in coverage so sometimes you have to wait for things to come open that's exactly what Brady does stepping up he allows Gronkowski to uncover find the soft spot Tom Brady always finding the next level of force backing up the gut not much you talked about that story about Gronkowski how the Patriots found him they drafted in the second round this guy came out his junior year after a back injury didn't play a whole year in college and Bill Belichick I had a meeting with him and how did he say when he said the Sebastian Rodriguez got a regular traditional job interview it wasn't too good rob was asking where the clubs are a hat and pelvis and you know but what they did they trusted his head coach at Arizona Mike Stoops and Mike Stoops said this is the toughest player we have in practice then you start to watch the tape he was primarily a blocker but he said go back to the year earlier there was a game where he caught the ball they did this morn may run out but it's just they going back to his sophomore year he had a game where they used him as a receiver he caught it really well they brought him in really not knowing loving the body type and all this they thought he was a traditional why just kind of a blocker they had Aaron Hernandez second preseason game he tells Bill O'Brien the offensive coordinator let's send him out on some passes he goes crazy looks like the Gronk and here we go you know the the best tight end in football unequivocally in my mind so moral the story sometimes a bad at job interview can get you job and Pro Bowls and Super Bowls it all working for New England 20 to three leading Washington after three from Foxborough Patriots got off to a great start and then have just maintained since 22 three they lead Washington as we start the fourth quarter New England has a football third and eight for the Washington 43 lady broch first down to the 30 13 years ago and Kowski and keeps the change moving for New England it's all employers don't just go on that first job interview look at the body of work can rob gronkowski he's got an impressive body of work one thing he talked about the other day when we spoke with Rob he loves the challenge they put him everywhere he loves that that's what keeps it fresh for him Bill Belichick loves about him that he'll come to the sidelines talking about his blocking more than his kechi this is the careerhigh 27 carry for the garret blunt over hundreds on the day and he's down to the 26 and Gronkowski talking to his high school basketball career when we were meeting with him here's the replay here he is blocking it's just like having another offensive tackle in there he's such a big man he takes a lot of pride in his blocking and does it very well he said yeah averaged 23 15 I was the layup and dunk guy team I could see it here's blunt right side a big tight ends left and right he's gonna be shy of the first down I'll bring up a third and short game break time let's check back in with Pierre benefit well the Parkers without 27 7 at Carolina at halftime to begin closer to set the second half Randall Cobb 53yard or from Aaron Rodgers book Carolina's come back with a field goal and they leave it in 30 the 14 in the third comes down a fan Wow Kurt so Caroline is trying to go to 8 no the Patriots trying to go to 8 no Denver trying to go and eat no later against Indianapolis bangles are already a no once he's got himself a first down to the 20 you have to applaud this offensive line there's been injured all year long and even before they were injured there's the offensive line coach David help me out with that name Giuliana thank you but even before they were injured they were rotating guys and Bill Belichick said this the other day who says you have to play fine are we gonna do whatever we wanted they want to get everybody experience and now they are because they have to Don Kowski lined up as a fullback net and the runner reverse to element gets around Carrigan zags fly Edelman tripped up just before the 15 feeling all fixed number 87 10yard penalty first down he's Rob Gronkowski now playing fullback yet another spot Ryan Kerrigan I don't know about that little Jersey came out there but I'm with you grok well that hold moves and backs B first and 20 back down to 30 12:23 to go on the game Patriots up 22 threeyear lady slings it out to bogan is behind them and can't make the play this Patriot offense started like a house on fire they got the opening kick they went 13 plays 84 yards Edelman with a touchdown catch and then they do the onside kick you know and they're flying it's 14 to nothing Austin defense done a pretty decent job since they really have it was surgical early and this Washington defense Joe Barry is a good football coach he will get these guys right they need some more personnel Scott McLuhan a new general manager he'll find it they're sent Alex short but when they get that talent they're gonna be all that there's his first touch since week two of the season and he's down to the 18 so a nice run from Boldin's gonna pick up 12 and a third down coming up for the Pats this offensive line has been phenomenal Brian stork just coming back from injury was a sinner last year playing some guard now he's at right tackle the planet tight ends and right tackle but they're running the ball effectively the dominating line of scrimmage third down eight its Amendola in motion and Brady's gonna call a timeout so a timeout for Brady is the Patriots trying to make this 20 20 the three game now trying to add to that welcome inside booth John Lynch I'm Kevin Burkhardt yeah hey if the Patriots don't do it one way they do it another right they run the ball more today and the defense is been underrated all year it's a really good football team right you know I people talk about 2017 2015 team who cares though both really good but I think this team has an edge because of that defense they're a little bit better in their younger on the defensive side of the ball and we keep going back to it but Tom Brady playing as well as he ever has played the one thing they don't have on this team is a Randy Moss a guy that stretches it deep down the field but that explosion comes in the way of Rob Rob Gronkowski the one thing though is without all those claiming you know the playmakers Randy Moss nobody like him right but I think the misconception as well these Patriots don't have a lot of weapons they've got the best tight end the lead they've got the best slot receiver in the league they've got to you know I mean there are weapons here and they get the best quarter but I got the bargain if they got the point guard he makes better third down and eight Rainie welcome touchdown we talked to Bill Belichick about Tom and the way he's playing the first thing he said Kevin was he sees it so very well he always has and what he's talking about he always finds the matchup well there's the linebacker on Bolton Bolton hasn't played but Tom knows what he can do he sees the mismatch he identifies it and then he throws a strike with tremendous accuracy that's Tom Brady in a nutshell right there who are the Patriots here's Bouldin hasn't had a touch of the football since week two and that's his first receiving touchdown for the fourth year Pro 18 yards it goes down Gus Kowski perfect and it's 20 cinnamon at three for these Patriots Tom Brady continuing tool that's looking to go that is one excited Patriot fan he's got the beads on he's looking at his team about to go eight an old best Kowski smokes it out of the end zone and now Washington takes over by the road 20 will smile josh mcdaniels the offensive coordinator Tom Brady why not 27 3 Patriots 11 28 to go in the game back at Foxborough with Pam Oliver and John Lynch on Kevin Burkhardt I entire great crew directed by Artie Kempner produced by pete macheska washington football from her own 20 down 24 cousin stands in fires mr. Shawn Jackson just his second catch and his first game back since the opening quarter a week one has been out since with a hamstring and that's certainly not what we want to see Jackson getting up limping there you know if you just turned on you're thinking man there's a ton of how you thought the game would go but Washington said so many opportunities in this game to get back in it drops and turnovers and mental mistakes and that's one that in and out of the hands of Reed but if you look at this Washington team John barring a miracle comeback as Jackson gets off the field there's still right the mix of this NFC East as and as a division that the vision has been down all year it really has been and what they need to do they just came off a bye week they're getting closer to being healthy they need everyone back you need DeAngelo Hall you need Breeland and that back in that will make them a little bit better on defense I like what's going on offensively the only up three points they got a quarterback he's starting to play well Chris Thompson and the pistol has a first down well I think and we have a link flag far side of the field at the 29 so we'll decipher that at the very least we talked earlier about cousins and this being his team for the first time he's always been holding offense number 76 10yard penalty throw down it's just been that kind of day that son Morgan Moses the right tackle look at the very least tell me if you agree but a Jay Gruden in the second year you could certainly see progress from the moment that he took over this team right here's no doubt about it this was it this this was a team after rg3 had the success it was in a bad place Mike Shanahan had left there wasn't a whole lot of players now you're starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel you starting to see some things and and so if they could stay with it then they could start to have some success again rg3 inactive today he's only been dressed for one game and that's because they had so many injuries they had to dress him he has been a nonfactor cousins back just world as a man Logan is Crowder sprinting towards the pylon or the marker I should say and he's got a first down one of those bright spots Jameson Crowder's turned into an excellent player in his rookie season at a Duke and for fans across the league who haven't seen Jameson Crowder he even had more of an opportunity with DeSean Jackson out to assert himself and become a part of the offense her cousin I really liked his description he said he's wired to separate and so much of this league is about being able to get yourself opened Crowder does it very well time for cousins and that's instantly game break some interesting games going on what do you got first part out of it hey how about little bit more drew brees 7 touchdown passes this week business is third today Michael hull or Manawa knew he gets it they lead 28 to 2004 Tennessee and oh by the way Brees also ran one income wonder how many times Curt said home and now a new way for you that was impressive Curt you know the Saints John early in the year they look they've come back to LA they could go five and four if they win this game second down here and 10 1004 to go on the game cousins and Thompson dropping 2/7 drop that fro wasn't perfect but I mean this is the NFL yeah it shouldn't happen at this level and it started early the very first play of the game and we got a different game I'm not saying Washington's ahead but it's very much a different game if they just catch the ball third down and ten pressure cousin stands in and it's got a completion but that is for it's not gonna be close to a first gonna gain to crowd or the catch hunt time for Washington you know we keep talking about next level quarterbacking with Tom Brady one of the things that Jay Gruden and Kirk Cousins actually brought it up to us is you know he's always been a pleaser he wants to do what the coaches say go through the progression it comes a point in this league where you have to make ad lib plays and Jay Gruden said that is the next step you just that's something he hasn't he hasn't evolved to yet where he's making things happen when they aren't there and that's the next step for good cousins ways kick and Amendola to the sidelines flag flies and we'll see what the penalty is 227 3 Patriots with nine fifteen to go and Tom Brady he always plays late into these games even if they're up biggest has kind of been what would he and Bill Belichick have done holding receiving team number 23 10yard penalty first down timeout here's the panel zing Patriots football up big in Foxborough Patriots in control give its on the ground and that has been a big factor here today the notorious Conor McGregor has taken over the season of The Ultimate Fighter they call me an instigator that's some Omega a wild card and a level so don't miss an allnew Ultima fire Wednesdays only on fs1 patriots on the ground today a hundred and fifty nine yards rushing one week they you at the pass next week it's on the ground here's Blount who's that a majority of those yards fighting for find ways to get it done Kevin Nate you know I don't disagree with Bill Belichick because Who am I he's been so successful on much but you talked about Brady being in here it's senseless to me yeah you got the best player in the league and you got a backup who could use some reps and I always in because they do it off and they blow people out off and like what's he doing in there and I can't answer patrons have scored in 31 straight players only the first quarter of the season they did not third down Grady the thrower and he's got a completion there's Bouldin who makes the catch he's got a first out to the 31 so Dion Lewis gets hurt damn told you he won't be backs hopefully he's okay did walk off under his own power earlier and now Boldin's got a touchdown catch he's got the first down and everybody contributing on a day when they lost their left tackle Ballmer now I think Dashon Goldson is the man that's getting some attention you know Tom Brady you think about it we talked earlier there's not a first round draft pick on this offense and we all know by now that Brady was a six round draft pick who is in the 2000 quarterback draft Plus let's take a look chat painted really good players shoulder injuries ended his career Giovanni Crum on Atlanta didn't work out crisp red men obviously not for him team art national championship Tennessee not in the NFL Marc Bulger good player for the Rams virgin win no Tom Brady sixround Pitt worked out just fine 167 wins other six quarterbacks combined eating up in Championships and it looks some great people passed on Bill Walsh was the guy that picked Giovanni Carr mozzie the late great bill was so people that knew what they were doing but this man has used that as a giant chip on his shoulder it has motivated him it has fueled him and he just been tremendous we'll go down in the conversation is the best ever to play the position ready to throw it hit as he throws incomplete you talked about of the open Brady may be the best he's ever been let's go down to Pam for more on that well Kevin it's extremely rare that Tom Brady looks across the line of scrimmage and gets stumped we talked to Brady about why that's almost always the case is experience and study mainly but even after 16 years Brady told us he anticipates just won't guess people he believes rather that guessing is what gets you in trouble against an opponent he said that mentality even when he goes up against his teammates on defense works defensive coordinator mouth of Tricia can attest to that chess match damn thanks yeah he has seen it all by now and it certainly looks that way isla fail and Brandon LaFell to the 48 yard line a 17 yard game just expanding upon Pam was talking about she asked the question and Tom said look I think I've seen it all but there are times where I'm shocked you see the nice blocking by these guys downfield there are times where I see something I'm not expecting I don't like it he likes to have things predetermine he works so hard so that he anticipates everything and it shows up on the field there's once you know and on that new people think come on guys 38 anyone who is in that age range that I I'm you know I'm not what I used to be when you're younger this everyone feels the phrase changed everything his diet his exercise routine he doesn't really do the weights he has this pliability routine he says I used to be in practice throw 80 balls in my forearm were hurt said I changed everything now it's all about muscle pliability and softness of the tissue and that's his training regimen Wood has been for the last four or five years and he says I never have the soreness and yeah because he says it's important for me not only to play I want to practice because I don't want to miss those reps and so he's able to do all of that and throw the ball still like that at 38 years old on sharp is already and down inside the 35 Patriots on the move what were they of 27 to three with six and chains to go its Breeland on the tackle one of the things he implemented in the recent history is working with a guy named by the name of Tom house a lot of NFL quarterbacks Drew Brees but that's just tightening the mechanics the release time I've never seen him and this is something that usually goes the ability to get rid of the ball quickly that Dan Marino Aaron Rodgers like release he's throwing it and balls out of his hand when he decides quicker than it ever has in his career Brandon LaFell over 100 yards back that's five for 102 draw Leslie live at the blunt he's tackled quickly by two Ron Johnson LeGarrette Blount avid himself today he got a hundred and twenty nine yards on 29 carries today and a touchdown as time is ticking down around the fiveminute mark Patriots about to go eight an O and so now Panthers up on the Packers 32:14 with most of the fourth quarter left in Carolina Bengals already ain't no Denver an Indy tonight in that storyline with Peyton Manning trying to become the alltime most passing yards ironic that it's at Indianapolis kidding write a better script for that second down Brady still in over mil incomplete you know what's even more ironic Kevin I saw a note here at one of the breaks that the Colts and Jim Irsay opened up the roof for Payton Payton who loves everything closed up he wants conditions perfect well they just said you know why we're gonna open there they're the roof for your trip back to any let you see the Sun a little bit meanwhile these Patriots and I know a lot of people looking at 2007 when they were 16 and on the regular season coming up next they're out the Giants we've kind of been their kryptonite obviously Buffalo and then at Denver that game could be for homefield advantage here's Bolden making the catch on a third down and he goes nowhere so we'll see if Belichick keeps the offense out or tries a long field goal with kis Kowski see what he wants to do here with four and a half to go but that game Thanksgiving weekend that'll that'll be something and then the Bengals go to Denver later in the year I mean one of those teams is not kind of a first round by could be enormous oh it's so big you know and I think when you look at teams that could give this team trouble it's the Denver Broncos in my mind because the mix of passrush and coverage because passrush isn't enough against Tom Brady you need the coverage as well and Denver is very deep and the cornerback position and they have multitude of pass rushers got three excellent quarterbacks flag yeah they just let the clock run out so they'll move back five yards the live game 5yard penalty court down cousin's getting his throws in for Washington about our our talk with coach Belichick the other day and he was talking about Lawrence Taylor and starters on special teams Lawrence Taylor was the gunner for the New York Giants the gunner is the guy outside Matthew Slater's playing the gunner right now that was Lawrence Taylor forgot about that when he was with the Giants Crowder takes it goes out of bounds it'll be Washington's football with 351 to go but it's been all New England in this one they've controlled it from start to right now Pat's try to go e and hole that's another 299 yard a two touchdowns for Tom grading how daring he can throw an interception though the second of the year 27 3 patrons Washington football cousins gonna let it fly and he does so over the know this Crowder across the 30 first down with 342 to go as the Pats on the March ain't no because he's trying to get his guys moving here trying to get something on the board hell without a touchdown let's make a bitch cousins just lets it fly for Jax and do as far as you could but it's incomplete want to take you back to 2008 most even diehard football fans won't remember this know John Lynch in a patriot uniform John you were here for a preseason most don't even know that and this was your last game ever there's a fourth preseason game play like a madman that's your last tackle number 47 it does look weird to used to see in a Tampin Denver fourth preseason game what are you doing in the game well there's a funny story that one I may take a little while let this play out no didn't think we're gonna let you get out of here without that here's cousin Citroen and he's got Crowder again tackled in balance but anyway here's the quick version I had left Denver's camp and I thought I was done well Bill Belichick started calling me every day saying we've got a spot we want you to play this single linebacker I come in here right away it hit me I once I had retired that done in Denver I was done mentally so hey just I was trying to make it happen it wasn't happening I went to bill before that last game and I said bill I'm not gonna play this year I'm done but I got one request I want you to let me play the entire fourth preseason he said I can't do that you'll be out there with free agents I said please he did and let me tell you I had some fun it looked like it go lines stand at the end John Thompson was a dump over the middle it's gonna be I think a little short well and you know so what was it like you were here I was only a couple months but what was it like that was a great experience I got to really see what makes this place tick I got developed a great relationship with Bill Belichick I was in his office most nights he was trying to teach me the playbook and I really got to understand Tom Brady and in a short period what makes these guys who they are and what makes this team who they are this is Roberts from Fuzzy's in a New England territory inside the 40 the funny part of that story my old friend and the late great jr. say opera he was at the time coming in every October he said Lynch E you got it all wrong you went to training camp there retired I come in in October and skip training camp okay so you know missed that a little bit but good times here in New England add to your legendary soon be Hall of Fame career twominute warning from New England coming up navigating the State Farm postgame show heard Terry Howie Michael Jimmy how about the Raiders and Steelers Pittsburgh just went ahead in that game Howie and Terry will be going out up there and you'll get bonus coverage of the st. Louis Minnesota game Vikings up three however teddy bridgewater just went out of that game being evaluated for a concussion so we will show you that near on Fox take two good ones going on Carolina just scored again but 36:14 on Green Bay they're gonna go to eight no barring something crazy in the last nine minutes our big story lines cousins the throw blitz coming gets rid of looking a crowd in complete coverage on the play was by : Bostick got some fresh run wits hey Kevin yup good to have you back in football man X moves you for that world series it we miss you Sam Rose and steps in does a great job but you and pete macheska are producer it's great to have you back on the team well we missed you baseball the World Series was great but mr. Powell we have fun rest of the season tom brady and company going remain undefeated nearly unbeatable here at home they will be 49 and 4 here at Fox Bo since the start of 2009 cousins back there is a test to gar\u00e7on inside it's like last minute and change here in New England I'm telling you even that throw right there Kirk Cousins I keep saying it but he can sling the football you know a lot of things have to happen for this team but it's starting to look good that they may have their next quarterback taking care of it with Kirk Cousins at the helm get this one to Thompson on the backfield good times and Thompson inside the 10 you brought up a really good point he's always been the Robert Griffin sub even when he started he knew and he only got told two weeks before the season that he was the start it wasn't like hey all offseason as you're a team he's still growing into it and and I think you have to realize that you got to give him a full year and see what he does he could be the guy and you know one thing I didn't play the quarterback position but I you know as I heard Kirk Cousins talk I had a personality very similar I was a pleaser I wanted to do everything the coach said yeah but the same thing with in terms of leadership sometimes you got to come out of your comfort zone particularly at that position you got to take over this team like Tom Brady that it was something right away when he played it was Drew Bledsoe steam he took over and they knew that was his team he that's the next step for Kirk Cousins really assert himself and there's Harmon the safety who's down for the Patriots so Don Harmon who has had a spectacular year Patriots staff working on him they're not happy the team is being beat today by the way to Ron and Harmon did walk off under his own power good news for the Patriots has been outstanding their safety 46 seconds ago 27 3 New England front of Washington as he was trying to get on the board here first and go a little fade route to read incomplete John after to wish a party good luck to Eric man dia and his wife Lindsey Eric is phenomenal he's our ad and he is a huge glue to our team and we'll miss him next week because they are expecting their first child sometimes during this week and they're gonna be surprised boy or girl it's gonna be great I'm so happy for him Lindsey another great an important employee at the Fox Network she hadn't even missed work yet we working right 200 the deadline so good luck and congratulations to you guys cousins second and goal pressure daddy goes second set of the day it's a team Hicks the former signal flag no that's just a Redskins shoe oh it is a Class A goal automatic first down Terry McCauley would let us shoot him with the camera we could show you the penalty but he's trying to be quicker than Tom Brady in that release Terry McCauley he's under to point point two seconds every penalty got an early flight out of Logan job it's funny cause a couple the Redskin players have on the the yellow shoes and they look like flags if you look real quick alright so 33 seconds ago first and goal have to pit after the penalty for unit three trying to faint again and complete think it's a Garcon coverage from Logan Ryan Logan Ryan's playing really well again I just astounding you lose Darrelle Revis arguably the best corner in football Brandon browner who had his own skill set and yet you still say you know what we're gonna play mantoman defense we're gonna challenge everyone and Logan Ryan has made that a lot easier as has that man Malcolm Butler Ryan John has six tackles he's got fourth interception today that's a teamhigh second and goal is Paul's touchdown Jordan read and so before Washington gets out of here they get on the board with a touchdown this is a creative route with all that mantoman defense you run some traffic they almost run into each other but it also provides the space necessary for Jordan Reed working against Jordan Richards the rookie from Stanford and it really well thrown football by cousins so Reno had two touchdowns two weeks ago versus Tampa on the board here he's been quiet today though the Patriots have done a nice job keeping him quiet just his third catch for 19 yards extra point is good map Patricia defensive corner for the Patriots is like come on max you got it trust me only 25 seconds left 27:10 New England about to go eat no on this season second time in their history they've done that of course the last was oh seven when they were 16 you know in the regular season and they lost in that unbelievable Super Bowl to the Giants they look every bit as daunting here this year all the way back to get the fictional slide down the one is Devin McCourty thought an onside kick was coming but they kicked it off so the court he went and got it Jay Gruden and his boys would go home with a loss unable to win one on the road all three of their wins at home this year Jimmy Garoppolo gets to kneel they finally give him the snap are to the brain trust bill belichick and defensive coordinator Matt patrician I can't say enough about the job Matt Patricia has done with this young and talented defense couple good football minds great football minds in that shot Garoppolo gets a knee he gets to play he gets to England another win behind Tom Brady who was stellar again two touchdowns 299 yards the one game was outstanding for New England they ran for 161 bonus coverage of a Big E in Minnesota between the Vikings and the Rams is coming up next on Fox final score 27 for New England 10 for Washington for Pam Oliver and John Lynch and our entire crew on Kevin Burkhardt enjoy the rest of the games everyone so on you",

  "transcript": "right now temperature in the 60s with a high near 70 the Sun is out it for the second time this year the roof here in this outstanding facility in Glendale Arizona is open the Saints won the toss and deferred to the Cardinals set to receive let's check in with Jennifer Hale record for the most consecutive games with at least 100 yards from scrimmage he says he's playing to repay his team from putting himself in this position he says with great response with great success comes great responsibility and he feels like it's on his shoulders to uplift this team during its difficult time Chris thank you very much these two teams the Cardinals of course the defending NFC west champs the Saints actually true freeze they're still mathematically in it as he talked about this week coming off a couple of rough games the Saints need to win their remaining three games and hope that Atlanta and Tampa Bay would both lose their remaining three games and then Sean Payton's team would have a shot winning the NFC South Division but struggling through another season both of these head coaches you just expected more coming into the year from these teams a lot more especially from the Arizona Cardinals and in my book I thought this was a team that was gonna lost their way back into the playoffs and give themselves a chance but as it stands we're here week 15 and we're still gonna have a good game here Chris and Britton golden from his own endzone across the 22 yard line where the Arizona offense will begin with Carson Palmer who comes in starting 13 of the 14 games this season member missed week 5 with a concussion against the 49ers he will turn 37 years old on December the 27th and with this offense around him no Michael Floyd his DUI this week then released then signed by the Patriots so a different assortment of receivers to go to against the Saints defense and also dealing with the shuffle of the offensive line John Wetzel goes to left tackle and you got many new guys in there Tyler Boggs gets his first start so see if they're able to hand stand up today help their quarterback who's been taking a beating all season long Fitzgerald incomplete Taylor Boggs starting at right guard with DJ Humphries the left tackle and concussion protocol Saints defense gets Craig Robertson back the team's leading tackler he was out last week stuff on Anthony is inactive with a knee injury so his Delvin Breaux out with a left shoulder and Vaughn Bell to me taking that role of Kenny Vaccaro gonna be that kind of strong safety down in a box kind of player and got that three safety look keep an eye on him all day today I think he's a really good football player Carlin balloted running back here and the Wildcat last week a flag flies and the ball is rolling towards the 24 yard line there's a scramble for it like Williams got the ball back offside number 48 defense lined up in the neutral zone fiveyard penalty remains second down referencing Vaughn Bell the rookie from Ohio State he just talked about but the handoff between Carson Palmer and Kerwin Williams similar to last week where the turnovers were an issue in the bad weather in Miami and that was the crux of their problems last week then obviously the weather is going to be perfect here in Arizona but the turnover potential still exists here sloppy play to start this game floats one for JJ on the last three times touched the football he scored touchdowns he's got a big opportunity today with Michael Floyd no longer being here him and John Brown these two guys last year were such a big part of this offense but I look at these guys just numberswise nobody on this team as that receiver has more than 15 yards for Ken that was such a big reason this team was successful last year just hasn't materialized so far this year it's all the seasons almost open so for this just two games to play Kerwin Williams in the backfield on third and five open catch made for a first down around the 36 yard line as andre ellington the backup to david johnson makes the catch and i think it's this season goes on here towards these last three games we'll see more and more of that of Andre Ellington and we've had these guys a number of time and Bruce Arians has told us they're trying to find ways to get him more involved than I play he was lined up as a wide receiver picks up the first down and decent protection with that makeshift offensive line for Palmer who said I'm not dreading it as much as you guys are meeting the media concerned about it coming into this to get across the 40yard line comes in with 11 rushing touchdowns for receiving touchdowns he's already a thousand yard rusher and over 1,800 scrimmage yards it's just so many positives when you talk about David Johnson I'm just excited for him for his future if here at Arizona Cardinal fan it can't get any better than to have a back like this and it you know coming into his prime such a humble guy look for great things from them just celebrated his 25th birthday pressin poverty' Larry Fitzgerald has it at midfield and it is 200 years his 200th career game 92 catches for this season for Larry and the consecutive string of catches and games goes all the way back to his rookie year while there's no question that Larry Fitzgerald gets involved in the game early he always does and Carson Palmer knows he can trust him I don't know that in their past verse 15 that two or three balls aren't designated to go to Larry just to keep that thing going got a wildcat direct snap with Palmer bottom of the screen as your receiver I'm pretty sure that New Orleans Saints saw this last week I'm not sure how they're not prepared the only difference is last week he ranted in free time to the other side and he who spit without his chute for an amazing run by Kerwin Williams 49yard and for Kerwin Williams reaching the end zone to give their rizona the early lead well you know it's this just gonna fake David Johnson keeps keeping these he's not even giving David Johnson a chance this is his one opportunity to touch the football watch this shoot comes off doesn't matter I'm gonna go 64 touchdown the extra point always an adventure with these two teams while the new putter the holder is Catanzaro delivers Fitzgerald blocking and allowing the first touchdown of the season for Kerwin Williams and the second of his career and the Cardinals strike first today's game is sponsored by Southwest history low beard with nothing to hide that's transparency well the Cardinals get on the board early unlike last week on the road they've been a much better team at home but they marched 78 yards and the Wildcat Kerwin Williams 49 yard run gives Arizona the lead Catanzaro kicking off and Tommy Lee Lewis downs it so from the 25yard line Drew Brees will take over he leads the NFL in passing yards the last couple of weeks six interceptions and no touchdowns first time in his career he's done that and backtoback games that combo first time since 2009 that he hasn't had touchdowns in backtoback games and actually gone with nine quarters without throwing a touchdown that's the second longest streak of his career but reset this week Ronde I've thrown enough interceptions I know how to fix ultimate competitor Drew Brees he'll be back we get a chance to see it today looking forward to his Redemption game world here he comes out throwing from the pocket protection good but the ball tipped away trying to go to Brandon Coleman Kevin mentor making the defensive play with the deflection left tackle Toronto Armstrong remains out he went on injured reserve this week so like the Cardinals the Saints have had to shuffle their offensive line a little bit and Mark Ingram comes in averaging over five yards to carry over nearly 800 rushing yards the matchup today is Andres Pete 75 playing left tackle fulltime against Chandler Jones on that left side to keep an eye on it all day with a first down up to the 39 yard line and ball was juggled a little bit and we've got a cardinal down Tony Jefferson already thin in the secondary with some injuries off of last week today's game is sponsored by Bud Light make the right call drink responsibly Tony Jefferson being dumped on the sidelines DJ swears her entire Matthew who's back for this week the safeties after a 14 yard run from Agra Brees throw away is Campbell the longest tenured defensive player for the Cardinals up front they all Buchan of the team's leading tackler what on injured reserve as Jefferson comes back in how do you think the Saints and Brees will attack no Buchanan in this game I think they'll be Canon his mother more active linebackers in football won't be interesting to see I see a more holds up in there in his spot second down six it's Ingram it's up to the 48 of New Orleans will you talk about the New Orleans Saints offense their struggles the past couple of weeks and to me it's been their lack of a running game no Mark Ingram was nicked up with the toe and the knee injuries but they've been severely out of balance the past two weeks it puts way too much pressure on the quarterback no matter how good he's playing they still struggle they lead the NFL and third down efficiency just over 48 percent its third and one the pitch to Ingram it's the first down inside the Cardinal 47 yard line part of the problems to the last couple of weeks for the Saints were they had 13 penalties in the game the loss against the Buccaneers we mentioned the interceptions by Drew Brees and drop passes as well well you mentioned the penalties the penalties is the big four the biggest thing because Sean Payton was telling us you get so far behind the stick second and ten third and ten the off schedule somewhat you can't run the football and those penalties or killers see if they can lend them today right away the Cardinal defense ready as Tony Jefferson came up to make the tackle let's get a game break so had a charissa top sir thanks Chris a what a game here the Bears battled back from down 17 in the fourth but don't give Aaron Rodgers the ball because this is a 60 yard to Jordy Nelson in thanks charissa with the Lions losing at the kinds dramatic win for the Packers and Brees throwing open us Brandon cooks right at the sticks inside the 37 yard line of Arizona well troop reads what he said I know how to fix it it's I'm gonna still play my game be aggressive but I but I know what not to do obviously that the weaker throw the gamble throw the turnover in crucial situations in the past couple of weeks he hasn't been able to make that thrown out and efficiently Drew Brees was was really bad last week I mean 61 percent passing when it comes in 71 percent yeah it sounds like he's down I trust this guy to get back on track today cardinal Tim Hightower with his first carry of this game gets near another New Orleans first down drafted by Arizona out of Richmond still has great memories and is grateful for his career opportunity beginning with a great block right here by John Phillips to seal this edge C Taylor Jones and another one by 83 Willie Snead on Tony Jefferson and just gives Tim Hightower lots of room to get that further down ball start number 65 offense and in this building the last ten years opposing teams have had more false starts than in any other stadium that's now a hundred and forty seven since 2006 you would think that places like Seattle would would lead here and now that's that least the narrative across the league but it's just as tough to play in here got great crowd noise in here when this defense is on the field so instead of a first down out second and six after the penalty Hightower not down at the 30 it'll bring 1/3 a few heights our did mention this week that he had a lot of people to talk to from this original T but we'll do it after the after the game he said there's a little bit of show you show you something in this game for me for sure a great story Tim I tell obviously we know about it with the injury started here in Arizona having a great year as a complementary player to Mark Ingram in his back fool third down and three the pitch to Bart Ingram who's got the first increments at the 20 of Arizona and that's part of the running game that Sean Payton said sometimes you just gonna have to toughen up the yards you have to have it you absolutely have to be able to do this this the second time today on third and short where you would think that they would throw the football if you're believing in Drew Brees but watch Willie Snead right here the block on Chandler Jones against Prince Mark Ingram picks up the first down it's an additional yardage good play by the New Orleans Saints only 14 carries in the last couple of weeks combined he's already carried five times today cadet Gizem breeze is going to be sacked at the 29 by coleus Campbell his fifth sack of the season all it scalia's Campbell working on cine Ocala midday that matchup right there he just whips them this dude is a monster inside the Swim movie gloom with power obviously can win with quickness that's a big yardage loss for the New Orleans Saints here make it second Wow 15 or 16 and this is what I was talking about the Saints sacks penalties they get behind the sticks this is where they struggle a little bit Heights our in after a loss of Baden Heights our the 21 yard line Kevin Miller making the play have to get down to the 10 or inside the tend to get in first down and on third down for the Saints these are the situations that the Saints wanted to avoid third and long against the Arizona Cardinals defense and you and I know Chris James specters if the coordinator is going to try to dial up some kind of pressure see what he calls here on third and 12 the Cardinals blitz more than any team in the league instead of Rhonda Mark Ingram with a fourman rush and he gets inside of the 20 but it's fourth down we were wrong on both counts right he's not gonna run the pressure he's gonna play soft zone that's New Orleans Saints playing it's safe trying to hand off the ball try to spring them but good job by this Arizona defense buckling down after some big plays early by the New Orleans Saints done interesting call on third and long so a 37yard field goal try will Lutz has made six straits and suffering the block at Carolina back in November to get the Saints crowd there delivers Cardinals take their first possession for a touchdown the Saints answer with three today's game is sponsored by the new bacon King sandwich only at Burger King I know the commitment of the run but Saints fans third and 12 down in that area inside the 25 of Arizona to call a run maybe he's trying to make a commitment to his team that yes we're gonna run it and behind the sticks again they've had so many mistakes on offense the last couple of games I understand Weis trying to play it safe but yeah I definitely have questionable call by Sean Payton offense will lunch with the kick and went and golden coming out again in his own endzone up to the 20 and taking people with him across the 25 yard line the healthy looking return as the Cardinals take over on offense with a fourpoint lead today's game on Fox is sponsored by AT&amp;T brant canyon nearby and david johnson AZ arizona gets the football for the second time the offensive line has been reshuffled as we have a trashed Johnson it's up near the 30 and that's what Bruce Arians said Ronde that it gives a chance for young players to kind of step up at this point of the season and it's a playing charge yeah aside from the fact that they movement at John Wetzel the left tackle and her Wofford to right gives tailored Boggs a chance to get some tape out there and nobody knows about I don't really know if I had to ask coach you know give me something on him he said he's smart tough player he might struggle with some power but he's got a tough matchup today Nick Fairley on the other side has had a great year for the New Orleans Saints and I think if you're your camp tour and looking at what's all over there you got to look at your chops today backwards invest inflate and the balls out and the Saints around it's Craig Robertson it was that extra attempt by Fitzgerald to slip out of a tackle and the Saints with a takeaway yeah Larry Fitzgerald trying to do a little bit too much right here in traffic in you know just quick little slant completion it's a little hot route that they run a lot but watch the Kruger come in here ninety nine and just affect that ball pull it out Robertson right on the spot to get the takeaway for the New Orleans Saints now curse this is the area where this defense of the Arizona Cardinals has to step up in my mind they've had so many sudden change opportunities and haven't been able to stop people from scoring see if see what they're able to do here today and Robertson one of those bright spots for the Saints defense this year the tower to the 25yard line robertson didn't play last week Stefan Anthony stepped in back in that middle linebacker spot Anthony as we mentioned inactive and Robertson leading the team and tacklers tackles this year the top tackler former Cleveland Brown from the 26yard line second down four minute mark of the opening quarter mantoman coverage breeze to condemn who drives inside that's running that good good eyes their partner in that mantoman look right there you know you we know that because Tony Jefferson what splits out to the other side covered in a tight end Peterson we talked about the matchup with Michael Thomas and that leaves Co more right there on to various cadet and that's the matchup the Saints won no they have an advantage they're good quick decision by Drew Brees a good catch I took that they're four out of five so far for greens just a couple so they call that they used to say Patrick Peterson would be traveling with Michael Thomas will they call that star coverage now is that I he stars him I'd like to call it cat coverage you take that cat I'll take this cat Peterson is the guy on this defense who finds the premium primo matchup I call him premium matchup to the week and when Aaron knows mint mantoman situations I think today we're going to see him in 13 have a nice Mark Ingram we're ready for that it'll be third down the Falcons have just gone in front of the 49ers 14 to nothing in Atlanta well tired Matthew was back after Mitch Mitch missing some games he's right here playing that safety nickel role and I was wondering how he would react to that shoulder earlier we saw it tackling through a shoulder in there and it's pretty good to me so far Chris from New Orleans Corsa Pro Bowler LSU Starnes battled some injuries back for this one after a loss of three its third and 11 breeze at the 26yard line personal foul face mask number 44 defense about the dishes for goal first down that's on Marcus golden as Carl Jeffers is our referee today well that was good defense by the Arizona Cardinals and where's he at he's right there on the end of your line of sydney line of scrimmage working on Andrews feet he's had a great year he can work with power and speed but that is illegal so instead of fourth down the penalty gives the Saints a first down inside the 10 where it's first on goal Jim Hightower around the rivets we're adjourned came up from the safety spot DJ swear inter enforcer on the back end of his defense know when Tyrone was out they need his guy to step up the play it was him Tony Jefferson's MVP in my mind of his defense the way he's played this year but a guy like DJ Swearengen layin hits like that statement breeze whoa and incomplete Willie Snead the target great play by Tony Jefferson here playing a little bit of a bracket coverage on Snead on this guy watch him make this play right here we see tire Matthew let him go inside and then Tony Jefferson has been doing this all season long and he's a great tackler it's also showing well in past coverage earn and goal from the tan of Arizona breathe the other way zone touchdown Saints he reached the bottle across the plane as soon as he caught it and the fumble recovery by Robertson leads to a Saints touchdown I want you to watch Patrick Peterson's eyes right here these are greedy eyes right here look at him look at the quarterback he completely misses the pivot Ralph might reverse cadet and that's close let's check this out on this angle and see if he's has possession of this football as he crosses the goal line that's close man any part of the ball before the knee touched it looked like he got it right there touchdown and it has been confirmed as all scoring plays our cadet with his second touchdown of the season and drew brees ends that string extra point by Lux is good and the Saints now have a 10 to 7 lead briefs with his first touchdown of the last twoplus games Atok NFL undisputed weekdays 9:30 to noon that's Eastern Time and you'll see it on fs1 after the fumble recovery a 30 yard drive on the fifth career touchdown catch fort Rivera's cadet the Cardinals have fumbled more than any other team in the NFL this year in the Saints were able to take advantage what's written golden another opportunity from his own goal line knocked out of bounds with Ronde Barber Chris Myers and starting Christmas week festive time here in the in the stadium what's her early read on this team drew brees one thing looks very focused and he's the kind of guy who responds well after having tough games always I love his comments during the week and it wasn't quite that don't panic but yeah he's throwing interceptions in the past the offenses struggled in the past but you got to appreciate his approach to football and that he's gonna go work at it it's showing up today I think he'll have a bounceback kind of game but his offense of the Arizona Cardinals Chris is gonna have to answer him all day today and find a way to protect the football 20 touchdowns and 13 interceptions but last year he was one of the fewest sacked quarterbacks this year carson palmer has been sacked among the top five the most did these guys just a number of hits that he's taken the sacks are one thing but the boost that he's taking when he drops back the past he gotta find a way to get the ball out of his hands quicker did the body's playmakers Kerwin Williams is in a running back excellent tackle from Roman Harper and looks like the ball was loose and the Saints got it in fact or I should say the Cardinals got it back and it is remaining Arizona football a lot of to back Kerwin Williams David Johnson type assets that I haven't seen very frequently for the Arizona Cardinals I'm seeing David Johnson line up as a receiver as much as I'm seeing him line up in the backfield definitely a new wrinkle for Bruce Arians offense first quarter winding down a 30second timeout and a timeout here with 11 seconds remaining you know that observation I think it's probably because as a Michael Floyd machine receiver who's a starter you know this has been an offense that's been mostly Arizona Cardinals offense I mean an offense it's mostly been three wide receivers on third down that third down flying up there was only two receivers on the field Larry Johnson John Brooke John Brown and two tight ends so this is kind of a departure from what we've seen out of this risk get no biscuit offensive Bruce Arians this season and John Brown with only 31 catches who still is battling that sickle cell trait which has affected his health and his amount of blank time with the first across the 46yard line what you're gonna see here I mean David Johnson he's lined up just just outside of the edge of the tackle so you kind of know that he's going out for a route but this is what sprung it clearly within the oneyard line of scrimmage good play by Arizona Saints take a turnover and take the lead but the Cardinals are on the move after one quarter in Arizona a moment ago Sean Payton used a timeout when his team was on defense he wanted another look this was ruled down by the carry of the officials looked like there might have been a fumble he was maybe considering challenging that but not a clear replay and so we move on but a lost timeout for the Saints and the Cardinals continuing to move with David Johnson he gets the carry nearly 49 yard line great cut there by David Johnson he's just ability to change direction it's the big man he's not like he's a little scat kind of back he's 220 pounds 6 1 he mentioned Ronde that the scouts when he came out of college said he runs too upright and he's not to prove them wrong extra pressure coming gets rid of it to those who's falling inside the 45 to be close enough to measure for a first a let's get a break check it again at Garissa thanks Chris a crazy day the AFC's bench in the first half for the Texans win 2120 and then the Titans on the road of game winning a huge win for them both teams now tied at 86 christened at home Tennessee was down 17 7 on the road at that point the game the Saints care about is Atlanta and they're winning at home 14 nothing over the 49ers in the opening quarter to David Johnson pounds around the 41 42 yard line of Arizona Johnson a triplet himself and mentioned that his wife Megan do with their first child a young son that they expect in January excited for me this is a mature young man now and talking to their ownership last week when we had these guys that you just don't believe that he's as good as he is me obviously is a great football player but he's humble in the way he approaches his job his group for a guy like this and yeah congratulations on the baby his life will change left side of this defensive line when these two guys line up together watch the early penetration by Nick Fairley over the rookie Taylor bog not the rookie but first year starting Taylor Boggs just whiffs on him and a cam tour and there to clean up this sack of Carson Palmer box and his fifth year from Humboldt State of free India he said rut he was with the Bears said I spent a half a decade trying to get a starting job and I would give one it's against the skin yeah well he's gonna have to do better than that Negi a you feel bad for him going to get some nick Farrell I think has had one of the great year Sheldon Rankin's is in the game too he's gonna have to deal with him today too Johnson is a receiver makes a nice little move to get inside the 40 down to the 37 of the six one thing that David Johnson does better than anybody I've ever seen is just feel like the shadow of the defender and he's avoiding guys before they're even in the picture and the guy he's got such as quick lateral movement a lot of times you're like how does he see that guy but he does it's always finding positive yardage whether it's out of the backfield receiver or as a runner Sean Payton News scattered him said we knew he was a great receiver and Payton who played at Eastern Illinois in his college day said wagai a Northern Iowa we like that conference that's always good to see somebody rise from a buffer just off his fingertips he had him all the way here Chris this throw just a touch too heavy but he had a matchup that he wanted I'm not sure who the corner inside corner here is here cover now it's Vaughn Bell so yes speed versus the rookie he had a beat that ball is just a little less weighted that's a touchdown for John Brown so a field goal try a 55 yards Catanzaro made from 56 new holder is Matt while he's the new partner he's never held before signed as they released through Butler this week after a number of misuse of special teams Saints will have good field position after the defense stalls out the Arizona offense and the miss field goal today's game on Fox is sponsored by citizen echo drive watch is powered by light they miss field goal you can't blame the execution on this one Bruce Arians is not happy he might be thinking of a different type of execution that's Amos Jones the special teams coordinator they've had these types of problems all year long yes you're right snap hold perfect kick pushed new holder and punter who actually kicked punted against in a couple of games for Atlanta subbing against the Cardinals and they were impressed and signed him this week with great field position for the Saints pulls it in in Cardinal territory how about the idea of being aggressive with that field goal trying knowing you're giving this Saint offense good field position if you don't get it I think they gotta find ways to execute kicks I don't think Bruce Arians in his mind is thinking that your guys gonna miss it they've had a lot of faith in Chandler Catanzaro over the years but this year he struggled I mean pushing pulling a lot of his kicks and that's just another one sets up the Saints with really good field position at midfield Sarah now 16 out of 20 to field goal attempts as Mark Ingram carries you can definitely feel a commitment to the run game here early in this football game Ingram already got six carries you mentioned that he only had 14 the other the other week but the balance it's there it helps their defense like we talked like we've talked about with this team in the past but it just helps your offens getting a rhythm stay ahead of the sticks you could do that when you're running the football if he averages 76 yards a game over the final three he'll be a thousand yard rusher at Marquette from the first since Deuce McAllister for the Saints first catch of the game Thomas who missed last week you talked about in the open Rada he leads in all major categories among rookie receivers with catches and yards and touchdowns and his big physical presence was missed in the loss last week to Tampa Bay I think it's interesting what Sean Payton told us you know Michael Thomas does all the sticky stuff whatever that means to this offense catching the tough passes and he's so good at the line of scrimmage that he's definitely a factor but he was in the game to the 35yard line just short it would appear off the first down now you're getting great blocking up front that guard tackle combination there and that's city of Andrews Pete doing their job on the left side is offensive line open up some nice holes for Mark Ingram Falcons now with a 21 to nothing lead over the 49ers in Atlanta that game of the second quarter Falcons the tape of a time with the division is John Coon Terri's and again the third down conversions nobody better this year in the league than the saints but Cardinals were up to that challenge and it looks like it's fourth down they get a measurement here and you see the numbers Sean Payton's offense impressive on fourth down as well as those third down conversions that's a lot of fourth down conversions to go with but when you got to figure when you're on the plus side of the 50 no reason to attempt the long field OB in the same situation that they just got from the Cardinals why not go for it down here no reason to punt it see what they come up with you and very short I'm out here in the Saints will use their second and Sean Payton is frustrated a lot of clock was running off the play clock and the Saints will consider of their situation with the timeout after the timeout Saints pass up a 53yard field goal tribe they need a yard from inside the 35 of Arizona breathe Willie Snape on the first down it's a thirty of Arizona good job drew brees here finding the receiver back across the middle of the football field here you would think that he'd be looking out to the flat on this swap action but with leesneed sneaking underneath the defense finds a little bit of space and good delivering first down Saints spreading the ball around already seven different players have caught a pass in this game for Drew Brees spotted right at the 30 Brees Snee first down it's at the 20 down around the 17 there's a flag down back where Brees let the ball go number 75 offense Andrus peat secondyear player from Stanford called for the penalty negates a first down game well here's the matchup I mentioned early in the football game Andrus peat playing left tackle happened to work against Chandler Jones their leading sack guy and that's the hold right there to see pulls him to the ground he's imploring the flag and he got it Chandler Coates also leads the team in forced fumbles now it's a first in 20 stead of a 12 yard pickup extra pressure breeze gets rid of it but Kevin Vetter was there great play by Kevin mentor he was a little bit behind and coverage here on Mark Ingram and trouve Reese saw this he identified that Kevin mentor right there is a little bit out of position tries to get this ball out quick to Ingram but watch him finish on the football through his hands nice play men are one of four LSU players on this defense three that are active today Hightower comes in from the 43 these Cardinals what a great play by Markus golden forced the fumble yeah 6/8 camel over 300 pounds sailed into the endzone a great play by the Marcus golden here and that monster clay is Campbell finishing to the touch end zone for a touchdown watch golden he's right here I'm sorry he's at the top of your screen is golden but that's coleus Campbell you see the the forced fumble and then Callay is Campbell trotting in Jim Hightower give credit he almost chased him down but what a great defensive play by the Arizona Cardinals the extra point I mean this is unbelievable it's no good by Chandler Catanzaro we'll take a closer look at the snap and hole but disappointment from Brees and from the Cardinal special teams but the first career touchdown for coleus Campbell today's game is sponsored by the $10 any Pizza carry a deal only at Pizza Hut so for extra points miss looks like the snap and hold we're good perfect executing there the center holder and whipped it left something's in the head of Cardinal kicker Chandler Catanzaro of his last seven kick attempts field goals or extra points he's missed five for various reasons and now kicking off Cardinals already cut their putter they may have to change Drew Brees the last time after the sack fumble return by coleus Campbell let's check in with Jennifer well Chris that touchdown was especially sweet for coleus because after nine years with the Cardinals he is a free agent next season so potentially this could be his final game here in this stadium I talked to him pregame and he was a little emotional he's getting a little teary he said you know I just want to enjoy the ride and soak up every moment and my goodness it's gonna be one for him to remember Chris you think that he remains the Cardinal I do think he stays here and he's been at playing in a pro Bowman he's hilarious exactly exactly right and this is a great picture by Carson Palmer talking to his kicker probably wants to say a word to him but good catch by Willie Sneed and swear injure putting the hit on him at a veteran move a classy move by Carson Palmer and a leadership role beyond the quarterback position it can only imagine what's going through Chandler Catanzaro 's head right now it probably feels like nothing in the world is going right for him given opportunities perfect snapped holes like we said and still missing but they're gonna need him the rest of this game hopefully gets a chance to redeem himself he started his career with 17 consecutive field goals it's been a difficult stretch in the last couple of seasons touchdown so much for that to game no touchdown streak to breezes 65 yards his second touchdown of the game and still six minutes flush remaining in the half well you're gonna see a real breakdown in this Cardinals secondary this is cover two he's gonna sit in a flat and watch your safety right here deejay swear injure get turned around all Brandon cooks did was look to the sideline he went with them left the middle of the field wide open easy throw and catch big touchdown for the Saints Riis 11 out of 14 he comes back after the fumble flags are down as the extra point is good from will Lutz it's a big plays in his game already criticism but we figured with these two offenses you would have excitement didn't expect the coleus Campbell touchdown Rumble check on this flag Carl Jeffers number 28 that penalty will be enforced on the kickoff timeout that's a special teams just in devil but cooks racing into the end zone and the saints come back for a 1713 lead here in the second quarter gamebreaker Brandon cooks the former firstround draft pick he had a 98 yard touchdown catch and carry week 1 against the Raiders an 87yard her against Carolina in week 6 and then 65 yards here moments ago against the Cardinals at lunch kicking off a little further up after the penalty Britton golden they want the return good special teams play the Orleans knocking him down around the 17 yard line not as if the during the return holding number 70 return team out the distance to the ball first down Evan bein called full the infraction you'll see it right in the middle your screen it's pretty obvious these are two teams where special teams you know you could say the Cardinals it's cost him three games this year the Saints have had their share of special team issues that have affected their record in close games three and six and games decided by within six points that you wonder why good teams good team with personnel good personnel lose football games and that's why it's upgrades between offensive defense usually but when you lose in that battle targa win football games Carson Palmer hoping to respond next three yards a good bring them down sir make Gresham has really come on strong here the last couple of weeks Nate's two bar is the injured Saint let's check in on the Falcons say hi again to charissa Thompson thanks Chris so they were at 14 nothing when rookie Austin Hooper watching the Buccaneers playing the Cowboys tonight in that NFC South a stoop are continues to be work done and he's been a valuable football player for the New Orleans Saints this year obviously comes in as a special teams guy but the number of snaps that he's taken on defense this year been crucial especially during their tough patch with some injuries that linebacker or some ineffectiveness that linebacker and looks like they're gonna take him right into the locker room here and find out what's wrong with that right knee next week special Saturday edition the NFL on Fox start off Christmas Eve with a kickoff show America's number one pregame show and then a full slate of action Cardinals will be in Seattle congratulations winners of the NFC West and the Saints will be hosting the Buccaneers Jameis Winston but second down 20yard line carpals office does a lot of these type of throws when they get abnormal a number of people in the box Carson Palmer has a great understanding with his receivers just pick up throw it out there instead of trying to run through seven eight nine guys in the Box let you receiver pick up the one yard good play first down we saw Palmer talking to the kicker moments ago despite a frustrating game for him last week he did lead the Cardinals back to tie that game in Miami at the three minute before down right away by the same defense it'll be second down audit David Johnson out of the battle backfield again Kerwin Williams in it running back David Johnson lined up outside watch Larry Finch careful there's a lot of sure receiver but he does a lot of this to man beaten up guys and blocking he'll block defensive end he'll block who ever live backers great asset at 33 years old still going strong in front of JJ Nelson it'll be third down that's just a bad throw by Carson Palmer JJ Nelson had great separation on V W up the corner out there and this balls got to hit him in the chest instead it's low and outside and it's the poor pass pw webb leading the Saints in passes defended this year and having to play more of a role with Delvin Breaux out with that left shoulder now Ellington David Johnson and Kerwin Williams will come in for the Cardinals on third down Fitzgerald in the slot but it's going to be fourth down which stand by the Saints defense it's gonna say great stand by the Saints defense these guys have done a really nice job past couple of weeks and I know they've lost some games when they played well but you know one thing that they do is they give you a chance you know obviously the often struggled two weeks in a row but they were in football games because their defense stood up played well and they're doing it again today Matt while making his Cardinal debut against and sticks that somewhere between the 35 and 40 yard line of the saints new orleans takes over with the lead on the road was interesting when you were talking to Sean Payton he said I don't have any doubt what's in the mind of my quarterback about this week in terms of being prepared fighting back after a couple of weeks of a struggling offense it's about who's coming with them and I think Sean Payton recognized that Drew Brees was very vocal about that he knows they're struggling he knows he struggled last week especially you know in crunch time against Tampa when he had to make the throws he wasn't able to make it but they'll go back to work like I said having Michael Thomas back will help him opens up some passing opportunities for Brandon cooks which you've already seen today so I we were I was expecting a bounceback game and so far we've seen it Sean Payton said some of that was on me Brees today it's a short pass tonight our cross the 41 yard line when you've been together as long as Sean Payton and Drew Brees have been together you think alike in good times and in bad absolutely I honestly think Drew Brees to go out and call a game himself and Sean Payton has to do a good job kind of covering his quarterback because you know Drew Brees will try to do too much or do it by himself and running game like we said is up today Michael Thomas that's complete he said yeah this Porter bag works with a chip on his shoulder he always has had that he just attached to it yeah I think that started however many years ago when he left San Diego but I appreciate the way he approaches the game of football no one does has done it better good enough for a first down he made the point Sean Payton that you don't want to have your quarterback have all this yardage and then go home a loser at the end of the game he gave some not to be mentioned examples first outreach to throw by Marcus Cooper Marcus Cooper this is a great play on Michael Thomas the guy is he gives up some catches but he's got some great footwork at time watch this pedal right here it's nice and clean gets stays square when he needs to and he was trying to pick that thing good play Cardinals got a touchdown run from Kerwin Bell that a defensive touchdown from coleus Campbell from Kerwin williams excuse me the Saints in a 65 yard touchdown pass a moment ago taking the lead as Tim Hightower carries it already Brees with a couple of touchdowns as we near the twominute warning Saints have one timeout Cardinals have all three the twominute barked Saints leading here in Arizona 1713 big follow your favorite team all season long go to iTunes comm slash NFL the young excited fan here in Glendale Arizona at the University of Phoenix Stadium he knows christmas is coming but the playoffs not so sure for these two not looking good put the Saints with the lead and Brees persist is the most explosive offense in football their 56 their plays of 20 plus yards 56 of them coming into this football game and I got to tell you what this is this ends up being a mismatch Brandon cooks ends up on Tyrann Mathieu who's just coming back from shoulder knee problems and watch the afterburners ain't nobody catching him second long touchdown of the day for Brandon cooks and his offenses on track today for Drew Brees during the 200yard mark a 2413 saints league talked about looking motivated they'd see that look on friend and cooks face there he is a couple of weeks ago we had the game where he didn't get a catch and a flow out of the Los Angeles Rams and he comes out publicly wanting to be fed with the football but he's gotten his opportunity last week with Michael Thomas being out and this week he has been the man he's only 510 and that's right around where Drew Brees is so the little guys come up big Brandin cooks for catches over a hundred 20 yards of a couple of touchdowns first round pick in 2014 he was the 20th choice overall that year and the compo of his speed and the size of Michael Thomas the rookie from Ohio State as something Brees can smile about well last year these two teams play Patrick Peterson followed Brandon but cooks all across the field I don't know what they're thinking and on this Carolina Cardinal sideline I'm sorry they might want to reconsider who put him back on Brandon cooks with this game that he's having here comes Britten golden out of the end zone inside the 20 treviris cadet who has a touchdown catch making the special teams boil week 15 the Giants hold off the Lions and a defensive struggle Green Bay beat Chicago that tightens things up in the NFC north Falcons are leading the 49ers 217 in Atlanta as they play on the second quarter and here Cardinals and Saints going at it and already Saints with the 11point lead chap near the 44 yard line at a first down floated in their Butte is Levi Palmer all three timeouts for the Cardinals great throw by Carson Palmer there Jermaine Gresham just working through this zone coverage wide open that's John 45 lakh still running Arizona uses the timeout say you either take a timeout here or you throw the ball in the ground clock it they got the number they still got two timeouts left after this play so yeah you have to find a way to manage the football game in two minutes situations Carson Palmer is great at it is head coach Bruce Arians play caller is great at it look for a lot of quick completions with two timeouts remaining coming up the Visa halftime report the playoff scenario will be covered up to the moment the Eagles eliminated from playoff contention the loser of this game between the Saints and Cardinals will be officially eliminated plus highlights of all the other games going on Houston the Texans rally to win same for the Titans who we're on the road and the coast blowing out Minnesota I think it's important for the Cardinals to go in and score here before half they don't get the ball after the half the way that this offense is working on the other side of the field they need to keep pace gets rid of it Tinnell Ellerbe was in ottoman hanging onto it before he got rid of the football you talked earlier about the Arizona Cardinals being the het most heavies blitzing team in football whoa these guys aren't far behind Dennis Allen's group is I think third and league in a number of pressures that they bring in you get into minute situations you know that the offense is trying to complete short pass to keep things going I like the call to bring some pressure on the quarterback to from the 44 yard line of the Saints catch sock carsick I hesitate then see that Nelson was open but incomplete it's now third down carson palmer's numbers 12 out of 18 at a tough hit on Carson he took the hit but on the outside there BW Webb who was covering JJ Nelson there took a chance and tried to jump the play but it left JD Nelson wide open just Carson Palmer couldn't improvise well enough to get him a football that was rookie Sheldon Rankin's the first runner of the Saints I love what offenses do this they've reduced the formation and in John Brown is right here it just runs an out reduce it to expand u BW Webb plays it wrong because he's inside technique there he should be outside of John Brown preventing that throw right there on third long first down for the Cardinals good execution Brown only had one catch in the last four games he has two today over the head of Larry Fitzgerald and a flag down personal foul roughing the passer number 94 defense 15yard penalty automatic first down Cameron Jordan called for the penalty and it's a big one that moves the team closer 15 yards in field goal range cam George right there watch him as he gets as he approaches the quarterback here is working on her Watford pushes him right back into the quarterback but you see at the end his head kind of leaning towards Carson that's where that penalty came to go in two timeouts st. Gresham had his back turned on the quay and Krueger was chasing down Carson Palmer there's Dennis Allen first year as the fulltime defensive coordinator the man in charge of the Saints defense and they've been better improved they've been better with some bodies down you know Kenny Vaccaro suspended still using that three safety look it's helped his defense in the last couple of weeks it's inside the 10yard line Cardinals using a timeout though at 1:00 remaining with 45 seconds before the half fit throw there by Carson Palmer I mean me her Robertson was really close to making a play on this football but found his most reliable receiver Larry Fitzgerald sends up a nice third short here so they're rated to where Carson Palmer previously had called Michael Floyd the X Factor and now of course he's an X Cardinal as a factor and some players upset about the way he was released Carson's got a chance here third one still have a timeout you can play the ball into the middle finger throw it anywhere really and then you have your opportunities after this to take shots at the end zone but it's important if they get a first down here well they needed to find some other xfactor and if you're gonna bring the whole out pressure you're just cleaning it up for your quarterback and you'll see this picture right here JJ Nelson you'll see him right here just running he's got that same matchup on Vaughn Bell and look at all this grass and he has to work with because they're playing mantoman coverage throws a little behind but JJ nelson beats 'm by so much it's an easy touchdown for arizona good drive right before the half to get back some points on this Saints team good fans cheering dad so despite the defensive strategy both of these veteran quarterbacks able to use the time before the half to march their teams downfield and for changing shoes before John Brown JD Nelson had some catches on that tribe that's only his second touchdown of this season and he was right on heavily last year when the Cardinals went to the playoffs here's Carson again got pressure in his face and i JJ Nelson just its distance on Bell to the corner of the endzone great throw great catch really really important drive for Arizona moving down the field we mentioned Nelson coming into the game his last three touches had been four touchdowns he has three catches today for a touchdown I'd say that's making up taking advantage of your opportunity for JJ Nelson he's going to give a lot of them here in the last couple of weeks of the season and a correction on Brown helping them to get down field with Nelson in the end zone but you made the point we talked without Michael Floyd somebody else had to step up and receiver and so far those two have well you know what Larry Fitzgerald is gonna be he's gonna be the intermediate catch underneath get all the dirty yardage blocking the run game somebody has got to be able to be a presence down the football field and gotta be JJ Nelson or John Brown it's up across the 23 yard line for the st. offense will take over let's check and see what's coming up at the VESA halftime report coming up on the visa halftime the Patriots and Broncos put on the show in Denver and two AFC West folks battled it out the Raiders visit the Chargers get your popcorn ready it's all coming up on the visa halftime already there a card game wait yo ease up the popcorn ready when Carson Palmer and drew brees are in a game already 44 combined first half points three touchdowns for Brees get that falling to the ground Saints have one timeout clock continuing to run usually yeah you see a lot of urgency out of a team out of this team they like to try to steal points it in a half I don't think they have enough time here with 18 seconds to get them to do it today no good Cooper she went out of bounds but it's third down and eight seconds remain the noobs gonna be an explosive off offensive football game today I think both coaches came into this week you know with the slight chance they may might make the playoffs but you got nothing to lose it in fact a couple of both coaches told us whatever you got the bottom of your PlayBook bring it out and I think we've seen a lot of that today some plays and some formations that I haven't seen on film with these guys are emerging today and there's cadet across the 43 and one second and it should make for an interesting second half and very little to play for except for the being a professional and it's a football game it's an opportunity to see some young guys I think and it's gonna think we're in for a good second half Chris we've already seen two big touchdown plays Brandon cooks from Drew Brees Peleus Campbell and a fumble return for a touchdown Kerwin Williams running in for a touch out of the moments ago the JD Nelson touchdown catch from Carson Palmer and Larry Fitzgerald those back teeth to play a little defensive back Hail Mary give campbell of six christmas present he gifted in the senate he's the guy who said these are the games that define your character i'd say his character and onfield play is pretty good at the half the saints lead at twenty four to twenty let's have the los angeles for the visa halftime report saints with a four point lead getting ready to receive the kick of the cardinals a quick moment to check our firsthalf highlights brought to you by head and shoulders a lot of big plays Carwin Williams running in for a touchdown cadet reaching across the goal line Elias Campbell with a 53yard fumble returned for a touchdown Brandon cooks with a couple of longrange scores from Drew Brees who has three first half touchdown passes of the jet Jay Nelson pulling one in from Carson Palmer those are the first half moments brought to you by head and shoulders drew brees getting loose he will turn 38 years old on January 15th Carson Palmer recently turning 37 years old though there's the youthful receiver Brandin cooks has lit up the scoreboard for the Saints kicking wolves continue for Chandler Catanzaro kicking off to start the second half driving this game show Florence should be an exciting second half I don't we talked about the Saints statistically top ranked offense Rodney against the Cardinals the top ranked defense in the NFL the Cardinals today they'd like to hold on to that number one ranking tough challenge with a responsive Drew Brees I think there's been some questions answered today whether or not true Brees could throw a touchdown pass he can if you throw three of them today and you look at the Arizona Cardinals defense and yes statistically they're the number one team in the league but they have given up their share of big plays and when their backs are against the wall Chris I've noticed this all year long they they haven't been able to make the gamechanging type play it's one of the reasons why they are mired in mediocrity this year and if they're able to make some plays here Chris a moment ago you mentioned Chandler ca\u00f1izares kicking woes for the Cardinals well Bruce Arians pulled him aside at halftime tried to settle him down told him just do your job you know ba told me it's so important to get him comfortable because he feels like the way this game is going it'll likely come down to a field goal in the end Chris I thank you very much right now a four point difference the Saints have been scoring an average of twenty 7.5 points a game they've been giving up at that point of twenty seven points a game that's the close games they've been involved in and in the air for Michael Thomas who made a turn directly to receivers in the area and falling incomplete Brees the most accurate passer in NFL history and this season ratha he's over 70 percent completion rate yeah even with that 61 percent completion last week still very efficient throwing the football he's especially good on third down this team does a good job protecting him in these situations and I gotta imagine Arizona's gonna pressure him soon and Peterson is on cooks passes low but caught by Willie sneak short of the first down at the 30 yard line so something you addressed that Patrick Peterson might have been on Michael Thomas well this time he was on cooks after he that's such a big first half well it's interesting in this type of game when you have two receivers cooks and Michael Thomas who present problems who do you put your best guy on and I've seen today him be on both guys second half I'm gonna keep an eye and see if he's gonna follow around ten on those crucial third down situations because lightness Arizona defense up today first punt of the game for Thomas more status Patrick Peterson watches it bounce and head out of bounds a special edition of the NFL on Fox on Christmas Eve to the Fox NFL kickoff show America's number one pregame show and among all the action America's game of the week the Vikings and Packers things have tightened up in that division with the Green Bay win and the Detroit loss bucks will be flying the Saints in New Orleans and the Cardinals will be up in Seattle for the Seahawks is one the West we hope you tune in oh great holiday season nice outfit kid loved it braver than I am three running backs are in course you know David Johnson splits as a receiver but Kerwin Williams Andre Ellington and David Johnson from the 40yard line great field position receivers Neto Johnson and Ellington so only Williams open up and go to the recesses of your PlayBook you do a lot of window dressing on this play just to turn around and hand the ball hold hand the ball off David Johnson out to the bottom you get this motion here but watch the gap that opens right there I'm sorry on the other side of that you're of Boggs there and big gas play for kerbin Williams had a big bang today now the Wildcat he's taking the snap to David Johnson created that's the very first time that we've seen Karen Williams give the ball up place selfishly gave the ball to David Johnson yes this is now the fifth or sixth time that we've seen this in the past two weeks and gives the ball to David Johnson I love putting you know when your offenses when you're searching for answers a little bit and they were definitely searching for answers last week put the pasta at quarterback let him make a decision they pick up some nice yards on first down to do something he's first career touchdown came against the Saints it was on a touchdown reception see at a twopoint conversion last week still holding on those 15 total touchdowns and if you're wondering about his yardage output today he only has 51 yards now what does he need one more two more games to get the alltime record for most number of hundred yard games to start a year total scrimmage yards obviously at 13 and Counting here with sterling more with excellent company great conference by Sterling more on the vet Larry Fitzgerald here and they tried to do a little switch route with Larry and David Johnson but sterling Moore is all over that play good job by this defense getting off on third down there Matt while add it to the team ready to punt also the holder if you tuned in a little bit late errors word is back for the Saints and right out the 11yard line the Saints offense will take over with a four point lead here in the third quarter today's game is sponsored by Southwest yes the little beard with nothing to hide that's transparency Aaron Arizona some great golf cars is nearby we got to play last night I think your ball still in there meanwhile the loser of this game will be eliminated from the playoff picture and the Falcons leading 28:13 at home against the 49ers if they win it eliminates the Saints chances as Mark Ingram gets up across the 16 and a half yard line haven't seen a lot of Mike Perry Mark Ingram here in the second quarter he came out hot with those seven eight carries to start the football game see if they get back to trying to manage this game with the running game a little bit a little bit here came in with an average of just over five it carries averaging almost six of carry in today's game on nine carries his Brees Michael Thomas it looks like there wherever Patrick Peterson goes they're throwing on the other side well he doesn't usually get a lot of a lot of targets per game and you know he's he's a lock down kind of guy now he does a lot of things well for this defense allows the other guys these other ten guys to play a little free or mean not a lot of corners in this league can do what he does at corner but it definitely opens up the PlayBook for their defensive coordinator Patrick Peters have started every game since being drafted in that opening round in 2011 for this cargo team just great timing on this row catch great route by Michael Thomas and that's the one thing that impresses me about Michael Thomas is a rookie just the precision that he works with his quarterback he works at it in practice he tell you he's a professional you'll see many young guys to have type of impact in their first year that he's had with this Saints offense as he gets lined up wrong I'm second one the pitch to Ingram mentioned breeze over 200 passing yards high percentage of nineteen out of twenty five cooks with four catches two of those four touchdowns they have a injured player at his Marcus Cooper for the Cardinals last week he injured is back we'll see what they're checking on here number 26 the rookie from Texas A&amp;M trapped in the third round he'll come in for Marcus Cooper who went to the locker room and first round a Robert Kim D Chi from Mississippi has come in on the defensive line for the Cardinals Willie Sneed catches and hits out of bounds right near the first down marker the Cardinals really haven't gotten a lot out of there a lot of solid production from their draft this year compete she's been inactive almost every game and Bruce Aaron to tell you that he just hasn't done enough to show that he deserves to play great talent measurables when you look at the kid but Cathy Fiola Purdue's got to be able to be a pro every single day and these two guys time and goodwill you know what they need to get out of the kid he hasn't quite shown again going up for the first down for the Saints 48 yard line the tight end force Josh Hill was put on the injured list so he's the backup to Coby Fleener and John Phillips has been around long time it's football player at a University of Virginia you mentioned that because I think you went there I know somebody that's right but he's been with the Cowboys the Chargers the Broncos don't see him much as a pass receiver he is primarily the blocker but yes with Hill going the I are a couple of weeks ago he's taking on a much bigger role in this offense negative nine Tim Hightower gets the first down inside the 40yard line as Larry Fitzgerald I said I can't tell you how happy I am having been a teammate of his and appreciated the story of Hightower what he's worked through drafted by the Cardinals injuries out of football everybody we talked to on the Cardinals staff or your team that was here with him and nothing but glowing things to say about him happy that he's back where he is now playing football Reeves for Cookson it's incomplete Hightower called Larry Fitzgerald a mentor as many players do who have come through and there's a saint player injured at the 45yard line Sania kalamata who has moved around on that offensive line to help out today's game is sponsored by Verizon it's always a great gift on Verizon some great sites in it around Arizona and enjoying a game with a roof open temperature get up in the high 60s little cool for this part of the country but plenty of sunshine Kalamata is Tim Toledo comes in he helped her set her last week when max Unger was hurt under playing today and Ingram carrying and for his career more than 4,000 yards a specialist in the history of the New Orleans Saints we mentioned McAllister the last thousand euro aggression for a season short Rodgers are very popular former LSU start Dalton Hilliard and the Heisman Trophy winner Mark Ingram over 4000 third down and ten from just inside the Arizona 40 breathe some cooks he has a first down at the 25yard line I don't know that Peterson was on him that time the way they lined up they were playing zone comforts here on the back end and again James Spector decides to throw a pressure at this Saints offense it puts 36 you'll see DJ swear injure come into your screen late having to cover Brandon cooks and he's just doesn't have the speed to keep up with him that injury to marques Cooper and Riza tacking that Mark Ingram points off it the 21 is shut down let's get a game break with charissa Thompson and check in again Karissa thanks Chris earlier today after losing 2120 in a heartbreaking loss to the Texans at losing their ninth straight game Gus Bradley fired as the head coach of the Jags his record in Jacksonville 14 and 48 Chris Rondon all right a popular guy but Bradley fired the second coach this year Jeff Fisher fire prior to the Rams and their loss on Thursday night to Seattle did he know Willie Sneed had his hands on it and Michael Thomas was back there as well there was some confusion in the backfield here with the Arizona Cardinals trying to decide where they were going to get lined up and true Brees tries to throw this over the head of CO Moore who winds up on a wide receiver here Willie Sneed I mean that looks like a catch to me if Sean Payton wants to challenge that and it looks like we're gonna get a challenge that looks like he held on to it went to the ground in the end zone was touched it would be down for a touchdown I don't see any part of that football touched the ground and when he's on his back you'll see it right here when he is on his back this ball is secured I think this is a touchdown hand under the ball right there you see rolled incomplete but you saw what we saw the officials will take a closer look on the challenge today's game is sponsored by Samsung paint turn your phone into your wallet ruled incomplete Snee thought he had it challenged by Sean Payton in the endzone Carl Jeffers and Mike Pereira was watching along with us our rules analyst at the Fox Network Center in Los Angeles Mike yeah and I agree with letting this stand although the ball didn't initially come out when he first hit the ground but as he started to roll over it looks like it gets pulled away from him and you lose sight of the ball that's the key so if they lost sight of the ball at that point you've got to leave it as a stand if that was ruled a touchdown you'd think they would have left it that way absolutely okay that's all we want to clarify they took a closer look thank you Mike Pereira third down five threes incomplete inside the 15 Thomas sliding but couldn't hold it I guess the argument in that to run is if you have possession and you're down in the end zone but you got to carry through that element of time and hold on to the ball yeah we won't try to put you through the the minutia that is the definition of a catch it takes forever for us to figure it out I'm glad Mike Prayer agree with the call because I really didn't know where to go I thought he had caught it but you do have to possess it when you're going to the ground all the way through the catch and that's why they call them incomplete a great effort anyway in a nice defensive play and a rip the ball out of there will Lutz from 39 yards and the kick is up through the Saints we'll expand their lead by seven Patrick Peterson all in a lather over a play that looked like he was either held or a facemask that we'll take a look Darryl Tapp nothing was called on the field goal that was good from will watts who's ready to kick off after a touchdown ruled incomplete challenged and not overturned Saints though with a 2720 lead as you see that total yards piled up by these offenses once it's true all the way up there the 40 yard line let's go back Ronde does he have a legitimate argument on this field goal he's talking to the official with Darryl Tapp walking against Peterson I think he talked to every single official on the field he's right here in your screen but watch Darryl Tapp gets his facemask that's not what he's groping about it's that I think he has a legitimate case for being held and he went right to your official Carl Jeffers Jeffers right after the play and he is fired up man I agree with him look at him who wants to listen to me I was held something that's not reviewable just in case you were wondering 35 yard return sets up the Cardinals in good shape trailing by seven there's JJ Nelson he's out of bounds around midfield he has the touchdown catch before the half on an impressive drive by Carson Palmer and this Arizona office well they do this all the time we mentioned it earlier in the game this just pick up and throw the football when the box count is it rain and I think the Saints were trying to run a little bit of a invert cover to safety go to the flat the in the corner back off to play the half field Carson Palmer recognizes it picks up those at the JJ Nelson first down Saints have done a good job against the run today and David Joseph we're in trouble for david johnson who makes the catch at the 26yard line great catch by david johnson but i'm telling you what this is an impossibly good play by carson palmer watch him come out of this play fake and roman harper's right in his face in an improvisation by carson palmer finding david johnson running down the field against craig Robertson nice play yeah by Josh said yet at 11year veteran and Harper chasing a 14year veteran Ian Palmer who got it away to the 25 year old David Johnson getting closer to that hundred yard scrimmage mark for this game he's just gonna do it you can't populate the box like this and not have somebody close to the line of scrimmage Carson Palmer is no dummy he's been around for a long time he understands what you're trying to do to him he will take that nine yard gain you know over turnaround handing the ball to his running back and let him hit his head on a wall after an 8 yard pickup flag flies Johnson looking for somewhere to go he does get the first down to the 13th let's check the flag offside number 48 defense penalties decline results of the play first down well David Johnson he's such a good job making something out of nothing this play is designed to go to the left but look at the two footed jump cut back into it tiny little hole picks up two or three yards it goes unnoticed on the stat sheet really that three yard carry but what a big play to get that first down by closer to a cardinal milestone for total scrimmage yards he's at 81 for this game Carson Palmer sterling more on the coverage team Ville s the target the rookie tight end from Monmouth College pass interference well this is tough duty for sterling more he's only 510 and the tight end he's covering valas six six five you have to see it right through through here the play and as this ball was delivered he's got to try to go through the big guy to make a play and he pulls on the back of his jersey to get to the other side of his shoulder and that is a good call by that official the was activated from the practice squad back in October David Johnson on first and goal Meharry Oh touchdown 16 touchdowns this year for jutsu while assuming we get a converted extra point here what a nice drive by the Arizona Cardinals to tie this football game just methodical doing all the right things I like the way that they relied on the running game here David Johnson bringing his influence to bear on this drive as a receiver and as a runner and if Chandler Catanzaro can convert here he's missed four extra points this year remember this is a 33 yard kick with Matt while as the holder and they're just confirming the scoring playing the booth wants to review it rule the touchdown on the field and want to make sure that that is accurate that's the picture they get there's not enough anything in there to to say that he did not score but David Johnson showing that he has great power in his legs and he got some good blocking up front a tireless worker yeah watch out watch your left guard my guy body right here body you potty I'm sorry just what he does the Craig Robertson right here clears the lane and in david johnson tumbles in for the touchdown you planted one of the few linemen on the cardinal offensive line currently that's been two Pro Bowls member the former 49er in Johnson whether he's running or receiving they're just acting as a decoy for Bruce Arians he's done a little bit of everything today Johnson has he seen them numerous times line up on the outside as a receiver you know given Kerwin Williams some opportunities to run the football I like the variety two yard run for David Johnson 12 rushing touchdowns to go with four touchdown catches this season and moving in on the franchise record of John David crow while the whole Catanzaro after Carson Palmer chatted with him before the half try to calm him down for the time 27h Cardinals and saints look at the relief on his face that was a nicely struck ball though and as Jin hail reported at half you never know he might be needed at some point in this game to win it with a field goal the third annual are truly sportsmanship award honors Senate Bell players who exemplify outstanding sportsmanship on the field and earlier this week of panel of NFL legends selected these eight finalists the winner announced at the NFL honors award show it's the night before Super Bowl 51 that's February 4th the Super Bowl you'll see on Fox from Houston Texas and Larry Fitzgerald the winner of that award back in 2014 continues to spread goodwill among teammates and competitors your numerous Christmas references have not gone unnoticed on me today I already dress this up people get presents people see but a better mood except when you're traveling but that's another story if you could find more just get on the aisle Catanzaro to kickoff into the endzone well you know it's the time of year when not only the holiday season veteran quarterbacks like Aaron Rodgers and Eli Manning Ben Roethlisberger yeah do things for their teams Carson Palmer Drew Brees are doing that today there's a nurse I mean really if you're watching this football game you're watching it for the love of football and hoping upon ho but maybe Santa brings you a play gift that you're looking for a good football game we've got a great football game 27 points by each team here I think I think I had it at 48 I think our producer director downstairs the only one that thought this would be a highexplosive game and it's shown just that both quarterbacks playing well should be a fun last 18 minutes or so this football game breeze comes out throwing wide open as Willie Snead quickly up to the 44 yard line the pace of the Saints offense has been terrific all afternoon it really has been and they're getting a ton of zone coverage from the Arizona Cardinals and you'll see it watch Tyrann Mathieu and CEO Moore here just dropped this coverage there's nobody there look how wide open he is and this defense relies a lot on single mantoman carpets bringing pressure haven't seen much of it today and I got to believe it's because there's so many receiving options on this Saints offense Brees over 250 passing yards to go with the three touchdowns the rookie Michael Thomas in motion to the top of your screen Tim Hightower carrying for New Orleans we talked about the pace Chris and what helps them what's help the pace of this office it is the running game I mean they've turned around and hand the ball off now 22 times and that's uncharacteristic of them of late and I like when they get into this type of balance because it opens up plaques and pass I've said it numerous times a day it keeps the change where they're supposed to be and I think you're seeing the results of effective offense surging forward physical that's the part you've talked about that that's six three framin is over 215 pounds oh you see up stand next to him on the sidelines he looks skinny but he has great physicality if he's playing at the line of scrimmage he's got great strong hands good upper body watch what he does to Williams here pushes him off that nice little touch at the top of his route to create some space and then this always is an asset when you fight for those extra yards for the New Orleans Saints good football players they stole one here in the second round of the draft to get him out of Ohio State and Williams working on him because of the Cooper injury we seen Patrick Peterson on cooks after a pickup of 12 fries it's down to the 37 yard line siren Matthew knocking him down I guess that shoulders okay what Tyron we haven't talked a lot about him you know he had the knee injury that I thought was severely limiting him early in the football season he didn't look like the same player he's a little timid coming into tackles I'm obviously wary about reentering that knee and then the shoulder but today he looks healthy and maybe the weeks office served him like they should and got him back to playing at 100% Willie slinging he's completed passes to nine different receivers today that's the sixth catch for Snead which leads all receivers degrees always talks about rather mean it's like ad nauseam when he talks about rhythm in the past last couple of throws I've seen where he's sitting his back football's coming out receivers are getting open and that's that's what he that's it he is that's why he's a 71 percent completion guy this season because of that I got a third and short here I expect turn around hand his ball off the marker and get this first down all they need is a yard he's gonna throw NASA's by Ingram down the sideline spotted all the way around the 15yard line of the Cardinals it off throw until in same thing right well Brees will take take the yardage take you heard it but what you get here is a you get a nice little pick route by Brandon cooks on the linebacker and coverage you've seen it at least three times today the design of this type of play it's been different players but Sean Payton has drawn up some really good plays on third down for his offense Ingram second catch of the day to go with more than 60 yards rushing so he's doing his best David Johnson version for the Saints who are on the move at the end of three quarters in Arizona University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale Arizona with robbed a barber Chris Myers nice to have you watching the NFL on Fox David Johnson's scoring his 29th career touchdown and this is xxx game and we are tied but the Saints trying to respond with a first and ten at the 15 of New Orleans to open the fourth quarter breathe for khun his fullback a few yards Chandler Jones going over to make the play for Arizona breeze came in along with Carson Palmer each of them averaging more than 40 pass attempts a game breezes thrown 37 times today just a few yards shy of 300 they lost a couple on that play open short shower goes out of bounds inside the 15 while Brandon cooks the Cardinals defense has cooled him off just a bit after the first half either yeah I haven't seen any target storm and so far in the second half and third down situation you get down here a lot of coaches like to bring pressure zero pressures make the quarterback get the hand out get the ball out of his hands quick and come up and make a tackle SEAL team spectre decides to do to this offense right here a young Saints fan anticipating a blitz from the Cardinals instead they only rushed to Tim but short of the first down again Tom Payton's upset because they had the Arizona Cardinals kind of scrambling to get lined up but the plate wasn't snapped fast enough but Arizona does a good job rallying to make a tackle here the pivot route called Co more that's tough for a linebacker to deal with now luckily he's got Chandler Jones in the flat there to come make a tackle for him will what's the rookie kicker he's been good from 37 and 39 today this will be a 25 yard field goal he gives the Saints the lead with a flag down somebody may have moved here on the Saints or do we have an offside Arizona offside Arizona oh that's killer yeah that'll give him a first down it's first down I actually thought this was a false start on the on the wing here but the indication that we see on the field is that this is going to be an encroachment penalty and this is just inexcusable offside defense number 28 results in a first down that's on Justin Bethel this is Justin Bethel right here at the end Elias scrimmage in he saw the wing back kind of moved there but the initial call there was that he was in the neutral zone before that false start by the wing Wow yeah well that's a first down even there wasn't even the five yards but half the distance enough to spot it at the 4 yard line both coaches frustrated by now Sean Payton with three off the board a chance to get six or seven on first and goal extra lineman Landon Turner Tim Hightower the football Tim Hightower the touchdown against the team that drafted him and the Saints had the lead in the fourth quarter well no need to get cute down here you just turn around and hand it off to Tim Hightower he is gonna get another great block by his tight in watch John Phillips he's gonna come in motion it's a guy in motion across the formation here but watch the block that he gets inside here on Chandler Jones and that's exactly where that ball runs off his button for the endzone for a touchdown New Orleans on for the extra point is will Lutz who had the field goal but then the penalty he gave Sean Payton a chance and Hightower punches it in a 33yard extra point it's good a 7point Saints lead Tim Heights how a lot of big runs for the Cardinals over the years this time he scores for the Saints in Arizona today's game is sponsored by the allnew 2017 Ford Super Duty this is the next level Hightower got the touchdown but Drew Brees his ninth 300 yard gamed this season adding on to his NFL record a hundred five 300yard passing games the most in the history of the NFL and working things over on that Microsoft Surface as less kicks off and Britton golden will down it till the 25yard line mentioned David Johnson moments ago there's a number of milestones he's chasing scrimmage yards in a season you see how he stacks up with the great Ottis Anderson Anderson held that franchise scrimmage yards in a single season it's rookie year 79 rush for over 1600 head over 300 receiving and was the 1979 Rookie of the Year David Johnson in his second year from Northern Iowa putting up impressive numbers this year as Kerwin williams opens in the backfield david johnson a receiver carson palmer and oakland is written golden who had his first career touchdown last week in Miami when he also played a little defensive back out of necessity Britton golden has done a lot for this football team here of late and asking Larry Johnson about you know Britt and what he can do for this team he says his confidence is soaring right now we did see a play safety last week he's down in numbers but he has an opportunity again just like some of these other young receivers to make a mark here late in the season now that Michael Floyd is no longer on this football team his first catch of today has been death of 19 Carson Palmer is over 200 yards passing first down inside the 45 of New Orleans got a game break with Curt Menefee well Matson for the team that scores the most points per game against the women I love the most is going about like he would expect Devonta Freeman green rushing touchdown 139 yards Atlanta all over the Niners 38:13 right now in the fourth quarter Chris Ronde thanks Curt and that would eliminate an Atlanta win would eliminate the Santa Saints from any playoff hopes is going team in the league at night of the Saints next in line David Johnson he's got a cardinal first I was like a freak this trick shifting gears this guy's good 13yard pickup I swear he does so many things he gets a good block by his left right guard right there but it's the breaking that tackles the jump cutting the guy's never not motioned his feet are always moving he's impossible to get a square hit on which is very hard to say against a guy that's that big touches on the day was only about 17 yards away before this drive at getting his seculars be over a hundred hundred yards so he does get it I mean the guy is special player contends to show it week in and week out first 14 games to start the season of 100 yards or more from scrimmage and he doesn't look Schmucker moving past Edgerrin James Janssen with 11 carries also does four catches he's coming off a big week seasonhigh number of catches against the Dolphins well not only Kenny running catch she can block watch him come across the formation here and give Carson Palmer just enough time to get rid of his football it's a complete player every down back 1st 2nd 3rd down he could be out there he is a first down Carson Palmer completes JJ Nelson turns the corner gets near another first down JJ Nelson has awesome acceleration doesn't he this ball is a little 4 or 5 yard completion but once he gets this ball in his hands we saw it on his reverse touchdown and our cameraman jump good job stay in there stay in the fight and what he said and there in Pierce in the festive mood he wears that hat yearround though that's what people don't realize them it's an issue but we we still put up with them great work there at the earth Nelsons only 160 pounds and he picked up hate on that catching terror the Johnson first out of David Johnson touchdown another great drive by the Arizona Cardinals here great balance again in the run game in the pass game I don't know that I've seen carson palmer look this good in a while he's getting some good protection but his runner is taking care of him right here watch the run to the left side here and talked about this change on the offensive line but larry fitzgerald number 11 in your screen you know who he is the block on Vaughn Bell forces that play down inside gives David Johnson just enough room to squeeze in there for the touchdown yeah now 17 touchdowns this season tying John David Crowe for the franchise Cardinals record two today and the extra point Cardinal fans holding their breath it's a tie 3434 some fantasy like numbers being thrown up here in Arizona David Johnson adding to his fantasy season for Bruce Arians teammates congratulating David Johnston breaking three records on one drive that's that's stuff to do good job young man it's a milestone moment and it's nice to have your teammates sharing it and he's a very unselfish player for as much as he plays on the field every down he pointed out his blocking to go along with these statistical numbers and he's put up this will be a touchback so Saints come out to the 25yard line just under nine minutes to go after a impressive drive carson palmer set it up and david johnson finished it off today's game is sponsored by the new film seen in theaters this wednesday smallscreen stadiumsized content you could watch live local sunday games right out your smartphone with NFL mobile wherever you go the NFL is with you to watch the team the games you want this is a good one regardless of the standings two veteran quarterback ssin tied at 34 it's a good one if you despise defense and neither one of these defenses are showed up it's a good one if you're a fantasy player it's probably some good fantasy numbers being made here in this game Monica offensive production in his football game but to the point I was making the defense on either side of the ball that Arizona had comes in number one yardage wise that hasn't shown up the Saints have been playing better on defense that hasn't shown up he's been an offensive explosion today trick wiedersehen edge on Brandon cooks who's been statistically number one defense usually figure defense wins out you hear all that but the offenses have dominated today they really have Drew Brees has been excellent delivering the football he's only got 19 completions today and talked early in the game about the balance on offense running and throwing the football it's been there even though it's skewed 4324 in play selection it done just enough of turnaround and handed a ball off to make this a manageable game for reason company bucks catch made on the sideline with Peterson covering and a first down for the Saints nice little play here he's call this a speed out and it's all about timing you got your best timing delivery quarterback out there hold on they're getting ready to go to the line here it was ruled to catch on the field here comes challenge from Bruce Arians when we go back and look at it we'll have to see if Brandon cooks got that left foot down I saw the right one when he had possession but I'm not sure that he got that upper down of a catch we'll review the play rule the catch on the field Bruce Arians is old for three in challenges this year we'll have a closer look at this one it was close ruled a catch challenge let's listen to our referee Karla Jefferson all coaches losing their challenges what do you think Rhonda well there's a couple of pictures that I was looking up here and got him look at his left foot I don't think it touched the ground right there but it's very tough to see if it did and I don't know that there's enough evidence to overturn and as we've talked about numerous times this year if it's close to play the call you what they make on the field usually stands there's another thing when I was looking at this plane is really kind of indicative of what's going on on Arizona's defense all day Patrick Peterson weren't even ready for the snap so he's a little bit of a position breeze with time and wide open who's branded courts Thomas gives him a block downfield they gets inside the 17 yard line plenty of protection for drew brees well Brandon cooks right here and again a lot of zone coverage by Arizona look nobody's there I ask myself a lot of times when I'm watching film how does a guy get that wide open I don't know how Brandon cooks who is scorching this defense today is that wide open a pickup of 36 yards and that's a career best for cooks in terms of receiving yards 186 his careerhigh and catches his 10 that has got a couple of long touchdowns in this one Mark Ingram Brandon cooks with Michael Thomas back on the other side has been able to find room to run and Brees has been able to connect with them cut the long touchdown passes and in clutch situations Peterson has covered a more in the second half but now they're finding cook talked about their explosive plays more plays over 20 yards any team in football and against the number one defense today they are just exploiting them great performance by cooks what's coming breeze Willie Snead his a touch of the game inside the five first and goal Saints this guy does wonders in the slot for this football team doesn't he every time we have a New Orleans Saints game at some point he's gonna be a factor and I love the way he stemmed that round he moved into the defender Patrick Peterson in with making him believe that he was going to go across the field stemmed it up the field breaking out and then nice completion and stemming I mean not going straight he moved and then up then out straight route by Willie Smith thank you for clarifying you're welcome Chris Myers mark big role in the backfield Brees for a fourth touchdown pass today Michael Thomas the Saints core what a cat what it can't a lot of credit to this throw that Michael Thomas just climbs a ladder Williams this touchdown he's special he is really special more more I watched him the more more impressed with them mantoman comforts on the outside oneonone my guy is better than your guy touchdown Saints his eighth touchdown of this his rookie season and I was gonna say coming back Ronde after missing last week has got a quiet number of catches but he showed up big there looked like that San Diego touchdown that got those Saints their first win of the year as they are waiting for confirmation on the scoring line give us the thumb come on that's a touchdown it's a thumbs up Saints it done well point out West this year winning in San Diego winning out in San Francisco and now leading in Arizona since the extra point and a flag down another encouragement penalty I mean these are little fiveyard penalty is obviously we saw the one that led to a touchdown or an opportunity to go for a touchdown earlier but a little quick trigger by just at Bethel I believe who it was again he's right there in the line of scrimmage and he's very good at this he's awesome special teams player but he is itching a little too much right now and that's I think it's third one on the day a 75yard Drive a quick response and Michael Thomas talked about finger yoga hand yoga and he uses that to hang on to the football how about a bounceback game for Brees three over 370 yards four touchdowns has not thrown an interception and his team is winning they're giving him clean looks is is what's happening you know when they get these sort yardage situations and outs down the goal line he has mantoman it's easy for him to make that throw now the Saints even though they can't win the division if Atlanta holds on and wins it eliminates them from the NFC South Division title but they would have a miniscule wildcard opportunity depending on some of the other scenarios so we don't want to rule that out but the loser of this game again is officially eliminated from playoff contention two games to go in the regular season after this what's four golden who will down it and out to the 25yard line comes the Arizona offense with Carson Palmer leading the way well I always like to look at these scenarios you can mix it match but the Giants impressive winning they were the only team to beat the Cowboys twice what do you think of that Tampa Bay Dallas game tonight in terms of the wild card picture without being a homer I think that Tampa Bay has a shot you could be a hole I think they have a shot they're playing good on defense and you have a good quarterback and Jameis Winston one of the best receivers and Mike Evans so yeah they got a chance and they Ellis has been down a little so rich kids can play on Monday night and Green Bay keeps winning to keep heat on the Lions who lost today here comes a fly and see web P W web hopping up and down what did I do conference was the Paul yeah debate I think I think this is going to be a they might consider picking this up but the penalty I think was thrown for contact having played the position you have great insight I have great sympathy that's good though call right let him play a little bit there that is a fantastic no call let them play and by the way that Michael Thomas touchdown catch his ain't that since the Saints rookie record the Donte Stallworth Marques Colston rookie record was seven four receivers that's what has the Nelson good coverage by Kent Crawley there's happened to play the Nickelback Delvin Breaux we talked earlier is out so BW Webb is playing the nickel inside and gives Crawley a chance to get some game reps third long here for Arizona being five minutes and I guess they have time to punt but and get the pan try to get the football back but they haven't stopped to Gries at all may be interesting to see what they decision Bruce Arians makes it they don't get a first down here do it first this is gonna be a take away for the Saints defense and a lot of credit here one official he's just trying to move players away to sort out what happened well brick golden is on the ground because he took a shot but it was a great play by Nick Fairley chasing down this screen to make this tackle Shh football that clear clearly a turnover watch 90 coming to your screen right here Nick Fairley to make this tackle he has the ball there but when he gets hit BAM ball comes out that's a fumble and Ken Crawley recovering you always talk about these big deal I'm and what they do with the line of scrimmage but chasin screens down is their job and Nick Fairley even though he's not gonna get credit with the fumble is the reason the Saints have the football back we'll check on the Brent golden injury he's helped to the sideline but the Saints take over on the takeaway Nick Fairley who came over from the Rams former firstround pick of the Lions with the big fumble cost just chasing the ball down man just big guys aren't necessarily known to do this but when you get a screen slip screen right that having the ability to recognize it turn around and chase the ball allows you to make a play if he's not there I think brick golden kind of splits that defense it is running but he is the key to stopping that play you get the hit somebody else calls the fumble turnover Saints they have the ball and are in control Phil Johnson defensive line coach appreciating the effort frustrating moments golden helped over on the Cardinal sideline most combined points at a game this year in the NFL is 81 that was the Falcons and Panthers right now we're at 75 see what the Saints do at the 29 of Arizona Cardinal defense up against it here such trouble we had to get rid of it because of the rush from Tony Jefferson he was getting a lot of pressure here man Willie Sneed is wide open right here again confusion on the back end of the Arizona defense and if Drew Brees makes a little bit better throw or has just maybe a second more time that may have been a touchdown it already has four touchdown passes in the game over 370 yards through the air or breeze jim hightower we are at scored the touchdown moments ago important in Arizona gets a stop here I mean they have to allow a field goal opportunities try not to jump offsides in that case but I believe that Sean Payton in this offense will try to be careful with the football here they know they have this team right where they want them I won't be surprised they turn around a hand this ball off and take the field goal attempt chuckle a is Campbell who's been in on Brees a couple of times for sacks and he had the fumble return for a touchdown in the first half third down and eight let's come and Breeze in trouble when it goes down smothered at the 40count emitter let the way that's exactly why you don't drop back to pass here and there's a flag down as well personal foul roughing the quarterback oh boy this is tough man this is tough it's an allout blitz 54 is right here 50 ones right behind the goalposts running right unobstructed to the goal posed in I mean he hit the head he mentor is a tackler but it's Co more that hits the head of Drew Brees and that's where that call came in that's a tough one I know he's protected from helmet to helmet contact you see it right here but he's just trying to get into this play and I don't know that that's a foul man that I I don't I do not agree with that that was clear Michael Thomas touchdown a moment she goes inside the five that is such a big play in this football game for Arizona they had a sack put them well out of field goal range and we're gonna get the ball back and because of this judicious call here head to head helmet the helmet actually looks like he may even hit his shoulder pad it Bruce Arians has his a very very good point here being upset he's going to talk guarantee he's gonna start his press conference with that play after this game is over I'll remember an offside penalty on the field goal gave the Saints at first down look like the appropriate call and that pass is almost intercepted a lot of traffic around Coby Fleener there were five or six Cardinals that's got to be an interception I mean if you talk about a defense that his championship level and these guys are number one in the league one of these guys got to come down this football whether it's Mike Miller or whether it's Tyrann Mathieu intercept the football tips over throws or a DB secondaries best friend one of y'all catch that Patrick Peterson realized the missed opportunity we have a timeout by the Saints and Sean Payton this is third and one just over three and a half to play from inside the five yard line and at the head shake on that call by the officiating crew indicates how frustrated they are a recordsetting day career day for Brandon cooks Drew Brees four touchdowns david johnson sitting franchise records scrimmage records but the game on the line a sevenpoint Saints lien with a chance to get more after the timeout here comes Brees now John Coon is a guy they could use if he comes in Brandon Coleman who's the angular receiver breeze has kept on occasion Mark Ingram the back Mark Ingram the football he's got the first down third and short all day today started on the very first drive of the game this is what they're doing they're just putting their heavy people in put John Coon out in front of the runner and running a toss and this Arizona defense that's known for speed great lateral pressure has not done its job today marking or picks up another first down over 70 yards rushing for Ingram on 15 carries today tired Campbell on first and goal Saints they've piled up 475 yards of offense against the statistically topranked defense Tim Hightower touchdown this second of the day well I came into this game Chris into the redzone being the best or scoring the most touchdowns down here and it just continues today he gets a great block by the fullback Coon and then watched the puller number 73 Joey Evans right here going here and in Coon watch these two blocks on these two guys on your two linebackers and that can't get any easier walking into the end zone for Tim Hightower I'll do three and a half to play it's now a twotouchdown difference with the extra point from will Watson yes to total points the most combined points in an NFL game this year and for some reason Mark Ingram is upset maybe because he didn't get the score I don't I don't know I don't have a touchdown today even though he has run well his average is up almost 5 yards to carry he's upset you see him there's easy nobody can console him here when you're winning the game should you be if that is the reason for that mean a couple of weeks ago Brandon cooks with his issue was not did not catch a big catch a pass wasn't targeted he made them focal I mean in mark Ingram's upset somebody tell him he's winning Sean Payton realizes that what's going on in the back behind him here sometimes you your position coach or offensive coordinator can come over and calm the situation well you hate to be showing that on the sideline after a great scoring drivers sort score and driving a scoring drive we're actually the ones showing it with our cameras but people can see it it's happening Britton golden back out there on the 25yard line they'll take over on offense down now two touchdowns Jennifer Criss an emotional Tim Hightower on the sidelines right now you mentioned his history with the Arizona Cardinals how much he wanted this one he actually gave the pregame speech for the Saints in the locker room before this matchup he talked about perseverance and goodness he knows a lot about it after being out of the league for almost three years with that torn ACL and undiagnosed infection it was a speech that really hit home with this Saints squad and right now he is just living this moment up I don't know if it hit home with Mark Ingram because Ingram probably said I understand the return get a touchdown but Ingram probably thought he deserved a chance on the last carry in the meantime completed to John Brown that still is going to come down to and it's going to be controversial the capacity rustling the roughing the passer penalty on Drew Brees but its offense now situation down to scores they got to get going they got to move fast here see if they can get back into this football game I would imagine a score an onside kick and they have a chance it's good to see Mark Ingram working with each other this team that led the NFL in explosive plays last year doesn't anymore it's this catch the football you can't be any more wide open this throat she's not getting pretty better well that's just inexcusable I mean I I'm a fan of football as anybody else the ability to catch a ball wide open like that you got to be able to do that and Carson Palmer he's been exasperated by this all year you talked to Bruce Arians why haven't they've been the team that they were last year the number one thing he says out of his mouth every time receivers do not catch the football set those receivers needed to step up today that's it completely yeah they had that gone for a touchdown run it's a whole different game because then you're thinking you can kick it hold him with timeouts or the twominute warning missed opportunities this is a season of missed opportunities for the Arizona Cardinals and it's frustrating as a fan of football a team that was in the NFC Championship game last year got destroyed they thought that they would have a chip on their shoulder to come back and now they're down 14 and probably conversation altogether false start number 78 offense the Falcons did defeat the 49ers in Atlanta 41 to 13 leaders of the NFC South the Buccaneers playing the Cowboys and Sunday Night Football the Cardinals have been the same since that championship game blowout up in Carolina in fact this year they've only won backtoback games once their best stretch in October after two wins but tied Seattle bombur's throat a Fitzgerald to get something another five yards short of the first down well this guy is gonna come to work I know that Larry Fitzgerald whenever you need a play he's going to be the guy I would expect him fire cars and I target him right now on fourth down he does and Larry's got the first down and it was Fitzgerald this contract takes him through next year who said you know I wouldn't keep playing if I didn't think we have a chance to win Ariane's lives in football are tied together for the next year running during the twominute mark but a timeout by the Cardinals they'll have one remaining Larry Fitzgerald just continues to do it and he does so many things for this offense we say it over and over and over again he's moved to that Z receiver so he has the block and he saw it on on David Johnson's touchdown and run the block he had on Vaughn Bell that got him in but as a receiver he has been invaluable this year came in second in the league and catches he's working on seven of them today and he's just a consummate football Pro gotta love this guy most receptions ever for an NFL receiver through 200 games and he's nearing another 100 yard catch season and look at the names on that list Anquan Boldin now with the Lions a former Cardinal playing in his 200th game today but very interested in winning and yes tied to Carson Palmer and Bruce Arians beyond next year worth discussing catch touchdown Cardinals it's John Brown break throat great catch New Orleans is playing cover to right here and I don't mean to be picking on the kid but Vaughn fell has not had his best day at safety BW Webb is expecting help watch him just sit down in the flat right here he's gonna sink but he thinks that his safety is going to help him he's way late and that is a easy throw for Carson Palmer and his receiver did him a favor and caught the football touchdown that's what they should do only the second touchdown I was saying in the first half for John Brown this season he had seven last year he now ties Kurt Warner for the Cardinals career record with 22 300 yard games that's what you'd expect from a guy like bomber and Brees we haven't talked much about Carson but the day that he's happening today has been been really good and worth pointing out since he spoke with Chandler Catanzaro and our director Michael Frank had a good picture of that after his frustration Catanzaro has not missed a kick that's what a leader does absolutely you can go back to cat zero happy to work with a new holder it could have been part of it I mean I was watching him hit some balls before the game and he operation looked fine but in real time when you're actually out there I mean it's definitely different but I agree Chris those these last three kicks have been spoton right down the middle a 75yard Drive one timeout remaining for each team will have the twominute warning would you onside kick here if you're the Cardinals oh I would I would think that they are going to onside kick and it looks like the way that Chandler Catanzaro is lining this fall up he is but at the end of the day you have to put it on your defense to get the football back here there's supposed number one defense in the league they haven't shown it today they're going to get an opportunity right here Saints have their hands in the air there is a flag down because the ball went out but if it had stayed up in the air the Cardinals would have had a shot and hit it just to fit too hard I think carried it out of out of balance you got to give your outside guys there a chance to make a play on the ball while it's still in bounds but execution was almost there but it's going to give great field position to New Orleans kicking team that fouls declined the results of the play first down they declined that penalty because they would either have to reek ick or take it on the 40 right yes and the weight yeah and you see the way that ball hung in the air Michael Thomas was waiting on it and he was wise to to not get his hands on it knock it back in bounds let it go out so a noble effort on the onside kick could the Saints in charge one timeout for Arizona but it warning straight ahead Mark Ingram playing with fire and we've seen it on that sideline the time that will be used by Arizona right now now Arizona scored Ronde on a 75yard Drive in just over a minute and that was with the touchdown drop so they have shown they can score quickly but as you said their defense has to keep the Saints from getting anything else on the scoreboard yeah first down here ball game over you're gonna get a stop at the twominute warning you're gonna have an important third down if they get the ball here but if you're the New Orleans Saints ball security protect the football we know Mark Ingram had some fumbling issues earlier in the year he's been very solid in that regard of late last probably month of the season take care of the football here for the Saints you come away with a victory drew Brees five fumbles this year for a touchdown it's Ingram again whose meth hard Cardinals on third down stopping him as we will go to the twominute warning Arizona is out of timeouts and it will be an interesting third and four for Drew Brees and Sean Payton protecting a sevenpoint lead here in Arizona today's game is sponsored by Papa John's the official pizza sponsor of the NFL Ronde Barber Chris Myers here in Arizona 89 total points put an important third down where the Saints if they get the first down they iced the victory what do you do here coach you hand it off you run some play accident done with that without a timeout with Arizona more of a clock trying to get him to jump offsides they didn't fall for it and the Saints use their last timeout so you'll have a third and four and then good disciplined by the watch the center max Unger the head Bob Drew Brees will get a head Bob in there too trying to get them to jump offsides but good disciplined by the Cardinals defense what about drew Brees a contract extension that just takes him through next year and he's talked to us about he plans to play well beyond that somewhere it's interesting yeah you talk about to the other guys on the other sideline being intertwined I think Drew Brees and Sean Payton might be intertwined on on this Saints team but hoping to ice this one to get their sixth victory of the year in a wild scoring game throwing on third and four and open calling for the first down is Coby Fleener gutsy we hadn't mentioned Coby Fleener all day and we knew it was going to be mantoman defense and Drew Brees found a matchup with Kobe on cleaner on Tony Jefferson nice delivery and this ball game is all but over and Brees this week after those backtoback games without touchdowns he said I know how to fix the problem I turn it loose I play confident I know what can't happen in certain situations and by that he meant throwing interceptions not afraid to throw for the first down even though Atlanta has won today the Saints can't win the NFC South but still some possibilities miscue as they are for a wildcard and the Cardinals officially eliminated will fall to 5 8 &amp; 1 it was a good game Chris it was entertaining we had some big plays had a lot of offense defense on either side didn't really show up but got to give New Orleans credit when it mattered they forced that turnover of fumble at the end of the game got them up two scores and that to me has been the difference will be the difference in this football game four touchdown passes for Drew Brees over three hundred and eighty yards through the air recordsetting day for david johnson larry fitzgerald came out strongly but the saints come to Arizona and out score the Cardinals 48:41 Saints will take on Tampa Bay in New Orleans next week and then finish up at Atlanta we'll have more from Arizona you're

  "transcript": "Jerald and the Arizona Cardinals fresh off their bye week allowed to turn their season around today hosting the 49ers who welcome back their leading rusher Carlos Han it's a clash of teams in the NFC West as we welcome you to the Valley of the Sun and the NFL hi thanks for being with us along with Super Bowl champ run de barbarac chrismyers glad to have you watching and the Cardinals each year Ronde under Bruce Arians they've gotten better improved their position after where they went last year prior to the season some picked them to go to the Super Bowl so now after the bye week a 3 4 and 1 record at fuel go here a fuel go there things could have change but they have too much talent to have a non winning record Chris I couldn't agree with more on both sides of the ball they have talent offense they got some explosive weapons but I really like what they have on defense all across the board up front in the second area linebacker they have really really talented players and yes it's somewhat of a question mark but they're coming off the bye week I think they're reenergized and ready how they get better they going to start faster the offers has been really slow to start every game this year and that offense led by Carson Palmer II and Larry Fitzgerald and David Johnstone yeah they have a superstar don't they in david johnson fun guy to watch amazing amazing talent but today I'm looking for Michael Floyd and JJ to get some cheap passes down the field they've really struggled with that aspect of their offense all season moment will check out Johnson against up rush defense of the 49ers San Francisco with Colin Kaepernick coming off the game where he threw for nearly 400 yards and now they have Carlos Hyde back that should help the running game and the team overall absolutely will help this team overall Carlos Hyde is a dynamic player they've been struggling without him really maintaining possession of the football and their defense quite frankly is on the field way too long and I think Carlos Hyde being back with the additions and the contributions of Dewan Harris will help this offense get going they're gonna need it if they're gonna try to get a win on the road today well the Cardinals won the first meeting between these two teams in the NFC West that was back in October and Santa Clara by a score of 33 21 Drew Stanton it started for Bruce Arians in that game he threw a pair of touchdown passes to Larry Fitzgerald and Chip Kelly's team after starting the season with a win over the Rams who won by the way today in New York the team has lost seven straight games 49ers trying to end their losing skid and ready to kick off Bradley pinion Phil Dawson does the play scanning Cardinals placekicking Cardinals won the toss and downing it in the end zone so they come out to the 25yard line Oh Carson Palmer said when you come off a loss the good thing is you want to get back out there as quick as you can but they need it the we feel fresh oh they really did they got beat up last week at Carolina I mean Carolina is struggling somewhat on defense that they showed up in force and got after caught Carson Palmer eight sacks just too much they got to find a way to protect them and like I said just said they open they got to get off to a much faster start today they have always scored seven points in the opening quarter one of three teams not to score an opening drive this year Jacksonville and the Giants the other teams Johnson carries and a healthy gain up across the 30 his 49er defense allowing well let's just say embarrassingly historical levels of rush yards 193 per team over 5.3 yards of carry on the ground and even Bruce Arians as much as he loves to go down field must be tempted to keep giving the ball to Johnson I think you're right Chris we'll see a lot of David Johnson not only is a runner he's a great receiver he has very favorable matchups against this somewhat undermanned I'm gonna save 49ers defense second down forward look just off the mark going to tight end Jermaine Gresham you know one of the things that you talk about this Cardinals offense getting off to a slow start is it's this it's drops it's missed opportunities in the passing game down the field and come up with a third and four to start this football game it looks like another slow start after a night at the convert period keep waiting just under 63 percent of us throws only ten touchdowns this season for Carson Palmer said I can't force the deep throw if it's not there although that's something they had lived on last season winning this NFC West he was trying to go to larry fitzgerald well got a lot of 49ers at the line of scrimmage and carson palmer's forced to make a quick decision really good play by Jimmy Ward on Larry fish Joe some of these matchups you know I think Arizona has some favorable ones against that secondary we'll see how this plays out as this game goes goes on Jeremy Kerley back to receive fair catch call for just beyond the 26 yard line and the 49er offense forcing a three and out so colin kaepernick making his fourth start in fact in his last 16 starts the team as well as lost 13 of those on three this year but looked a little bit more comfortable in the loss last week while he was moving in and out of the pocket and Colin will tell you he likes to be on the run he took actually told me it reminds him of backyard football I like seeing that green grass in front of him given give him options you know this Carroll this Cardinals defense now is stout they're fast they're physical I think they're gonna try to pin their ears back and make Colin Kapernick make a bunch of mistakes today we see how it plays out on first down Kaepernick likes to throw on the road and like sliding around the 30yard line he's averaging just under 8 yards to carry this season and against the defense that statistically is ranked number one not points wise but by yardage wise in the NFL this Cardinal defense and some of the players not even aware of ranked number one on defense one second and eight here comes a flag Brad Alan is our referee illegal block in the back number 82 offense that penalty is declined her down car gulls got the opening kick and after a three and out by Chip Kelly's defense the office facing a third down after the penalty declined against the 49ers spotted just across the 25yard line of the 49ers Carlos Hyde back after missing the last two games with a shoulder injury Kaepernick to throw instead he he had time but Chandler Jones came in for his second sack of the season what an addition Chandler Jones has been to this defense now and there was nowhere for Colin Kaepernick to throw this football challenge Jones out here in a threepoint stance working on Joe Staley matchup of the day this the premium matchup and this guy when you give him that much time he is going to eventually get to the quarterback Colin Kaepernick could not hold that ball that long first couple of series of this game the defense making a statement John Brown went out of bounds but better field position for this Arizona Cardinal offense Carson Palmer at age 36 City spends as much time rejuvenating his body as he does pretty much preparing for the opponent stage of his career I asked him if he feels old he's got a little gray showing in his beard he said it was the bleach from the Sun from the Sun but yeah yeah you have to take care of yourself at this age he looks good his mechanics are still good to me it's just finding a way to complete some of these highvolume plays you just haven't been able to do it some of that's on his receivers a lot of that is on the offensive line not giving up enough time or for two in the passing Department set up again down the field for Nelson looked like there was a tough but no flag Jimmy ward on the coverage a lot of bling Chris I like this no call it was a little contact he didn't to me he didn't look like he pulled him through he was playing the football good no call mama he had his right arm yeah baby I know it never leaves you second down ten those are the things that have been missing from this offense the big shots down physically right was 50/50 tight balls not that that was a 50/50 ball but you got a streaker your fastest receiver running down the field one on one of them with a DB and enabling connect Johnson carries just short of the 34 half yard line I'm on rooks on the tackle Ahmad Ahmad Brooks needs to be this player all the time right here on the inner line of scrimmage just chasing the ball down sometimes it's these defensive ends these outside linebackers for the 49ers get caught watching the football and don't play fast enough but a mock Brooks makes a nice play there get more of that all day this defense came out at the end at the 47 yard line that's one Bethea has it for San Francisco JD Nelson caught it but lost it I think they're right good play by research ere finishing that play and he was beat it's gonna be a first down place threw the football that's a fumble this 49er defense does not create a lot of turnovers you get a big one here early our field communicator in the teal and all replays like scoring plays they review to make sure they are confirmed and again the ruling on the field catch fumble 49er recovery and they will go all the way through that process and communicate a thumbsup 49ers will take over on offense just across midfield colin kaepernick in his offense find themselves in a very very advantageous position right now and Carlos eye of the game hasn't touched it yet let's see if they get him the ball and gets down inside the 45 yard line Carlo sign had a tremendous game in the opener when this 49er team crushed the Rams he's had durability issues you know he doesn't played a full season yes gran you have an AC joint injury it's a painful injury they're better with him for sure of course after four yard pickup pass complete that's McDonald gets inside the 40 going back to hide starter in the first six games rush for a hundred plus yards at Seattle week three as range of motion back can he tolerate pain that'll determine how much he can carry the football today and he's in there on third and short from the 41 lose yardage back at the 45yard line Kenji swear injure sorry party cannot do this on this Arizona defense try to get to the outside they're just way too fast watch DJ's where'd you see them coming into your screen right here guy brings a lot of energy to this defense and starting today with Tyrann Mathieu out you're gonna see a lot of those type of plays from him Patrick Peterson back to return Lozano Bradley pinion fair catch called for inside the 10yard line field position swing for this Cardinal offense impressive start for the third round pick of Northern Iowa David Johnson 21 total touchdowns in the last couple of seasons that's most in the NFL over 2,100 yards from scrimmage the last couple of seasons second among running back behind about.they Freeman eight straight games with 100plus yards from scrimmage that's the longest active streak still going in the NFL and his yardage total from scrimmage averaging an NFL high a hundred thirtynine a game against a defense that has been as porous against the run as one can be so far two carries for Johnson of nine yards he'll get a third before tird fence warm Zamunda last week we had the 49ers game and they started on defense very similar to the way they're starting now fast quick as a game goes on though when they start to tire they start getting assignment errors and you start seeing these gaps open up in march runs but much like last week they're off to a quick start here on that front four or five of this defensive position a three and out they had a catch and a turnover authorities couch did he Brule to catch growing forward near the 44yard line well they want more of this this is Bruce Arians mo right this is what he likes to do throw the ball down the football field I gotta tell you what boys this is a great catch gain of 35 quick snap to Johnson who gets across the 45 carson palmer's said without a doubt he hadn't lost trust didn't waver a moment in Michael Floyd despite some drops earlier this year he actually told us he actually told us that Michael Floyd is gonna catch 40 balls in next eight games of the season and they quick snap that play obviously they didn't want this to come to replay but I think that he maintained possession of that ball anyways Floyd a free agent after this season Ellington splits to the top of the screen as a receiver Johnson the running back who's emotion now that direction Johnson still going inside the 40 of San Francisco he second on a team now with 36 catches well he's the second best option as receiver in this in his football team and it's almost guaranteed when he motions as it backfield splits out he's going to get the football they love his matchup on anybody if it's a linebacker I mean forget about it they even like his matchups on DBS and expect a lot of David Johnson out of the backfield catches after gay 216 Andre Ellington in for him Merson bomber or Fitzgerald who lays out for the catch so that's one a one they're having a out do you contest it's all the microflora cats I'm gonna give that one a nine Michael Floyd was a clear 10 but not bad for this old man Larry Fitzgerald what kiss Larry Fitzgerald 188 games with at least two catch going all the way back to his rookie year of 2004 among the best streaks in the league he does not get old he absolutely is still the same fighter he was four years ago I was playing andre ellington it's down inside the 18 yard line six and a half minute mark of this quarter be interesting Chris to see how they use andre ellington today we've talked to coach Aryans and he was saying they don't know really what to do with him obviously David Johnson doesn't want to come out of the game if you ask him he wants to play every snap but he has some ability some breakaway ability he's a good pass catcher see how they gave him the ball they're on a run and sit there able to use that no one had worked at some receiver in practice because of the ankle injury to Fitzgerald this week down a pound it'll bring a third down Cardinals talked about a fast start with their low numbers in the opening quarter Bruce Arians the off week gave these guys a lot of extra time because he said we knew what we had to do and what we have to do we're capable going on the running streets we need to starve out here thirtythree Fitzgerald for the first down Ronde Barber Chris Myers our Fox crew here in Arizona where it's been a defensive dominated first half or first quarter I should say a fumble takeaway but a 49er defense they couldn't do anything with it and now Carson Palmer has marched the Cardinals all the way down to the fiveyard line on a mix of mostly big throws and big catches he's finding Larry Fitzgerald now it's in this slot at the top of your screen would not be surprised to see him get the football right here he is 16 of his number of touchdowns against the 49 david johnson over 700 yards rushing coming into the game and in this drive it was Michael Floyd and then Larry Fitzgerald to keep this drive going yeah this is this has been a case of anything you can do I can do better and Larry Fitzgerald we know he's the number one target on this football team but Michael Floyd he's got to get involved got to stay involved on this offense he's had his problems with drops this year but if they can get that sit back out of 15 on this offense watch out this journal with a lie was held up an excellent defensive play by Jimmy Ward at Jimmy Ward's having a nice start to his game here the line of scrimmage here allowed the hand fight good jammed hands in his chest nowhere for Larry to go ball is thrown out of bounds anyways but Jimmy Ward he's got the challenge looks to me like he's the one following the 11 around all day now it'd be a matchup we'll have to keep an eye on Ward a former firstround draft pick for Northern Illinois Gerald on third and goal Baumer for david johnson it's a touchdown Cartman's well play mantoman at your own peril down here watch Nick floor he's in Maine coverage on David Johnson you'll see the pick the natural pick of the mantoman covers down he's got a run through that traffic at no chance he has absolutely no chance easy throw a catch and they get off to their fast start Chris scoring a touchdown on the opening quarter that is the first receiving touchdown this season for running back David Johnson who came into the league is a exceptional receiver out of college there are only extra points carson palmer delivers his 11th touchdown pass of the year the ninth touchdown overall already for this guy today's game is sponsored by Southwest history with nothing to hide that's transparency Arizona some spectacular catches by Larry Fitzgerald but they may have taken a toll since he came to the Cardinals sideline he's been speaking with doctors pointing to his ribs where apparently he's experiencing some discomfort and pain Chris we'll keep you updated under the official diagnosis all right thank you three catches already for Larry Fitzgerald as Chandler Catanzaro ready to kick off jacory Shepherd back hit three returns last week averaged almost 35 yards who returned a spark for this 49er team but the kick is deep and he'll have to down it setting up San Francisco's offense at the 25yard line trailing seven to nothing after some exceptional catches by the carsales including one in the end zone by Johnson today's game is sponsored by Bud Light make the right call drink responsibly Bruce Arians and fans wanted a fast start at home they have a seven nothing opening quarter the back Kapernick stroke complete just across the 32 leading receiver from San Francisco burly who watched the football or was he ruled down swear injured was all over check it out they're gonna say rule that he's down so it's not rule to turn over so it's not review there'd have to be a challenge if the Cardinals wanted to go that way and the ruling on the field looks accurate yeah foot for cross well Bruce is gonna throw a red flag here but forward progress being ruled stopped the play is going to be ruled over and he's not gonna be able to challenge this and he's Brad Allen maybe explaining that so he doesn't waste the challenge sorry coach he's old for two this year and challenges anyone calls the ruling on the field with the cooler progress is stuff that play is not reviewable by rule second down thanks for confirming what we already said that appreciate it but yeah that was it was a good play by by DJ smarter and that's what you're getting out of 36 on this Cardinals defense every time he's around the football he's impactful going after the fall laying people out and I know that tired Matthew is a big part of this defense but you're not missing much of a beat with a guide like DJ playing the way he's been playing lately after all that occurred in forward knock down on the back wheel is Quentin bathroom Josh morrow making the play Oh Josh morose one of those guys that you don't hear a lot of about standing up number 97 tried to get the influence blocked by the tight in right there but he didn't fall for it did its job but right upfield made a great play free agent from Stanford now third and 10 after a loss of six Kaepernick just short of the 30 Torrey Smith making the catch but it'll be fourth down Smith have the sore back he's hasn't missed a game Ron dated six year career but he has only 15 catches yeah it's unbelievable this guy can't get involved in this offense he's got deadly speed I would just throw some balls up to him just put him on a goround maybe not against Patrick Peterson want to go round and see if he could make a play down the football field that's what he's getting paid to do Bradley Pena second most pumps in the NFL this season the way to do it twice last week John Brown calling for the fair catch and the Cardinal offense will take over with just under two minutes to play in the opening quarter and protecting a seven to nothing lead this is for everyone are you ready we'll take on two fine Nissan innovation that excites by Verizon join a better network because better matters and by Burger King now gets realized pancakes for all the eightynine cents only at Burger King roof blows once again what is it never really open for a cardinal game with your outside here I'm glad this thing's closed season six out of seven the last time they had the football was Carson Robert Johnson Ares and he finished with a touchdown catch twenty second career touchdown already for the secondyear lawyer who really I don't know if around the league he gets enough attention for all that he's done in the short time that he's been playing I think he will he just he has spectacular runs he's already seen today what he could be as a pass catcher I think people here know exactly what they have it David John says just a matter of time as a secondyear player is certainly ascending he is very very unique and the NFL world will know his name before too long six carries today only 15 yards on the ground blaghhh false start offense number 73 fiveyard penalty second down John Wetzel who's filling in for the injured Jared ball dear a major blow losing Bruce Arians losing his best offensive lineman certainly is and Wetzel who started the last time these two teams played at card gets an opportunity to play on his more natural position at left halfback tackle he's got a day today he's got two good rushers on the outside of montrose and get on that side as well eli herrings are there for Aaron Lynch who stands up today after the penalty second and 13 Fitzgerald is back in the game catches and knock down around the 25 Pittsburgh Steelers game losing streak Ben Roethlisberger Rogers Pittsburgh 12 three early in this one I thank you very much the Cowboys started the season with a loss then won seven in a row 49ers started the season with a win that was seven in a row growling Junoon incomplete trying to go to david johnson complaining about his receiver maybe being held up gets fourth down what are you looking at with something else thrown in from Bruce Arians he's arguing about the contact Eric Reeve put on the running back out of the backfield and you were defending that a moment ago and tickle Jeremy Jeremy Kerley with some room he's loose here comes a flag and he goes down on the ball comes out now the Cardinals have it inside their own 45 yard line gave Martin has the fumble during the original return there was an illegal block in the back but number 84 the return team that penalty will be declined as the only number killers the fumble well if it's not one thing it's another with the 49ers what really good return here Curley coughs it up at the end in Arizona's back in business 49ers lead and have the football at the end of one quarter here in Arizona you're watching the NFL on Fox we had set out for Arizona Ryan quickly the punter was the closest to him Ronde but I don't know if he touched him let's see after they reviewed it I like her with you I don't think that Quigley touched his body at all and because of that he's not down by contact when he hits the ground so yes I think that's the correct call Michael Pereira our rules analyst confirms that watching back in Los Angeles the ground does not always caused a fumble don't fall into that cliche I'm not a cliche guy did you say I did say no I just want to make sure people don't say the ground causes a fumble just like the pile on does it go all the way around yes do you need to be touched down but 44 yard line as we change quarters so they go the other way of the Cardinals with a 7 to nothing lead number for 49ers 4 turnovers last week lost ones it is bomber comes out throwing and going for take Jay Nelson some fighting going on and planning all the way down the field there with Jimmy Ward I'm gonna let you tell me if this is pass interference a lot of contact on both sides and again I say let off play well quarterbacks realized you throw the ball up there though you got a 50/50 chance to pick catch and 50/50 and they're a part of it you know a lot of the lot of teams take shots especially when they have big wide receivers because you know cores are mostly smaller they don't have an opportunity to play the ball because they got to fight with the receiver all the way down the field so you know police is just as good as a pass interference in this case it's a big game for the partners Jennsen gets down there to go on there's a flag down outside defense spending 55 the penalty is declined the ruling on the field is a touchdown an 18 yard run after that 38 yard penalty I have a such a hard time classifying what type of runner David Johnson is he's big and he's strong but he has those quick feet he saw that little stutter put the defender one step behind him and I think that is a great effort touchdown you know he had that same situation if you guys remember on that tie game in Seattle going to the pylon and he did not reach out and touch it and they didn't score and they tied that football game but this is a great effort by David Johnson and thunder further review and of course he has to maintain possession of that football into the pylon I'll take a break in take another look ruled a touchdown on the field and the booth review to confirm the point team ruled to touchdown Mike Pereira our rules analyst taking a closer look as the booth is here in Arizona Mike what do you think well two things that have Brad Allen's looking at is number one does he have control of the ball when it touches the pylon yes is that left toe down out of bounds before the ball breaks the plane which I actually think it is if you look at that left toe just drags on the sideline before the ball touches the pylon which would make them short after reviewing the play the will another field fans touchdown now bike if that toe was in the air if it wasn't down that you were just referred to then that's the reason this call stood yeah and that's clearly the shot from behind made it look like possibly it's in the air to me I think it's on the ground but I will say one thing we have said this week in and week out if there's any question whatsoever they're staying with the call on the field and that's obviously what they did there you can make a case the toes down but is it clear and obvious obviously in New York and there they thought not thank you Mike Pereira on for the extra point Chandler Catanzaro to make it 14 nothing early here in the second quarter people at home he still might be wondering was it or was it not but score and another touchdown for David Johnson David Johnson taking over here with a touchdown catch in a touchdown run a guy who didn't want to leave the field they might rep what about defense although they don't be a Toni to who this Cardinal defense is playing Corey Shepherd back to return and look at the total yards already 14 nothing Cardinals coming off the bye week hoping to get to 500 that'll be a touchback out to the 25yard line well the Cardinals defenders of the NFC West and many thought of as a playoff team certainly the fast start they wanted that they got that and for the 49ers in that seven game losing skid is this more of the same it really is and they're just not a good enough football team to overcome giveaways they're dead last in the NFL points off of giveaway so if they give the ball away the team that almost guaranteed to go down and score they just aren't able to compliment themselves very well and if their offense can't get going slow start and just set it for yards of total offense isn't gonna get it done against the team that's getting that fast start these car votes what is asking here against the Stila list of his career as hi carries to the 30 there was a forty seven two seven loss when he threw four interceptions you want to look at the unraveling of Colin Kaepernick I think it was this game you know he threw the four interceptions two of them returned for touchdowns the next week he goes to Green Bay and he admitted that he played a little bit timid didn't want to be the guy to cause them to lose a football game and he just spiraled out of control from there on out oh and three and starts this year following Blaine Gabbert has kaepernick peace runs the game referencing the interceptions to were returned for touchdowns it was an avalanche against this Arizona team and Kaepernick did not recover and either under 49ers intestines say neither has the football team you know he was such a dynamic playmaker early in his career and just that little bit of lot lack of confidence is absolutely destroying him somewhat as a quarterback in this league rose and it's incomplete try to go to Quinton Patton Justin Bethel on the coverage mats coming off a career best game over a hundred receiving yards well this this offense when they have to start chasing the football game you get out of the running mentality you can't turn around the handoff the Carlos Hyde put the game in the hands of the arm of Colin Kaepernick and I just don't think that he's good enough to throw the ball 4050 times a game and when he may have to run ten or fifteen times to help this offense on second and ten he has time open in the middle is Vance McDonald McDonald all the way down inside the 30 of Arizona Vance McDonald big game last week tied in at the top of your screen here and just finds away sits down in the zone good job by Colin Kaepernick they're keeping his eyes available to the tight end delivers a good ball and they pick up a big game 32 yard pickup he's had big plays this year McDonald 75 and 65 yard touchdown catch it's knotted at the 28 of Arizona Kapernick up first down steps up in the pocket and completes Rock Streeter with a catch good enough for a first down let's get a game break check in with Curt Menefee and the rookies continue to lead Dallas dak Prescott with his green pastures eco Elliot this is on 2nd and 18th he goes to the house 83 yards on the reception longest touchdown reception of Elliott's young career longest touchdown pass the puska hits 12 10 in Pittsburgh this Thank You Kurt I'll be keeping a close eye on that game after a gain of 11 on for the ends of one touchdown 49ers Jeremy Kerley the one thing about Colin Kaepernick you know you have to stay alive scramble plays in the secondary are just so difficult and you're gonna see some confusion here on this secondary Marcus Cooper number 41 drops the coverage gets his eyes in the backfield can't be greedy get your eyes in the backfield you lose your man and Colin Kaepernick does a good job finding the open receiver that's his fifth touchdown pass of the season Chip Kelly has defended him from the different surgeries in the offseason meanwhile the Cardinal defense that's only the sixth touchdown pass Houston the leak coming in that they'd given up this year and Kaepernick brings the 49ers within seven of the Cardinals here in Arizona today's game is sponsored by Chevrolet more 2016 G Depot dependability awards than any other brand by Papa John's the official pizza sponsor of the NFL and by Microsoft Surface the official tablet of the NFL the theme for the Cardinals today was to flip the script and it actually started two weeks ago on that plane ride home from Carolina with Goliath Cambo Larry Fitzgerald Carson Palmer and Patrick Peterson had a veteran's meeting and decided to tell this team that hey adversity is a good thing you haven't had to do it in the Bruce Arians era too very much but this year we're gonna make it a positive and make that playoff run deep Chris the sevenpoint lead in the second quarter with two men back to return and no chance we'll come out to the 25yard line Cardinals have the football and a 147 lead here in the second quarter nobody comes into this one NBC and Monday Night Football on ESPN then week 11 kicks off with Thursday Night Football in Carolina Bruce Arians blew up at the half he said for the first time since he was a coach at temple back when this team was giving beats prior to their bye week by Carolina said some things were broken I usually didn't yell because it people don't learning anything you're not teaching that you're doing that with the team responded better in the second half and they've come out here with a little bow she's across the 45 yard line now when this offense gets on rhythm it is very very hard to stop and Carson Palmer is good in the pocket with his mechanics is anybody and he hits it back foot and that ball comes out there it DB's and it unless they're guessing he's got no chance to stop it now the good drop out receiver and good delivery by the quarterback and a big game 1st down 21 yard pickup mom are over 130 yards passing Ellington in the backfield David Johnson's touched the ball nine times today already has two touchdowns brought down at the 42 and I'm on Brooks you pointed out earlier has to play big does come on Zig again well the one thing talking to the forty niners that they know they need to do is penetrate more get these guys up front to run through some gaps and cause some disruption in the backfield you know when I watch them I see a lot of these they're it they're interior lineman just standing up not finding gaps or you know causing any bouncing of the football and right there at my fork does a good job create some disruption after the loss of 3under out of the minutes before that Gerald fortyniners are in on him for a minimal gain started with Jimmy Warren Lynch remain Rock came over as well one of the alltime great receivers you mentioned Ronda how he has consistently put up great numbers against the 49ers he does it against everybody as you look at the alltime reception list course Jerry Rice you put him on the enemy's ever gonna catch him but he moves ahead of Terrell Owens the rest of those guys Hall of Fame in front of them he's just a matter of time whatever worked five years after he decides to give up this game and he'll be an old favorite to him if he's lost a step and still a half a step ahead of father time that's a nice way of saying you're old it's trying to be a couple of better here comes some flags in football years of course wrong yes preface that number 58 defense fiveyard penalty her down Eli Harold he got the start in place of the injured Aaron Lynch and that's a an easy penalty for Eli Harold's a guy that needs to get some active is a fantastic athlete fabulous athlete but I don't see him getting in the backfield too much enough talent to challenge this left tackle over here and you know that he's getting his first start at left tackle Wetzel safely keep an eye out and see if you can get some pressure on the fourth back he's gonna run for the first down and slide at the 35 but San Francisco that's gonna be a holding call Chris but it doesn't matter Carson Palmer doing something we don't very often see him do holding automatic first down that calls on Jimmy worid Jimmy wardeness lot talked about him working on Larry Fitzgerald Larry's at the handful he's good off the line of scrimmage I think that's the right call as well but Carson Palmer doing it with his legs picking up first down turn 37 years old in December 16 yards from the 30 bitch Jared lost no catch those rare moments where you don't see larry fitzgerald hang on to it larry has such strong hands I mean he's a it's almost like a tight end sizewise catch radius is ridiculous but it's it's a good play when you're knocking a ball out of larry fitzgerald ten he's just he's a vacuum nothing ever falls out of his hands usually but good play by the 49 secondary there Larry he went to the Pro Bowl last year nine times a Pro Bowler great season the Cardinals had last year hoping to build off of that going forward second and ten Ellington as a receiver in the slot for Fitzgerald it's knocked away by war as Paul was just a touch behind him but seeing the good and the bad from Jimmy Ward got a couple of interference penalties but good tribe on the ball he sees it out nice play brings up third down that run by Carson Palmer of 16 yards that's the longest run of Carson Palmer's career then that surprises you about what he ran for a touchdown last year ahead Trump is flaky the wife said that wasn't me he tried to just disown that whole experience third and ten from the thirty Fitzgerald just short of the first down marker on say Johnson was with him see if Bruce Arians is going for it or lining up for a field goal again good job by Dante Johnson getting Larry Fitzgerald on the ground but that's a win for the 49ers defense they were getting pushed down the field again carson palmer finding his favorite receiver larry johnson but stopping short on third down create a field goal opportunity that's something they go to sideline and be proud about so I had a 60 yarder this year but fans will remember the misses against Seattle in the overtime tie but this time from 39 yards Chandler Catanzaro delivers for the Cardinals Arizona with a 177 second quarter lead how to go live if you're not enough on Fox is sponsored by Lowe's with Ronde Barber Chris Byers glad you're watching the NFL on Fox jacory Shepard ready to return the kick from Chandler Catanzaro here in Arizona hope you're enjoying week 10 the Cardinals are so far after a week of rest a tenpoint lead we'll Shepard have a chance he's coming out now short of the 15yard line excellent special teams played by Kate Martin's not a fumble recovery earlier he in honor of Veterans Day for every point scored during salute to service games the NFL will donate to its military nonprofit partners including the Pat Tillman foundation also the USO and the Wounded Warrior Project you can visit nfl.com slash salute the local hero a true hero Pat Tillman who wore number 40 and this past Sunday would have been his 40th birthday and remembering him on their helmets remembered Kapernick to throw and incomplete last drive when they went in for the touchdown Kaepernick was three out of four they marched 75 yards and he's connected with Curley for the touchdown the Colin Kaepernick's able to extend plays you know he's he can make him in the passing game but now what this offense has done the last two weeks has had some really big explosive passes Vance McDonald has been the guy to who showed up for his quarterback and had those crucial catches when they need him Carlos Hyde down at the 10yard line these guys are so good up front names whether it's Callay is Campbell Peters whoever they play fast they play aggressive and you get yourself in a third long situation and watch out James back to the defensive coordinator has his entire playbook to play with here see if Colin cavernous office able to deal with it fortyniners that movement and a penalty full story Joshua Garnett the rookie get the crowd and assist on that one back at the fiveyard line need to get all the way up to the 24 from his own end zone third down Kaepernick is on target to Torrey Smith and good enough for the first down there's that guy you're looking for Torrey Smith hasn't been much of a fact you said he only came in with 15 catches well this is a big one watch the delivery this is captain his best hitting his back foot just letting it that's slinging it give you a receiver a chance nice throw nice catch big first down complacent keep this draft going down the column of Kaepernick backed up in his own end zone with a crowd of power pickup of 21 on third down now on first down he dumps it off where it's a moons on what it's just short of the 40 with another first down well this is what we've seen of late Collins found the rhythm it really has in the passing game especially the short intermediate I say it week in and week out when I watch this guy he doesn't like to push it down the field he's inaccurate but the stuff underneath letting his playmakers make plays they've been pretty good at it here this week and blast he's 9 of 11 over 100 yards passing after a pickup of 13 that's patent emotion from the 39 of San Francisco Carlos hi hesitates and surges forward to about the 43 how comfortable does Carlos Hyde look to you after the layoff I think he looks good that was a great six yard run it looked like he was gonna get tackled in the backfield I love how physical he gets at the to finish off runs and I know that they've missed that element of this offense the numbers not impressive he's working his way back into Chip Kelly's offense De La Harris had brought a lot of energy and big plays last week comes in it running back eres the football stop run away will bring a third down the challenge of playing a Chip Kelly off it's and the Arizona Cardinals at play to make played Philly now they're looking at colin kaepernick and you see you'll see them moving around trying to give different looks because that's the one thing chip is really good at when he figures out what you're in then he can attack you this to me this Cardinal defense right now is giving so many different looks I don't think he can really lock in on what's going on yet Cardinals blitz more than any team in the league on third and four like they're coming they are kaepernick catch blade curly little first down at the 48 bomb arizona cook a place in there but the communication on this Cardinals defense right here is is lost a little bit bring a guy in motion they're playing mantoman and two guys cover one and Kaepernick finds the open receiver converts that first down can't shake that tackle they'll Buchanan who leads the team in tackles guy that's only 215 pounds playing essentially middle linebacker and he is impressive he flies around he strikes people right in the middle of your screen they're number 20 shoots a gap in just no chance for Dhawan Harris to come out of that tackle after a loss of one Murdoch has run just twice so far today straight ahead eros out of the 41 will bring up third down Devon Harris mild up 142 yards from scrimmage last week in what was his first start of the season coming against the Saints he had a touchdown a 47 yard reception on third and three he remains the back Kapernick can run he's brought down short of the first down a big lie by marcus Golden's well again this Cardinal defense given so many different looks and colin kaepernick just couldn't find the guy that he wanted to but i think they're gonna go for it here Chris and I don't disagree with this call you're downtown you're on the road you've lost seven straight Kaepernick completes for the first down Vance McDonald with his third catch of the game for Chip Kelly by the way that s eight that card is really just a cover up to throw people off from peeking in on his play she's you know what they found here though Chris they've got some rhythm going in the offense and everybody wants to talk about the playing fast or not playing fast they're playing smart I'd like the way they're playing right now and pull out of the huddle put stress on the defense because they can't substitute and you jerk you're always under stress as a defender maybe down to the 31 yard line nearing the twominute warning each team still with three timeouts remaining and we have reached the twominute warning in Arizona just past the halfway point of the NFL season Cardinals with a 177 lead but the 49ers are threatening these players follow your favorite team all season long go to iTunes dotcom slash NFL Quinton Patton of the 49ers thanking the military all the servicemen and women salute to the Troops we can them talk about Veterans Day incomplete for Vance McDonald now be third down Kaepernick 11 out of 14 116 yards with a touchdown sauce each team has suffered a turnover in this first half it's a nice drive here 13 plays very balanced seeing a little bit of McCollum has kind of emerged here the last couple of weeks as a passer the big third down here he's got to find a completion gonna see mantoman coverage from these Cardinals right now good good throw need eight yards they get nothing it's a 50yard field goal try to the 30 you can and made sure he didn't get loose like I said you get off schedule you get 1/3 long and you know they're gonna blitz they bring everybody they have so much trust in their secondary to cover whoever on the other side and you get that much pressure colin kaepernick just had nowhere to go cardinals use a timeout on 4th down and six with just over a minute and a half Cardinals will have two remaining 49ers have all three I filled officer to try from 49 yards he is 29 of 29 under 50 yards eleven of twelve this season it's fortyniners cut into the lead it's only a seven point game now Chip Kelly was hoping his team would get a little closer so they might be able to go for it on fourth down but on fourth and six with a guy like Phil Dawson easy decision Phil Dawson is like the weather here in Arizona it's reliable you know what you're gonna get out of here tomorrow night National Geographic advise you to go to Mars join humankind's greatest adventure and find out how we made Mars hall the new series Mars premieres tomorrow night Holi on National Geographic well for the Cardinals and their expectations let's give the underdog 49ers some credit for hanging in there well they stay in every game it's in the first at first half its it'll be interesting because they just continue to collapse late in football games and you know we've speculated that it's the where to be snaps on the defense not on the points on offense but last week if they don't have that fumble by Mike Davis at the goal line against the Saints I mean that game is one score they just continue to shoot themselves in the foot to see if they're able to keep it up this hot start in the second half Britton golden from just across the 17yard line early game headlines on the visa halftime report the Packers shocks as Tennessee with the upset win 47 to 25 over Aaron Rodgers and Green Bay the fine play of their young quarterback the Rams beat the Jets 9 to 6 Denver beat New Orleans some of the results the Buccaneers winning at home over Chicago and Washington defeated the Vikings in DC Carolina had a lead but lost it home to Kansas City and I'll show you highlights of that Steeler Dallas game coming up on the visa on first down Carson Palmer / Floyd catch made run around the first sound marker david johnson it was given a breather the last series or two is back into it running back this is where good quarterbacks shine and carson palmer's as good as anyone in two minutes situations it's got all these weapons to work with david johnson being one of them interesting to see what the 49ers trying to do here on defense they got their dime defense and so eric reid is essentially playing linebacker in the middle of the field by Michael Floyd and wisely gets out of bounds to preserve time on the clock for the Cardinals you still have those two timeouts well there's a great rush on the outside great rush on the inside and offensive line kind of getting pierced right here but carson palmer's this has a great job releasing this ball and Michael Floyd look at the route in and out get the defender turned around who communication Michael Floyd's have himself a little bit of a day here three catches for him Larry Fitzgerald the game's leading receiver with six catches first the 45 yard line by Jimmy ward Andre Ellington comes into the backfield on second and 3 from the 46 clock running firing Jay Nelson three 49ers back there lock stops third and three take a look at this hit here Larry Fitzgerald went off the field after this and had the ribs early gets tumbled up on his back in his neck that looks like it could be a need to keep an eye on him see how he's doing on the sidelines and he was bothered by a sore ankle a bit during the week that he was able to rest it and practice course the veterans like Carson Palmer and Fitzgerald get Wednesday is usually a day off of practice he remains on the sideline held on to that to first down still two timeouts now under 40 to play pressure picked up bombers cut chessboard Cardinals log start to believe he might actually get 40 catches in the last eight games been apart so they came up today timeout for the gargles they'll have one remaining Larry's Fitzgerald headed to the locker room after taking that spill he made a couple of big catches early and this is the one Rhonda that has you concerned yeah I mean that first catch definitely hurt his ribs that he planted on his neck there but they were looking at his knee on the sidelines and he is he's almost irreplaceable in his offense JJ nelson Michael Ford John Brown your receivers David Johnson the running back Boyd already knows four catches in the game for the endzone and JJ Nelson no Keith Reaser back there on the coverage the play by Keith Reaser he is on an island right here all by himself there's a whole safety but he's got to make this play he doesn't get a lot of time out on the field he's having to play with injuries no panic here plays through the receivers hands could play Cardinals with one timeout at the 26 of San Francisco 18 seconds remain 49ers get the football this Bruce Aaron's team will be kicking off to the 49ers to start the second half turn Carson bomber Willa pull it on target Nelson inside the 50 and time out for the Cardinals will have none remaining lot going on to the crazy week 10 let's check with curtain Los Angeles coming up on the visa halftime the Minnesota Vikings disappoint with their fourth straight loss the Eagles defense dominates as they soar past the Falcons and Tennessee upsets Aaron Rodgers to the Green Bay Packers we've got all of that and more so we'll see you back here Lisa naptime thanks Kurt nice to see you Terry and Howie watch it closely as we all will be in high light so that Dallas Pittsburgh and Jim O'Neill defensive coordinator moved upstairs last week you wanted a little vantage point actually asked him if he was going to stay up there and he said you know what just depending on how it goes this week he'll make a decision it's week two week right now the way his team is the point of the second half he may not want to see them from anywhere if they have to dig in here the first attempt time for Carson Palmer in complete there's a flag he was trying to go to david johnson eric reid late well this is a tough one he's he's beat originally because he doesn't turn and play the ball that's that that's the penalty but trying to get back hit play through David Johnson's hands there it is close I mean I understand why they called it but I'll say it for the third time let them play man not a smart way from read and now they're set up now only six seconds in no timeouts so a 49ers stop and we could end that unless they come out throw it and they do Carson not the legs don't two seconds remain to be worn with a big plug get me warts all over the place today I think that's this third or fourth pass breakup and he's working on a big tight end and he's got to keep his eyes on his target good job not falling for that play fake almost a drop look like it tiny could have caught that the key bet Dallas had that in his bucket just wasn't able to hold on to it Chandler Catanzaro to trial the field goal give Jim O'Neill on that defense credit it's a major stopping another swing at that points here another stop in the red zone with two seconds Bruce Arians hops for the shore points and gets him to again open up a tenpoint lead Cardinals with a 20 to 10 advantage and again we'll be kicking off to start the second half to the 49ers let's head to Los Angeles for the visa halftime report with today's excitement brought to you by the new nissan titan david johnson exciting with a couple of touchdown since the start of 2015 he has the most touchdowns in the NFL and he has the car goes out in front of the 49ers as we get ready for the third quarter that's today's excitement brought to you by the new Nissan Titan Rodney Barbara's Chris Myers getting ready to go here and this NFC u.s. clash good to see Larry Fitzgerald move looks like he had a knee brace on when he came out yeah it did take me praise underneath that stocking now now he's a guy that can't afford to lose Chris he does so much at that Z receiver flocking catching all those underneath passes from Carson Palmer Kaepernick 11 on a 14 with a touchdown pass in the first half and jacory Shepard who last week gave the team quite a lift it but searching Chip Kelly has for somebody on the return team Chip Kelly had him in Philadelphia he was injured defensive back and healthier now sixth round pick from Kansas hoping to set up the 49er offense if he gets the chance scaffold zero who is two for two in the fuel department and he will doubt it 25yard line let's check in with Jennifer on Fitzgerald well Chris the good news for Cardinals fans Larry Fitzgerald is a full go this half the Arizona athletic training staff did examine that knee at halftime if there's no damage there's no worry as long as it keeps that knee brace on I spoke with Bruce Arians and he says there will be no restrictions on Larry he wouldn't let him go if he was worried people continue to be a big part of this offense this app Chris no doubt thank you and he was in the first half Jennifer with seven catches to lead all receivers good for 56 yards some spectacular some tough catches but knots about the 49ers on offense the first half hasn't been their problem Ronda it's what happens in the second half during the sevengame losing streak first down Kaepernick on the run with wonder on and slides around the 27 yard line 49ers have been outscored 58 to 13 in the third quarter this year during this losing skid ship Kelly when we said we sure team tiring wearing down he said no second half we've become onedimensional most of those GATS exactly right when you got to drop back and throw the football it just takes the rhythm completely out of your offense put too much pressure on your quarterback they just got to find a way to stay in games and give themselves a chance at the end second down throwing into copper expanse McDonald the target it'll be third down buchanan on the coverage debut cannon right here in the middle of this primary coverage here he's a former safety right playing linebacker this is a fantastic reaction to the throw QB key ball outbreak nice pass defense remember this is the number one defense statistically in the NFL coming into this week ten measure it by yards giving up on 3rd and 8th yeah predict we'll get away from one but brought down short of the 25 but Chandler Joel Calvin Meador got there first and slowed him down yeah when they could just they could bring six guys have primary coverage oneonone by the five guys on the back end I mean quarterback has no chance there's no way to get rid of he's got to get rid of the ball quicker guys aren't opening he's holding it and he's not gonna run away from this defense Bradley pinyon his second season punting for the 49ers John Brown at his third for the Cardinals his first year as their punt returner takes it out of bounds where the Cardinal offense led by Carson Palmer will take over today's team is sponsored by Southwest yes to low fares with nothing to hide that's transparency by the allnew 2017 Ford Super Duty this is the next level and by Miller Lite the original light beer back here in Arizona there's some big decision makers in the state it's a great military veteran John McCain Senator Steve the ownership of the gargles david johnson carries wellthis 49er defense came in Ronde on the ground allowing over a hundred ninety rush yards a game and so far against david johnson who's sent outstanding he has scored but at least they're not getting run over I mean the last couple of weeks it's been 200 yards 200 yards 200 yards rushing but getting some credit to those guys up front I don't have Arik Armstead so putting dials plan one defensive end seen a lot more snaps out of Glenn Dorsey at the nose tackle I think that has helped them today so named Gresham the triangle a inside the 40 San Francisco I guess if you're worried about stopping the run Carson Palmer is gonna pick you apart well you get Eric read mantoman coverage here on Crescent he just doesn't do a good enough job really good throw by Carson Palmer I'm gonna go to the line quick here mama over 230 yards passing to hear that for David John and there's Larry Fitzgerald 49ers surrounding him he gets all the way down inside the six yard line Larry Fitzgerald right here just the police if leaflet flickered I can't get that out David John's you talked about them having an identity and running the ball well give the ball toss it back and Larry Fitzgerald looks none the worse to wear for that knee fleaflicker it's easier to say than to do something good right but it worked and the numbers on Larry Fitzgerald impressive they always are it seems against this 49ers not backing down at the 18yard line DeForest Buckner these first round traffic from Oregon for sack of the game for this 49er team member was eight sacks for Carson Palmer in their last game two weeks ago against Carolina watch to force Buckner right here in the middle just push this pocket and he doesn't get the sack or he gets the sack here but it's Quentin dial I'm sorry that's pushing the pocket it forces Carson Palmer to bounce back and forth Buckner the firstround draft picks played almost every snap on defense last week he's got some expectations on young guy to have to play that much inside his diplo but he's handled it pretty well those loose ruled a fumble on the field and recovery San Francisco Eli Harold forced that fumble and recovers by Buckner good hustle play by Eli Harold and I gotta tell you carson palmer's can't get rid of that football gotta feel the shadow of the defender coming into t to make that play you know he's not gonna outrun anybody what Ronald Blair excuse me actually got there first whoever actually between him and Buckner they recover that ball but right it looked like Palmer had time yet time didn't have a receiver open in the back of the end zone that sometimes you just got to give up on a play get rid of the ball live to fight the next down they needed to take away in this red area and this is three good stops now by this 49er defense to that resulted in field goals and now they get the ball back for their offense second takeaway for the 49er defense today from the 20 Kapernick to throw no indeed five of Arizona adjusted Bethel is having to play corner are usually just a special teams guy and putting Patten just distance them it's got a step and a half this balls out in front this is a big touchdown this times has jumped to Chris is in good position air at the end he was catching up the nice big play explosive play for this 49ers office just has seen a lot of the last couple of weeks now gain of 45 yards Chip Kelly shows that that has become the reliable target he brings energy every game 49er offense between passes Vance McDonald Torrey Smith and Carlos Hyde along with Kaepernick last week last week it was de Juan Harris advance McDonald with the big completions and runs and give this Kapernick some time he's finding some receivers and some big plays of this offense from the 30 on second and five and getting rid of it it'll be third down from the 30yard line Claude Harris the running back Kapernick goes down at the 35yard line like so good for him look like the layest Campbell at Marcus golden circled around just a lot of bodies around them and again just know where this is Elka for right here nowhere for a Colin Kapernick delivered his ball and just look at the roulette less effort of everybody up front Okafor gets the benefit at the pocket being pushed by coleus Campbell but yes if he can't get the ball out of his hands faster it's gonna be more of this the same these guys are too good up front swear injure firing up the defense now that field goal try is from 53 yards for filled awesome it's up there it's out there and it's good there he is one field goal away from 400 in his amazing career and he appreciates it after the take away by the 49ers Phil Dawson on the field goal and it's now a sevenpoint game over 300 total yards of offense for the Cardinals and yet it's a one score game down short of the 23yard lines this season Fox in the NFL celebrating football families game days bringing families together that's the Diaz Garcia family sharing with us today their first ever Cardinal game as a family hosted by Fox in the NFL they get to hang with Ronda and I've worked a siren senior airman John Diaz Garcia's wife Lorraine and little Gabriella enjoying today's game and of course enjoying seats for our salute to service weekend we thank him and all our military for all the good they do football family and America's family to go here in the third Johnson to lose more you arts there and nothing nothing they're just stretching out the run plays David Johnson has no gaps to do what he does best again to give some credit words do now Quentin dial is having a good game a defensive end he was a guy that had the bust last week that led to that big explosive run but they're doing a good job here today and David Johnson came in averaging four and a half yards to carry this 49er defense has kept him under four yards at least on the nine carries he has still has a couple of touchdowns second of eleven Yetta Larry Fitzgerald this week was asked about the identity of this team during the bye week and where they were and he said we're a we're really a run a running offense first that's what we do I think they they mean in the in Bruce's heart Bruce Arians heart he wants to throw footballs those cars in Palmer but when you have a guy like David Johnson who is so explosive who can make you hit a home run every time he gets the football you got to go the office has to go through him and I think that's the realization and that's what Larry's coming from with that coming and it helps protect Carson Palmer as well his arm was grabbed here counting flags from all different directions rock was all over him like I can't excuse him here it's interference of the utmost down that was holding pass interference all and one in three flags went down three official on the field saw that one well Floyd was not targeted with a single pass in the last game at Carolina that's another target today he has four catches and with that penalty they move the ball up to the 37 yard line of the first turn Carson Palmer which the other way and complete main pressure movement Dizzy's in the last quarter and a half just an observation as 49ers defense are playing some different bodies Michael willhoite said it linebacker Shayne Skov who we thought would get some snaps at linebacker a few weeks ago was also in it linebacker for Nick velour so they're they're experimenting you know Jim O'Neill is trying to find some combination guys that can play so far today I'd say they've had some success Johnson of second and Rosalyn wohl is tap carry of the game the 49ers stench remember they have that string of 100 yard rushers seven straight games which is an NFL record and part of that is david johnson after their earlier meeting again just there's penetration upfront I haven't seen it in games past from this 49ers defensive front but seeing bodies get bounce back Don off by the offensive line of the Cardinals and that's why they're struggling to run a football six defensive backs on third and eight Johnson in motion that wings on the running back number two row Keith's research but acting with Jimmy Ward alder really has been and you know he's a young guy that had to play a little bit before but you know it helps that he has helped safety overthetop help here he's just playing to mantoman with safety help over top so he can sit on that underneath throw good pass break up again by Keith Lisa Jeremy Kerley Ryan quickly to pun no fair catch from pearlies spun out of bounds around the 20yard line the underdog 49ers in the bottom of the NFC West hanging in there for the Cardinals today's game is sponsored by the allnew 2017 Ford Super Duty this is the next level well the 49ers are trying to end that seven game losing skid after shutting out their opponent in their first game to win the first pro football team since the 1925 Dayton triangles to accomplish such a strange note and know what dick Stockton's was not there to call that because like first out 49ers Carlos Hyde hadn't done much this guy definitely played that game he looks angry that's it obscure dad how did how do we find out we have people that that is their job to research all during the week excellent step good stop five minutes to go in the third quarter going backwards there was nowhere for him to go really nowhere to go I mean Carlos I'd has to stop it stutter here because look at Garrett right there kitten knock backwards like Xavier Williams and completely destroyed their funny play yeah you'll wonder why do Juan Harris who's now in the game haven't seen much of them explosive than as much energy brought last week hasn't had that many snaps today for a loss of three it's during 11 loads Bob's quitting that was in the area code but its fourth down they had a nice second series drive down the field and get the field goal here but you know this is this is another problem that the 49ers have if so many three and outs not talking the defense we talked about why they fade and chip can say because they're behind the game so they're not that far behind in games but when you have three announce on offense really straight at your defense Bradley pinion written golden from his 30 straight ahead for five yards that's where the Cardinal offense will take over Cardinal offense still looking for those big explosive plays before Danny got his yardage today Larry Fitzgerald on the alltime receiving yardage list Andre Johnson of course announcing his retirement earlier this year so he's all Evan at the moment his 13th pro season and toughing it out today with a catches for 88 yards 35 garsun Palmer hesitates and gets rid of it I wanted to take a shot there Carson Palmer did trying to get JJ Nelson down the field but good coverage by Jermaine Brock over the top of this and you know you talk about wanting explosive plays this was a good decision by Carson Palmer the DB is in much better shape than his receiver so he's forced to throw it away five one nine five go my turn if I were to throw again away from larry fitzgerald breed making the ploy that time it's 1310 air creek could play man he is at the guy the last meeting that they chose to match up on larry fitzgerald because of the size you know Larry's huge eric reid is athletic enough to play on tight ends and on bigger wide receivers when you have a guy this versatile you could do a lot on the defense i know they're trying to play him at a lot of different spots that was a good play there looks like Ronnie help me count seven defensive backs for the 49ers maybe they'll play read in that like linebackers yeah as you tell me in your notes but they is very deep one of those safeties on third and ten on the intercepted disconnect our buyer agreed but a ball that should have been caught slide JJ Nelson good concentration here man Eric Reid is covering David Johnson and David Johnson streaking down the sideline but tips and overthrows that's why if your DB to get an interception and good play by Eric Reid you're right though Chris that should have been a complete JJ Nelson had have hit hit the pads secured the ball another takeaway for the 49ers defense that is three eats at a and in good field position at the 40 trailing by seven for Carson Palmer that was only his seventh interception this season and again his fall hide remains in the backfield for San Francisco carried nine times for 27 yards his lost yardage on Terrence Kaepernick here's loose and convert it goes out of bounds around the 30 slippery very slippery colin kaepernick is his pockets been collapsing around him all day long and Colitis Campbell does a great job look at that height just swims at the garden thought he's down there he thought Marcus golden had a chance there but an athlete that can run it's always dangerous he picked up nine growing for the end zone and Quentin packing just never really developed Patrick Peterson you don't usually want to go in that area you can help it I wasn't saying I mean I don't I don't know that we've called his name all days sitting out there at left corner don't try that it still try that again and if you were wondering it's ruled uncatchable so that's why there was no flag but facing a third and one from the 31 kaepernick for curly he makes the catch first down out of bounds inside the 28 of Arizona fake conversion there in second short it's almost always a shot play and they took the shot knowing that they trusted themselves to go for it on third actually they probably would have went for it on fourth down I think if they want to convert their Chip Kelly shown willingness to do that a couple of times already today see the numbers on Kaepernick he came in barely a 52% past completion mark this year Bullock incomplete Chris Harper it was just added off the Patriots practice squad from California after Keshawn Martin was released and they did not connect this is a laser Chris Martin Christa he got catch that right that was head Carper I'm sorry Chris Harper's gonna come down with that ball Shawn's Rome make that Dewan Harris in the backfield on second down ten he gets the football has some blocks there's a flag there's another flag and goes out the bowels of the toilet over offense number 88 your company check it down right here and yes this is a hole trying to set that edge give your runner some room but he had his hands tucked inside that's easy call for that profissional there and for a team that we remind everybody every week how they are a few his team penalized but boy today and they have had some big ones in rough spots that's the seventh penalty over 80 yards of penalties and so second and 20 from the 38 that one a good room there's a flag down again down to the 20yard line holy now some of that that's on center Daniel Kilgore you got to know where Kaepernick is going and what's going on back there just watch them I thought it was good here it's working off the doubleteam they don't usually call holes but that's close that was close yeah I didn't really see that I mean I know that's the flag came in right away the official behind thought he saw exactly what he saw but I'm not so sure about that one but anyways San Francisco now second 30 it's hard to get back on schedule from this down in distance wouldn't be surprised to see them just try to get 510 yards here trying to get in field goal range as dapper net keeps going on that's exactly right upmost importance now if you're 49ers it is to protect the football don't take chances moving it down the field and potentially take away a scoring opportunity because we know it Phil Dawson could do if he gets its he's gonna need maybe 10 12 yards for Dawson to have a legitimate chance at a fuel goal tried for Quentin patent edits fourth down and too long here it'd be a sixty plus even though we're indoors Chip Kelly don't want that happening in a one score game so the punter Bradley pinion trots out could take advantage of that take away good field position and um way behind where they were the turnover half at the backtoback holding penalties pushed him the other way Peterson back fair catch called for on the pucks around the 12yard line of arizona but the second half which has been a sore spot for the 49ers not so bad today but though they trail by seven in Arizona bucks Saturday in the pac12 Arizona State Sun Devils taking on the fourth ranked Huskies although that'll change coverage 7:00 Eastern 4:00 Pacific see it live or a Fox Sports go plenty of upsets a landslide of upsets mister there on college football Carson Palmer as USC Trojans with a big win over Washington fresh from the target the 49ers did they make it adjustment here from the first half Ronda as to why this defense seems to be doing a better job keeping the Cardinals from moving the ball well much like Arizona's had issues throwing and catching the football at times they're going through a slow spell right now and yes you've got to give credit to the San Francisco because they're stopping a run forcing Cardinals to throw the ball third long situation and they're getting off the field so a much improved performance today from Jim O'Neill's defense carson palmer looks one way throws to fitzgerald the other way short on the 20yard line will bring up third down carson palmer did not start the first game between these teams back in a week five but he is coming off backtoback 300yard passing performances even though they lost to Carolina he did throw for three touchdowns in that game on over 360 yards he's nearing 280 at this point it looks like the Cardinals are willing to let this thing run out and take it to the fourth quarter Arizona with a seven point lead and the football over the 49ers that's the end of three we're glad you're watching the NFL on Fox disguise does the defending champs to the NFC West the Arizona Cardinals off the bye week trying to get their record to four four and one 49ers hanging in there on the road trying to end a seven game losing skid 55 yards from scrimmage for David Johnson today mr. Fitzgerald who's been busy widening for that first now let's see he doesn't like the spot I don't like the spot I thought he got that fall over that line to gain there I mean you're a talented player but there's no substitute for effort as a great effort played by Larry Fitzgerald this is a guy who's been beat up all day with sore ribs a sore knee and came in with a sore ankle I mean if they want to challenge I throw it here well the officiating crew is discussing it so maybe he's getting some help from referee Brad Alice's first down so what they should do when somebody's not sure somebody has a better angle yes there and they're more intelligent together good job but look at where we go with it six foot three Freeman's knew where he had to go every possession vital in a one score game just very reliable when you need a catch when you need the big catch the tough catch it's gonna go to Larry Fitzgerald it's it's just the way this office has always been in his new role not new role now anymore under Bruce's office he gets so many of those opportunities not so much down the field anymore but he's gonna work for you you needed 10 catches 99 yards for Fitzgerald and that's David Johnson trying to stiff arm he gets to the 31 with that catch it's got a game break and check in with Kirk benefits for the first time today the Dallas Cowboys have the lead at Pittsburgh dak Prescott hooking up with Dez Bryant 50 yards for Bryant 116 yards receiving and that touchdown playing the day after his father passed away 23:18 right now Dallas for the lead Chris Ron named Jeff Thank You Curt the standings of the NFC's with the redskins winning today Giants have the Bengals Monday night David Johnson yeah there's just not been the right we've seen other teams open up against this 49er DSS again I think it's the number of snaps they're not playing right they're only at 45 or 50 some snaps on defense and that's that's good it's last week they had I mean all considerations I think they were high 70s it's snap count and it's just too much but yes again reiterate Steve Fitz is playing much better day they got a third one here heavy package for the car goes on offense see if they turn around hand this thing off if they try some trickier to get out of popular Carson Palmer David Johnson did not look like he got there Antoine pate made a great play here man right here watch some summer reading this play takes out the legs of the runner and he's definitely short of that line a game good job a kid by this San Francisco defense Antoine Bethea a Pro Bowler a Super Bowl champ when he was with the Colts closing in on a thousand career tackles and frustration for both Carson Palmer and Bruce Arians they are aggressive offensive minds and all I give them the ball back here under 12 and a half to play well they're leaving San Fran in the game you know this is the game if you're a Cardinal Cardinal fan Cardinal player you come in feel like you have to win this thing but right now defense of the 49ers is giving them a chance Jeremy Kerley with the fair catch on the punt at the 26 yard line where the 49ers take over trailing by seven today's game is sponsored by Audi see exceptional offers on select models during the season about e sales event and by Burger King now get three large pancakes for all the 89 cents only at Burger King Tyrann Mathieu the honey badger out with the shoulder injury Tony Jefferson swear injure in for Matthew Jefferson no those are the surprise when he heard the the partners of the number one defense in the league statistically is five he's brought down by that defense we want to know why they have the number one defense in the league is because of this just guys running into the backfield making plays this defense just flies around they're so talented up front you talk Callay is Campbell and all these other guys and it's Mauro who you don't hear much about but he's made a bunch of plays in the backfield today miRNA hit a crowd catch made but not good enough for the first down my Jeremy Kerley yet with tired Matthew out of the football game it's DJ swear injure Tony Jefferson I think Chris having a great season by all metrics and he's been a very reliable defender and have to play a bigger role those two safeties today with the honey badger out with that shoulder injury on third and one maybe up to this horizontal defense tonight to get them to 500 carlos hyde and here comes the flag ladies as he fought to get what looked like was enough for the first down holding penalties crushed Chip Kelly's team last time on offense I don't know what this penalty is this flag came from way out of the back of the secondary holding the play is the first down he literally CDs it's hard to even when even when it happens but even when it does happen it's hard to find tough yards for hide good enough for the first down that's amazing I thought he they would be more productive running the football today with Carlos ID he's certainly got fresh legs but Duan Harrison the football game now he's been a spark for this offense last couple of weeks he can get him involved here Kaepernick's throw and complete floor rod streeter it'll be second down the watt Harris played last week of the 60 offensive snaps he was in for 53 of them and really showed off a burst of energy all staccato football and took it in for a touchdown of 47 yards the free agent from Troy is kicked around teams as the second round pick from ohio state books on mike davis is inactive for this game he had the fumble the costly fumble in the second half last week for San Francisco Paris fights hard to get to the 41 another big third down for San Francisco we've talked about some of their futility Chris and I during that during that last break they only scored 16 points all year in the third quarter they've been a little bit better in the fourth quarter but they gotta find a way to sustain drives that get a first down here Kaepernick with a bullet and he held on to it in the crowd Jeremy Kerley will the first out catches he came in as the leading receiver but it cooled when they made the change from capper it's a Kaepernick really good throw that was a really good throw nice catch in traffic to by curly Curly's sixth catch of the game to lead all 49er receivers kaepernick fakes to hide after getting a cup only Jefferson it was a free agent after this year having a career year ran him out of bounds there were times on tampered nickel get that kind of play and it would be gone and just I don't know that he slowed down I know you know it wasn't healthy much the offseason had a bunch of those surgeries or whatnot is only in his fourth game back but I almost suspect he gets an edge that he's just gonna explode but they haven't seen it since he's been back starting quarterback those numbers go with 8 rushes for 32 yards Falls forward pushing his way to about the 47 will still bring us a third now one thing that 49ers are doing is they're chewing up the clock yeah and more importantly keeping their defense off the field he put themselves in these third medium situations though and so far it's been Curley who showed up to get some timely catches he's in the slot up top see Colin Kaepernick decides to go to his main receiver again rush are coming had to get rid of it early and went and Patton on the sideline out of bounds even though he hauled in the pass close but definitely out of balance just as Beppo again coverage he's the guy that is having to play with tired Matthew out they needed another DB to come in on these passing situations so it's been Bethel and Kelly encouraging his quarterback Patrick Peterson standing at the 10 with a kid fair catch call for a that's a go when it sticks and it's down inside the five Marcus Cromartie getting down there as Peterson opted to let it go the forty niners hanging in there on the road in Arizona Cardinals have the football with just over eight to play disputing an improvement you've talked about whether they score or not it certainly helps the defense talk about the number of snaps that talk about the depth of this roster they just don't have it so being on the field that long just never really works out for carson palmer from his own end zone a low throw but the catch made Jermaine Gresham his fourth catch of the game a healthy pickup on first down there's the old Bruce Arians Carson Palmer not afraid to throw from their own goal line now they got to get out of the shadow here I mean a drive here for Arizona you know could be somewhat of a killer to this game 49ers backed up situation still got a chance to keep it down here been playing pretty good so far today David Johnson can he get the first down there's a flag down he goes down in a hurry and he didn't even get Eli Harold led the charge near the first down marker that's a hold against the 40 she's meeting it's the Cardinals you know you know what something happening today they're doing a really good job watching Eli here over here doing a good job setting the edge of the defense Jim O'Neill told me that's where they've been failing and that's where the hold is really not giving the runner an opportunity to stretch the ball to the boundary and good job by these two outside linebackers today doing their job better than they have in the past couple of weeks ball spotted just beyond the seven yard line David Johnson on suckin down goes down it'll be third now they need to get up near the just short of the 15yard line to get the first down well you came into this game thinking just turn around hand the ball to David Johnson watch them do what everybody else has done well not so fast Arizona this is 49ers defense glint Dorsey on that play just really stepping up their game here and to be successful I'm a I played on a lot of good defenses and we had good past defenders of good linebackers or whatnot but it always starts up front they tell them to three yards to carry there were people talking about David Johnson having a 200 yard rushing day against this 49er defense that tipping point third and five person Palmer gets rid of it and incomplete there's a down holding defense numbers 25 fiveyard penalty automatic first down Jimmy Wars done a lot of good things today but you gotta you got to play with your hands here your feet not your hands here see him with his eyes in the backfield he's trying to I the quarterback as well as covered McMahon you just can't do that only a couple penalties against Arizona look with the 49ers have lost yardage wise a hundred yards and penalties and a fresh set of downs for Bruce Arians that big they had where they wanted backed up gonna have to punt get favorable field position instead to get a first down still falling John Brown and I'm down short of the 25yard line he had a lot of space out there I mean Eric Reid Eric Reid was covered him from the other side of the field had to run through some to wash up his defense and and that looked like it could have been a huge huge play good hustle play by Eric Reid you'll see him right here to the side of your screen running around his linebackers and if John Brown breaks that tack he's got a blocker out front with Michael Floyd that would have been a enormous game they picked up ten o'clock running five and a half to go they've adjusted up first down strong push across the 31yard line david johnson when you talk about how to describe him I know the 49ers have done a a nice job we heard everything from a little Marshall Faulk a little Edgerrin James Bruce Arians said sometimes he runs like Marcus Allen he can catch the ball I can't compare him to anybody I've not seen a guy run like heat like he does he's got this little even know what it is like a stutter headed hesitation in his running style that puts defenders on edge and stops their feet he just runs around them he's good man he's really good and a strong pickup on first down again but it'll be third down not that coming off the games that we've done with San Francisco past couple of days you wouldn't you never would never think we've come into this game saying you can't run the ball against these guys but right now you cannot run the ball against these guys 49er defense allowing an average of 37 points a game heading into the halfway point of the season and they've held the explosive Cardinals to 20 another big third down opportunity to stop here Arizona wants his clock to keep ticking old minutes left in this game this is a personal crucial stop needed stop for San Fran mom are throwing the only each three yards for Fitzgerald who has it on a first down he's over a hundred yards with his eleventh catch of the game this is his about is guaranteed is anything good throw it was a natural pick set up by the outside receiver that's a 50/50 ball throw it up to 11 let your future halloffame receiver make the tough catch on third down and for Carson Palmer third straight 300 yard game his fourth this season it's deceptive Gerald Hodges with the pic and he's still going carson palmer's done this a couple of times this year when I've watched it film locks in on a receiver watched Gerald Hodges number 51 read his eyes the whole way coming in behind him fourth takeaway for the San Francisco defense and the second interception of the season for Gerald Hodges switch to the network go for unlimited ena 49ers have a four take away game against Carolina on the road earlier this year they have for today and a big one Kaepernick throwing Oakland curly and he stayed in a part of the official yes he it's at the 35 of Arizona the last week I thought colin kaepernick did a great job throwing a football out of the pocket and this is a tough throw moving to his left delivers a bullet look at the spiral on that and a fantastic catch they wanted to snap it quickly in case that extra foot there was a review too late now at the three minute mark let's go back to throwing on first down you saw in case you were wandering Bruce Arians said hey was my bad on Carson Palmer he calls the plays and that led to the turnover with the Hodges interception yeah I think he got a little impatient you know that trying to run the clock out obviously but they haven't been able to run the football you would think he'd just turn and hand it off but got a little impatient a play caller did San Francisco exploded took advantage of it got another take away I had to fall a great position now Kaepernick should have been caught it was a low throw but Tory Smith might have been able to score oh my goodness Torrey Smith gotta catch this football now gotta catch this football this was moments ago after the interception thrown by Carson Palmer now the defense it's up to the Arizona defense for the name for Catherine they bringing the extra pressure picked up he can run for the first down and he does down the sidelines Kaepernick there's the first to expect from Kaepernick out of the pocket and Peleus Campbell there's no chance to stop him there you know the end of the day when you have a quarterback like this you want to give him these opportunities told me again he likes playing with green grass in front of him because he has the option to throw it to a receiver uses godgiven ability and run for a big first down there he picked up 19 he's the leading rusher for the 49ers in today's game averaging over five and a half a karat first down from the 12 of Arizona timeout and the 49ers used one of theirs they'll have two remaining plus the twominute warning Arizona has not allowed a touchdown after halftime in its last three games there's a defensive coordinator hoping to make it four first down San Fran's got a drive here which one of these defenders much talented group on defense is gonna stand up make a play here and win his football game Torrey Smith who had the big drop is in motion Kaepernick had the big run for the endzone just a little long for Carlos high just out of the reach if he had floated that a little bit more hide was opened yeah chip knew it good route combination he came all the way out of the backfield to be a receiver there and man got your best plays drawn up you get in the red zone obviously this is for down territory for San Francisco Chip Kelly looking at that play car he's trying to figure out a way for this offense to get the end zone here keep an eye on his tight ends it didn't wild for for colin kaepernick Dwan Harrison the game and running back Kapernick rolls that way throws to his tight end pants McDonald bowling over some people gets inside the five and that should take us to the twominute warning short of the first down with two minutes to go Arizona protecting a sevenpoint lead but the 49ers are closing in I note the obvious different Reuben stack with corned beef limited time only small screens stadiumsized content watch live local sunday games on your smartphone with NFL Mobile well even though it's third and two this Cardinal defense blitz is more than anybody should they do that here I would be shocked if they didn't blitz they know they trust their defenders to play mantoman defense on the outside they do not care expect a lot of pressure and if you're Colin Kaepernick goodness Kaepernick in this offense I would say their guy gets a pocket movement put the ball in sevens hands let him make a decision he can run for a first down before a touchdown on 3rd and pressure coming he's turning the corner Kaepernick isn't the endzone for a touchdown San Francisco nothing James Beckster can do there great plate design by the 49ers they put all three receivers on the other side of the field they move in putting patent here to block the ads to protect the quarterbacks backside and then like I said give the ball to your best athlete on offense and make a play for you great play call Dale Buchanan came in blitzing but Kaepernick turned the corner on him and the extra point from 41 year old Phil Dawson to tie this game with 155 to go in the fourth and it's good two minute football every game not every game but most every game Chris comes down to this situation in the game and the Arizona Cardinals last year won a bunch of these games close games they want this year they've been in this situation and haven't found a way to get it done she got a really good player you got Larry Fitzgerald you have David Johnson see if they're able to go down and score game winning get a gamewinning score on this Drive well a field goal here or a field goal there they could have beaten New England and Seattle instead of ending up tied in that game but what a game for Fitzgerald 11 catches 118 yards but remember Carson Palmer called Michael Floyd the X Factor and he has been active in this game not lately because the Cardinals have scored nothing in the second half but he might be the goto guy here with under two to blitz well who could deal with the pressure best we know that they have those type of players on the Cardinals offense the question now you got to be asking yourself to the 49ers defense they have the gumption really to stand up here play the way they've been playing all day getting stops and hold this Cardinal offense down on this side of the field maybe even give themselves a chance to win it and Chandler Catanzaro may be sweating it out Ellingson from the one a big win for the 49ers special teams they put them inside the 15 well five early games decided by seven points or less and the afternoon games are tight the Eagles win a battle with the Falcons and Matt Ryan told you Green Bay lost at Tennessee Washington beat Minnesota Vikings at a tailspin the OT coming up after us with the gang all the highlights postgame comments Miami won in San Diego the Dolphins beat the Chargers have a big game against the Rams who won today Seattle plays tonight in the NFC West at New England Fitzgerald can't head with one handed its second in test so you got to be careful down here right you can be aggressive Ronde but a quick three and out and then you give the 49ers a chance of regulation to win you do not want that I would imagine your San Francisco your having two guys look at number 11 on this drive that time it was Jimmy war and Eric Reid bracketing Larry Fitzgerald he is the biggest threat and though Carson Palmer him have like a mind meld they're always on the same page about you screen right here Carson bomber in trouble for Floyd the inspector a spectacular catch and slow to get up good improvised play by Carson Palmer ridiculously good catch and I'm not sure how he held on to this after his head hit the ground here ruled a catch on the field under two to play we hope he's okay my friends think doing under two minutes it's an automatic booth review the officials doublechecking their call on the field that it was a catch by Michael Floyd who has helped over to the sideline after well I think it's call to catch on the field there's not a lot of conclusive evidence in the pictures that we saw the break this is the best picture that we got see the ball there he definitely hasn't Lee hits the ground but it's just not a lot to see for them to turn over turn this I think and Chip Kelly's reaction I think tells you what Brett Allen's going to say right now well it was a big play that Carson Palmer he's got Fitzgerald but he told us we watched him at practice after on Friday that Michael Floyd was a guy who he had confidence in despite what has gone on earlier in the year and when they needed it most a healthy pickup to the 41 at a first down two timeouts for each team three they have to remain five catches for floor and he's over a hundred yards along with Fitzgerald Carson Palmer underneath to David Johnson these forward falling at the 49 of Arizona clock continues to run technique time if you're on defense here don't try to do more than you always already have done all game long stick to what you've been doing patient come on make tackles Fitzgerald inside the 40 down to the 37 of San Francisco his 18th target today equaling his careerhigh they called a blitz and again when you pressure Carson Palmer hit mid Larry Fitzgerald almost always see the same thing on defense and he just hits his hits his hot receiver reliable toffee big catch big first down Chandler Catanzaro a mixed season it's been good today twice but three field goals missed including two in that 6 6 tie with Seattle Michael Floyd has checked back in Hindman Fitzgerald have combined for 233 yards of receiving today the Larry Fitzgerald is never going to wow you with numbers anymore as far as yards per catch I think he averaging less than ten yards a carry Bhargav I'm sorry completion the 12 catches 132 yards a man this guy is unbelievable Palmer sideline throw incomplete he was going to Floyd again Jimmy Ward on the coverage but when you get out of phase as a defensive back this is exactly how you play this deal you're beat you don't have time to look run through his hands with your hand does not interfere with them great play there's been some really good pass breakups by these 49er corners today another one they're muchneeded fortyniners heavy underdogs try on their seven games get going toetotoe with the defending champions of the NFC West and that's been the story all day with him on his 49er defense it'll be third down time out 49ers and Larry Fitzgerald what a day and we said coming in he's had a career against the 49ers left early had some bruised ribs hurt his knee 12 catches over a hundred thirty yards some key catches when they needed it spectacular catches him and Michael Floyd today Arizona right now I'm wondering are they playing for a field goal here with that run they're on second down so right now you're looking excuse me Ronde at about a 53yard field goal if they gain nothing the worst thing they want is a sack or a turnover here of your Arizona but I'm always you know you're looking you got a play call at a head coach on their sideline and Bruce Arians who likes to be aggressive it would surprise me if they play this safe turn around to hand the ball off and at some point you got to trust your offense the one that was so explosive last year to make an explosive play for you this year if they got going here if they got cooking on third eight count and Gerald has made a 60 yard field goal this season it's the longest in the NFL this year third na mama rolling and throwing and right on target David Johnson well here you go if you're Carson Palmer this is what you get to see you get to see 50 clearly covering your running back that is a mismatch of epic proportions spread out good ball first down David Johnson he is as good as a receiver would you line him up outside and they were playing mantoman and they had to match up they want big first now Nick velour couldn't stay with him five catches for David Johnson 46 yards to go with 48 yards on the ground after they pick up 12 Johnson straight ahead each team was just one timeout 49ers will use one here with Ronde Barber Chris Myers hope you're enjoying the NFL on Fox we mention the up and down season for jammer bizarro 47 yarder with 41 seconds left against New England and week 1 and over time he hit the left upright on a 26 yarder and I will tell you woulda won the game Mercer was also one block again he has made from 60 yards that was against Buffalo well the we're inside a 40 right now if they had to line up and kick it that week one miss is very similar to this they played for the field goal opportunity instead of trying to go for the score and it came back to haunt if they had a new snapper at that point and that was partly responsible for that mess inside the 15 49ers are out of timeouts it's a first down while trying to describe David Johnson this is it right here watch his moves in the hole the stuttered head is it hesitation feet are off the ground look at a jump cut right there back the other way he does so many things will he'll man for a young guy that's big strong quick feet it's awesome to watch him run the football sixteen seconds remain 87% career mark for Catanzaro he's made from 39 and 19 today well I tell you what to Chris all day they've been struggling running the football when they needed a big run offensive line finally stepped up your runner you're special very special unique runner makes a couple of good moves picks up some muchneeded yardage get you in field goal range enough ball carson palmer has to do get three spikes here make sure you're on the preferred feel of hash mark four can't 0 i'll go kick this field goal they swarm in on David Johnson's and they're gonna wait and call their last timeout so that the game will be won by Arizona on this kick or that's high game going to overtime after this game bonus coverage of the Cowboys in Pittsburgh that's when a back and forth game the Steelers leading that by one but only 30 seconds left their really good Drive here I mean you got to give credit to San Francisco everybody expected this to be a blowout of type of game their offense wasn't performing well the defense was getting run through but they stood up and to have a chance to win it at the end is the very impressive defense wasn't able to get to stop though 34 yards away for the win and the crowd in Arizona Larry Fitzgerald said we're capable of going on a winning streak",

  "transcript": "a little throughout the afternoon and now let's head down to the field and say hi and of Pam Oliver hey there grace well the smile never left his face when I talked to Paxton Lynch before the game he was relaxed and apparently well rested he told me he had no trouble sleeping in fact he slept great you got the impression that this moment is just not too big for him that he's prepared for it we'll see how cheering remains though with a bunch of big 300 defensive lineman heaps beggin sixfootseven the rookie getting his start the Broncos have won nine in a row using four different quarterbacks Lynch got into the game last week to finish up against Tampa Bay and Gary Kubiak has done a tremendous job of managing these quarterbacks from Peyton Manning Osweiler Simeon and now Paxton Lynch and Dan Quinn his team coming out on Friday they're gonna stay out west they have Seattle up next the first the defending Super Bowl champions to deal with now the Broncos won the toss deferred Eric Weems who was the last Falcon to have return to kickoff for a touchdown as Brandon McManus ready to kick it off week five Rocko's and falcons and this will sail into the end zone Matt Ryan will lead the offense starting from the 25yard line we mentioned the over 500 yard passing performance completing 72% of his passes and only two interceptions so far at Chris and what a difference a year makes year two in Kyle Shanahan his offensive coordinator system not only Matt Ryan but this entire offense looking much more in sync much more in rhythm they've been extremely impressive thus far and the running game has been solid as well with Devonta Freeman at 7 Coleman breem on the carry on first down gets a couple around a 28 yard line well when you look at these teams its strength against strength and we're talking about some of the strengths of the league you see the passer rating of matt ryan and the different broncos they play quarterbacks extremely tough yards per play tops of the league and then yards for completions 20th explosive plays Atlanta as explosive as anyone and the Denver Broncos they just don't give up explosive plays Julio Jones and lotion up second and seven Ryan the incomplete try to go to Jones Aqib Talib on the coverage they'll kick to leave early in this season plain as well as any corner that I've seen and he was really looking forward to this matchup with Julio Jones he matches Julio Jones extremely well in terms of side size and speed and a great play by to leave early in the game Broncos come in having scored over 40 points and backtoback aids make that the South is that the Broncos haven't allowed anybody to score more than 12 on 3rd and 7th three minutes a reciever top of your screen here comes a flag one of the Broncos jumped as the pass is completed to Mohamed Sanu good enough for a first down now in conventional wisdom Philly's decline first out dimensional wisdom would say advantage Broncos with the crowd noise but Matt Ryan anyhow goes with the hard count draws Shane ray off and then completes the pass so tremendous job of handling the noise early by Matt Ryan and the Falcons offense after a pickup of 10 Tevin Coleman checks in at running back that's him moving to the slot to the right of Ryan from the 30 Ryan with time and dumps it across the middle and that's Coleman still going seven Coleman runabout sits at the 20 of the Broncos a catch and carry that sets up the Atlanta offense 48 yards this is something we talked about it Julio Jones 12 catches last week 300 yards but Matt Ryan will spread the football including to his running backs this is something you don't see often TJ Ward and the Denver Broncos missing tackles in space it's something they pride themselves on but Coleman breaks the tackle for the big game all the way down to the 15yard line is Freeman jutsu plenty of time for met Ryan it opened inside the ten Daponte Freeman gets down around the oneyard line what a job of Atlanta coming out poised Matt Ryan sitting back finding the open receiver and it's going to be Devonta Freeman their running back working against the inside backer and then again making good yardage in space without a huddle to the line Freeman has it that he goes nowhere Chris this is something we're both often stood today that wide zone type running scheme down near the goal line that can struggle because it's sidetoside it's not getting off the ball and powering at people and so you'll often look for Kyle Shanahan to try to go to some kind of gadget play down here rather than hammering it straight ahead Falcons in the red zone the best there is they actually lost a yard on second and goal cleanin out as a receiver top of your screen on the roll heeds it and get rid of it for what much there's von miller put some pressure on that line a really nice job in coverage see Talib and brandon marshall Brandon Marshall sees the formation sprint right option played that a lot of teams go to down here he's all over it brings up a big third down Wade Phillips coordinating this defense that has been dominat third and goal Brian ends own cloth but he can't get in right at the goal line what a tackle on Jacob Tamme Todd Davis wouldn't let him get across the goal line and what a great job by Todd Davis Matt Ryan's gonna find Tammy but then look at the struggle does not get it across the playing great job by Davis Dan Quinn doesn't hesitate to send these guys out there they're going for it on fourth down three tight ends around Falcons Freeman has it touchdown Atlanta Devonta Freeman following his walk into the endzone I can't say enough about this drive you're going up against the defending Super Bowl champs watch Patrick DeMarco right here the fullback clear the way good block on Dakota Watson that gets enough space for Freeman but Chris that's a bigtime Drive you're coming to the defending Super Bowl champ who prides himself on defense and you take the ball the long way all the way down the field and then punch it in on fourth down and going for it on fourth down Matt Bryant to try the 33 yard extra point and it's good Rockets going for their fourth straight win against the unbeaten Broncos and the Vontae Freeman on Atlanta's opening drive it's the Falcons of seven nothing lead with John Lynch Chris Myers Matt Ryan's four out of six on that drive a 75yard Drive interesting that the Broncos at home deferred challenging the top scoring offense in the NFL and the Falcons respond no NFL kickoff this season has been returned for a touchdown that yet late in Week five on this one no chance 25 yard line for the rookie Paxton Lynch who when he got in last week against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers he led him to three scoring drives no turnovers but the number one pick out of Memphis and the Broncos traded up five spots to get him there confident putting him in this position well they sure are I mean they love what Trevor Simeon it's been doing and they gave Trevor Simeon every chance to play his shoulder just was not ready but you can see as I said in the open the excitement because this kid has given them a lot to be excited about CJ Anderson and maybe a yard Brooks read on the tackles Donald Stevenson and Virgil green tackling tight ends still inactive for the Broncos they were hoping to have them back to help that running game get going and the Falcons taking advantage of linebackers beat up for their top linebackers injured out of this game Paul Worrell Deion Jones on second and nine Anderson that far but just short of the 30yard line Anderson comes in averaging three and a half yards to carry ran the ball early well with the last few not so much well you'd look at Keon O'Neill this is Dan Quinn from the Seattle Seahawks he was a coordinator there they went out they tried to find their version of camp Chancellor and they found Keon O'Neill he's a rookie their firstround pick they love what he's doing and I do as well watching him and rookie Devante Booker is in and running back blitz his dad completed to Emmanuel Sanders we're gonna be saying this a lot when you watch this young man throw the football it's just pretty you see Emmanuel Sanders doing a great job setting up the route running to the corner but just a beautifully thrown ball by Paxton Lynch see the height but he's got all the arm strength you could ever ask for but the thing I love he throws a very catchable ball and he's very good at having touch as well as the strong arm after a pickup of 49 the rookie javante butcher the running back looking for some room gets up to around the 48 yard line that's six seven facts and what he didn't say John it was invaluable getting in that game getting that first throw in in a regular season game last week well no doubt about it he had some nerves he was in on a third down welcome to the NFL when Simeon was hurt but the biggest thing those reps and then the reps this week in practice Gary Kubiak let him take most of the first team reps he just hasn't had that thus far that's what he needs his reps Trevor Simeon they made a late decision Saturday to have him an active Austin Davis the backup by the way and Paxton Lynch incomplete he is full back Janovich the target well Chris you talk about challenges and you think you know it's about defense alignment coming at you it's about coverages the speed of the game and talking to Paxton Lynch his biggest huddle right here in the huddle because he never was in a huddle in high school and or at at Memphis they did not huddle he played in a spread offense so the huddle along with the verbage it's much more vast in the NFL and that's been his biggest challenge we'll have to explore that more on 3rd and 7 in comes the pass rushing specialist white Freeney Lynch a little hot rule that might have been almost intercepted around the 40 a little bit of an overthrow before Goodwin CJ Goodwin didn't come up with it but there was pressure coming from the outside on Lynch one of the things Simeon has been doing so so well as he's been highly accurate now you bring in Paxton Lynch a little nerves and we saw the last two footballs little errant in his delivery Erik Weems back to receive the punt of Riley Dixon fair catch wait for at the 12 yard line at a flag down Terry McCauley is our referee today pointing against the Broncos that pot 39 yards without a return now this may be an option if you want to tack it on during the kick personal foul face mask kicking team number 50 15yard penalty will be added to the end of the play first down timeout Jair Anderson fall for the infraction of LeBron goes the historymaking combination that riot and Julio Jones last week what are they going to do today for an encore you take a look at that last punt and there's AI air Anderson on Austin Hooper and you see it right there he's got a hand of his facemask the officials right on it that will be moved them up to the 28 yard line on first down Coleman gets across the 30 in that last series Bryan completing passes to his running backs Coleman and Freeman and then setting up the touchdown by the way the Lions beat the Eagles John so lonely the Broncos and the Vikings are undefeated in the NFL at the moment Minnesota Vikings on my goodness have they been impressive losing Adrian Peterson their starting quarterback and still undefeated on second down Tevin Coleman has room to get another first down shut back right at the marker you see the Atlanta Falcons and Patrick DeMarco he just sees the eyes for the fullback there he opens up the hole tremendous job of reaching everybody else you see Chester on Derek wolf and Tevin Coleman doing a nice job getting up field falcons showing tremendous poise and execution against a great defense early on pickup evade it is a first down just short of the 39 yard line : faked to him Matt Ryan with time and that's DeMarco the fullback who gets him to Braco territory with another first down well it's pretty clear that the matchup Matt Ryan is like thus far is his running backs against the inside linebackers of the Denver Broncos there's Todd Davis DeMarco does a great job it looks like run to Todd Davis and then he leaks out and Matt Ryan it's an athletic catch by a fullback if he's running backs really hurting the Denver Broncos in the pass game pickup of 13 at the 48 yard line of the Broncos Coleman again better call straight at the middle and gets down around the 33 yard line of Denver I love what Kyle Shanahan is doing because you think about the strength of this Denver Broncos defense to me it's on the edges it's their outside linebackers their corners so where can you hit them you can hit them right up the gut you run right at them that's exactly what they're doing they're doing it with great efficiency Kyle Shanahan calling a great game thus far he's had an outstanding year as an offensive coordinator you talk about quarterbacks being hot he's hot as a flake collar right now after a 15yard quick Oh Matt Ryan nice interception there's a key Toledo on a couple last week stepping in front of the receiver Pete to lead one of the highest football IQs I've ever seen he really understands route concepts he rarely misses a ball that's one of the great things he has are tremendous hands played some receiver at the University of Kansas he's got nine defensive touchdowns in his career this guy can catch the ball smart player keep the leap Levante freeman comes in at second and ten he gets the carry and in Pullman I've been impressive here as he goes down around the 31 yard line you mentioned Kyle Shanahan at age 36 that Gary Kubiak said he was around me when he was a kid and then he was my receivers coach and quarterback coach and offensive coordinator we know each other well yeah one thing about Kyle Shannon and a lot of people I think God thought he got in because his father was in the league but look at the production you can't argue with it he's been a lot of different places and he's had success everywhere and the Bronco fans knows mike shanahan Boman as a receiver top of your screen on 3rd and 8th Matt light his hat time so far extra pressure picked up and on the move he completes the julio jones of flag flies as jones gets down to the 11th of denver they're actually gonna call off it's a PI on Julio we saw the separation there's who I think that's a good call by the officials when you get extended as a wide receiver it's okay to have contact but when you get extended the back judge that's exactly what he's watching the back judge was all over it and a good call will push against Chris Harris and it changes things dramatically because now Atlantis backed up to the 41 and it's third and 18 a time out Atlanta right now you're looking at what would be a 59yard fuel goal try if they go for that option remember they went on fourth and short when they were down around the goal line dan Quinn a defensive minded coach but he's got the hottest offense in the league right now through four weeks this offense has been redhot you see 479 yards per game 38 points won't leave the league you see the dynamic duo right there leading their respective positions in the NFL and then the running backs they can run the football as well I think that's the xfactor in this game not only their highflying offense to see Julio Jones out gaining 23 teams last week on his own but not only do they do that they spread the ball they run the ball this is a complete office I had a bedspread like that one I guess you call it a comforter now third at 18 the fourman rush Ryan middle of the field and Freeman is open for a gainer inside the 30 won't get the first down but it sets up a better field goal try really good job I mean against this defense you don't want to try to force the ball instead get some yards to help Matt Bryan out and I think the big deal look at the protection they've been very solid and protection all day that's a nice pocket you dump it off to Freeman and make it easier for your kicker Matt Brian Matt Bryant eight of eight in the field goal Department his long is 53 this will be from 46 in the altitude of mile high and that is right down the middle and attend nothing Atlanta Falcon leads the Atlanta offense comes out swinging for head coach Dan quill Falcons ready to kick off here in Denver they've had the ball for just over eight minutes compared to just two and a half and that makes you put it gas for some oxygen even when you're the home team I mean the Falcons you could not be more impressed with the way they've kind of said hey we're here to play we're gonna think we're not here just to get trounced by the defending champs and they've planned like it Matt Bosher bothered by the hamstring who also does the punting good enough to do the kickoff the go today so from the 25yard line Maxim which goes back to work trailing like dead Gregg Knapp quarterbacks coach sends in the play to the rookie Paxton Lynch member of the audio shuts off 15 seconds before the play clock in his first NFL start Lynch one out of three so far pressure coming and he's going to go down fortunate to hang out of the football as Vic Beasley got into Sacko well you know we talk about the vaunted pass rush for the Denver Broncos but Vic Beasley who's been struggling along with the Atlanta Falcons the least sacks in the league coming in he's got a rookie quarterback he holds on to the ball and Vic Beasley goes ahead and gets his second sack of the season for the Atlanta Falcons and that's only the fifth sack for this Atlanta defense CJ Anderson find something they're brought down shore to the 24 yard line so you look at Paxton Lynch and we talk about all his talent but there's a reason that Gary Kubiak went with Trevor Simeon it was a comfort level you could throw the entire scheme at him and coming to from the college game particularly when you never huddled you played in a spread there's a lot of adjustments and I think we're seeing some of that right now the Atlanta Falcons who have struggled on defense most of this year are giving it to the Denver Broncos extra pressure events there's a flag down in the backfield as he runs that's up across the 35 looks like it's good enough for a first down pending the flag it will use a pencil faceoff that's number 79 down that call on right guard Michael Scofield let's go field working right up there and you see the hands all over I think that's claybournes facemask and Paxton Lynch had scrambled for the first out so a big penalty for Michael Scofield and the differ Bronk was setting up an even longer third down now they need to get 21 yards on scouts had him rated one of the most athletic quarterbacks coming out of college the six seven packs of the wrench but what will Gary Kubiak get from his rookie now under the middle of Demaryius Thomas for blockers that we won't go very far it will bring up fourth down let's get a game break and coming into week five Broncos facing the fourth down punting to Weems from his 30 with a block picks up seven before he's met hard and pushed back the Falcons offense highlytouted coming into this game but so far the defense has held up rather well falcons have the firt of the football just over two minutes remaining in the opening quarter they have been dominat um they came in averaging seven and a half yards to play offensively best in the league and they've done better than that so far seven Coleman we're its attacker here comes a flag as he got up to the 43 yard line Bryan Schrader called for the penalty little negate that game but again even with the penalty Chris I think we're seeing Atlanta really controlling the line of scrimmage and then breaking a lot of tackles this is the thing that's surprising me typically you turn on the film and that Broncos tackle as well as any defense in this league they're not tackling well and you got to give some credit to the Falcons they're breaking those tackles today but the penalty backs them up to their own 27 on first down at 25 different receivers so far Ryan has thrown the ball to none has been Julio Jones that's incomplete he hesitated look I think the pocket was slowly giving way we talked about five different receivers targeted none including Julio Jones and I think that's really made them a lot of bet a lot better this year and you talk about year two that was a point of emphasis let's not forcefeed Julio Jones he's a great talent a great receiver and Matt Ryan was really proud of last week 12 catches 300 yards for Julio he said I didn't force one ball to him I went where the progression told me to go they want earlier this year when Julio Jones just had one catch against New Orleans to leave is on Julio Jones second and 20 Ryan spins out of the pocket side the 15 in Atlanta just a tremendous job of coverage downfield giving Shane ray the outside linebacker in for DeMarcus Ware part of being a pass rushers just being relentless gets knocked to the ground twice literally crawls to the legs of Matt Ryan really nice effort by Shane ray the secondyear player the 18 sack for the NFL's best in that department look Broncos now what Brian into plate it's fourth down it's obvious but against the defense like this the selfinflicted wounds just kill you instead of an eightyard gain on first down the penalty by Schrader takes them back and not only was it a three and out now you also have the crowd now into the game and it feels like some momentum for the Denver Broncos we see if Paxton Lynch in the offense can capitalize Matt Bosh are we mentioned the hamstring that bothered him throughout the week Jordan Norwood back to return averaging more than 10 yards to return this Susan foster gets it out of there and a good kick Norwood back to the 26 September at wounds on they hang time for eight he got up across the 40 where the Bronco offensive Paxton Lynch will take over little surprised with what we've seen so far the 10 nothing scored well I don't think surprised I mean the Atlanta Falcons have been really good we're I'm surprised defensively they got all their linebackers hurt but yet they're going up against a rookie quarterback and they're giving them a lot of fits right now the defense is playing well I expected the offense for Atlanta even against this defense to be able to move the ball now we're going to see Ken Paxton Lynch quiet down his nerves and go start completing some of these passes that he's been missing best field position for the rookie quarterback so far today John is at the 43 of Denver extra pressure coming up the middle but it's picked up and Lynch odd target at the 40 Emmanuel Sanders first of all it always starts with protection just a great job of protecting but this is that arm telling I'm talking about just rare arm strength that's a long throw coming on a line in a manual Sanders says thank you very much Paxton I'll take that a gain of 17 Sanders the leading receiver on the team of CJ Anderson gets inside the 35 yard line of Atlanta and the opening quarter has come to a close the redhot Falcons have a tending advantage over the reigning Super Bowl champs but the Broncos are on the move after one John Lynch Pam Oliver chrismyers hope you're enjoying the NFL on Fox with Paxton Lynch at his first NFL start trailing said nothing as the second quarter begins but at the 34 of Atlanta on a second down they need to get to the 30 CJ Anderson gets close and a bring a third and short Atlanta defense helding helped held up well come on smile a safety taking in the defensive signals today trying to help out with the injury well I think it's really smart you see Ricardo Allen there but you look at the linebackers for their top 5 out kamal Esmail pass Paxton Lynch isn't the only guy new to calling signals in a huddle a smile typically a safety playing linebacker today as a result if I'm offense Gary Kubiak tests them in the run game the run Fitz are tough when you haven't played linebacker before CJ Anderson all I needed was less than a yard Grady Jared shoved him back its fourth down and they're gonna go for it just like Atlanta course when Atlanta went for it they were at the goal line and produced a touchdown great job of penetrating by Grady Jarrett getting in that backfield gary kubiak knows he's facing a highscoring Atlanta team and want to give him the ball back CJ Anders from the running back worse they could just try and draw him offside we have a timeout Atlanta calls time I don't they had enough defensive players out on the field they did have ten guys and when you look at remember all the linebackers hurt Phillip wheeler one of the linebackers wasn't on the field you talked about a rookie calling plays and understanding the verbage John it's so different if any of us realized calling up a play in college how it sounds like and compared to the NFL we never went to a huddle but then look at this there's a signature play at Memphis 120 East now you get to the NFL here he goes into a huddle far west right slot a right 3:22 scat why stick slop slop is part slant and one slant option oh okay that's a mouthful it's hard for me to say it and I'm reading it accident Lynch he's been practicing in front of the mirror because he doesn't get the rep so he said look the hardest part for me right now is the huddle once I get through there I feel good whatever he calls out yeah hey he was reading it off to himself at home he only needs a yard the fullback Janovich gets the first down for the Broncos whatever we called there came out right for the Broncos well I I call this slop when you give the ball to a fullback that's slop and Andy Janovich although he showed us that he can run the ball opening week going for a long touchdown against the Carolina Panthers but that's just straight that's like his Memphis play just got in there said slop come on Janovich a good job by Gary Kubiak in the Denver Broncos converting on that fourth down sixth round draft pick for rookie from Nebraska the fullback now is Avante Booker resume and Lynch on the rollout getting pressure he slips out of a tackle and then goes out of bounds rooks read playing like his hair's on fire he is but this again great play by Reed but look at the athleticism of Paxton Lynch escaping Brooks read the coverage downfield what happened Emmanuel Sanders slipped at the end of that play Paxton Lynch evades Brooks Reed and turns a sack into some positive yardage and that's the athleticism this kid asked second down seven that three out of all that already in field goal range Lynch throws and incomplete cuts a flag and it's on Robert Alford with Demaryius Thomas Alfred has seen his share of flags over the last couple of years defense number 23 automatic first down Robert Alford is a very talented corner working against a Marius Thomas he has a bad habit of always wanting to grab he doesn't trust his own speed and I don't know why for the life of me because he can fly but this has been a problem for him you see 30 penalties since 2013 it's been a problem they've tried to address it he just hasn't fixed it other than that he's a really good corner in this league first time from the 18 Lynch has time high and incomplete he's trying to go to Booker in the middle of the field it's a dangerous throw high across the middle in this league usually turns in interceptions because it's tips and overthrows is this nerves because he's throwing higher his 67 height his feet aren't set and when your feet aren't set the rest of it doesn't work and I think even when you're 6 7 that's more of a problem you've got more margin for errors so Paxton when I talked to him in preseason it's always about the feet for him getting his feet set when you do that everything else follows Dwight Freeney in Booker gets the handoff and come on Ishmael came up playing like a linebacker from that safety spot or something like that now I don't know what what he's playing linebacker safety but that's a heck of a tackle and you're gonna see him flashing you screen and there he is playing linebacker and looking like a linebacker flowing finding the ball and then attacking great job by Ishmael getting in their backfield taking the fight to them so it's third down and nine for Paxton Lynch it has time and in the end zone an overthrow Emmanuel Sanders was back there was another high throw and it's fourth down remember for Paxton Lynch one of the things he said he's been thrown a lot more to the second and third receivers he hasn't had a lot of reps with Emmanuel Sanders and you see him off his back foot his feet not set got to start getting into a rhythm getting those feet set to connect on those type of passes Brandon McManus to try a 35yard field goal he's got a rookie long snapper and Casey Crider high school science teacher and then Riley Dixon the holder the punter is also a rookie but no problem for McManus to get the Broncos on the board Paxton Lynch moves the Broncos and striking distance an Atlanta keeps him out of the end zone back in Denver here that's half a mile over got to the game John you said the traffic can be tough sometimes weight away a ride in style absolutely did they have coach of that all rights a Paxton which gets the Broncos on the board just over eleven and a half to go before the half and from the fiveyard line Erik Weems off the McManus kick is tripped up so again short of the 25 you figure a win for the Broncos special teams as they make Weems return it and gain a net of four Julio Jones did have a catch remember was called off because of a penalty that's alright with the Atlanta Falcons and I think one of the great reasons for the success they've got a superstar in the biggest form in Julio Jones but Chris we sat down with them yesterday he's one of the most humble players in this league all he wants to do is win two weeks ago one catch against New Orleans but they won they put up 45 points he said that's the point right we're supposed to score in a way on first down Matt Ryan deep for Julio Jones who just couldn't get out of the fingertips well Julio Jones said I don't need to be in the game for us to be aggressive on offense he was on that play and they just missed Julio Jones any way you can get him teeth they do and he can flatout go Matt Ryan just out throws him a little bit of game Mancha's in the Denver Bronco fans exhale after the incomplete long foul ball Wade Phillips jokes and I would triple cover that guy every doubt if I could said I only have 11 though second and 10 Ryan what's the football protected in the pocket and complete Chris Harris keeping albrecht Robinson from the football you see pressure coming from everywhere Ryan thrown a timing round getting knocked down and Chris Harris narrowly nearly picks that off and we talked about it in that last series you can hear this stadium start to get into it the momentum has shifted and that land has got to be able to weather this storm Brian now 6 out of 13 just under a hundred yards third and 10 for Julio Jones of the overthrown open for a moment there Ryan said we don't have to forcefeed he was trying to get enough for the first down and he had separation Julio Jones was open the second nearmiss in the drive and that's something we haven't seen from these guys but the the pass rush of the Atlanta of the Denver Broncos it effects quarterbacks even the best like Matt Ryan quick three and out bocher standing at the six of Atlanta nor would backing up fair catch called for right at the 20yard line of Denver John mentioned the momentum shifts Brian feeling it from the Bronco defense Julio Jones still without a catch Broncos are smiling they have the football trailing only by so I alluded to it before the break here's the route this is something you have not seen from the Falcons Julio Jones gets separation on Chris Harris and for the second time in the drive and overthrow we haven't seen that I mean you're talking Matt Ryan throwing it 72 percent now he's 6 for 14 under 50% the pressures starting to affect him Paxton Lynch hesitates there comes a flag and there's also a flag up around the 30 towards the secondary it looks like Tyson Jackson got ahold of Paxton Lynch his facemask when he attempted to sack him defense number 23 Tyson Jackson got his money's worth but he darn near pulled the head off Paxton Lynch but again we're seeing Atlanta Falcons defense who hasn't generated much pressure getting to Paxton Lynch in this game Lynch who said he never had a quarterback coach that simply got into the NFL I found that interesting he's had help in shape ease and shaping my throws and getting more touch on the football now you come to Denver you got quarterback coaches everywhere Kubiak was at quarterback great nap you got John Elway in the building and you got a lot of them the penalty puts the ball at the 35 yard line with Devante in the backfield he's got the football from the ball John now 11 times they're averaging less than three yards of carry early in this game against this beatup Atlanta defense something Kubiak was really in fat ik about in our production meetings we got to get our run game going we had it going early in the season the first two games you see 282 yards the last two games 141 now in those games they played Geno Atkins of Cincinnati and Gerald McCoy that can wreak havoc on a run again but Kubiak said that's not an excuse he did tell us look for Devante Bucher Buckner he felt like he had fresh legs and maybe could inject some energy into the run game and butcher guns there gets up near the 44 yard line about a yard and a half short of the first out again it's worth pointing out that Donald Stevenson the right tackle and Virgil green tight end both with calf injuries they're close to returning but there was hope that they would this week they have a Thursday night game that that could help the running game one thing that Gary Kubiak will always do and I played for Mike Shanahan here sometimes with this scheme early in the game their four yard runs but later in the game they develop into the big runs and Gary will not deviate from that they only need a yard to get the first down across the 45 Anderson doesn't get there Dwight Freeney the first one to get their breeding dome right here coming off the edge they are trying to freeze Freeney with Emmanuel Sanders on that jet sweep and Freddie a 15year vets Eze I'm not going for that so they try to bluff him with little reverse action from Emmanuel Sanders Frannie sees right through it goes and makes the tackle 15year veteran known for sacking the quarterback has created quite a spark for this Atlanta defense on fourth and short the punt weaves fair catch inside the Atlanta 10yard line has turned into a bit of a defensive struggle with the Falcons and Matt Ryan of a sevenpoint lead there's Marquand manual the secondary coach was Robert Alford I think offered a little upset about that penalty doing a great job to settling him down on the sidelines that punt was 48 yards without a return Ryan from the 8 yard line tell them Coleman the running back Brian hands it off to him on first down he gets up to the 10 yard line this Denver defense even against a hot quarterback like Ryan who's over his last five by the way in the last two truck look what they've done John and since around here in the wild I cut shredder you like the music both on this but in the last six games an impressive lineup of quarterbacks but the defense is a bigtime quarterbacks and they're just taking them all down those numbers are not good and that's what pressure can do to a quarterback and Wade Phillips dialing up the pressures and it's starting to mount on that Ryan you can feel second and 7 : and Tevin Coleman with a solid run to get up across the 25 yard line and a first down for Atlanta digs a malleable hole there was a lot of talk if Tevin Coleman was even in a play today because he has the sicklecell trait that can sometime be a struggle in the mile high but whatever he has it's working for him Tevin Coleman out running Darian Stewart to the perimeter and getting big yards for rushes 30 yards Freeman carries here and or he would have gotten across the 30yard line by Brandon Marshall who leads the Broncos and tackles let's get more on Tevin Coleman with man yeah but the Falcons were completely comfortable with Coleman playing in this game and so is he Coleman told me he just as a precaution he got an IV before the game he must say hydrated and keep his doctors informed on if he's feeling unwell Freeman up across the 35 yard line it'll bring a third and short thanks Pam Dan Quinn kind of communicated to us that there was some confusion people thought he had sicklecell anemia anemia which can often be a struggle and you just don't want to play with it he adds the trait he talked with the doctors he was fine to play he was cleared and he's playing well first down Devonta Freeman short of the 45 let's get a game break thanks Curt another rookie quarterback you talk about poise that young man we early in the year and that's what he has Freeman near another first down he did get the first down moving the chains and chew it up the clock here you see Devonta Freeman and this spin move maybe he's been talking to his teammate Dwight Freeney we pioneered the spin move on the defensive side that might say Freeman said I can do it too Freeman carries again and run for more than 65 yards already in this game against the Denver defense Atlanta not going really at a fast pace but not huddling on this Drive and it's something than a year two they're doing more under Kyle Shanahan Kyle knows that Matt Ryan's very comfortable in the no huddle and so play to your players strengths that's exactly what he's doing crowd this time Freeman gets stopped on Millar keeping his eyes wide open sometimes you know a little nohuddle little change in tempo Kyle Shanahan great respect that he has for Wade Phillips he talked about no one makes better adjustments in a game than Wade Phillips and so fouled up back trying to keep him offbalance which was a big challenge he's doing a good job six defensive backs into the Broncos on 35 Ryan floats one there's a flag he was trying to get to Freeland it looked like he was no five yard penalty automatic first down we saw early in the game Matt Ryan looking he those running backs these running backs are like receivers they run really good routes and Cory Nelson on Devonta Freeman and he certainly does tug at his hip a good call by the officials at the 45 yard line and a first down the benefit of that penalty there it is right here at the bottom of the screen he reaches back and grabs him as the balls in the air Denver you heard him talking about uncatchable but he clearly grabbed and didn't restricted him Freeman slipped through and gets near another first out close to the inside the 36 yard line of Denver talked earlier if there's a soft spot in my mind it's right down at the heart of this defense you get in the heavy personnel three running backs and you go right at him Alex Mack doing a tremendous job in the middle of that hit for the Atlanta Falcons three tight ends the fullback fake to Ryan has to get rid of it incomplete yet they use the three tight ends to Ivalo the target against the Oakland Raiders in their pass rusher earlier in the year and it was effective they used it with great success and and oftentimes what they'll do Chris run run run and then take a shot up top with the one receiver that's in there Jacob Tamme the second leading receiver on the team behind Willie seven different receiveth the seekers target they only need a yard here on third down from the 36 whatever and Coleman will be stopped short on the 11th play of this Drive unless they spot it we talked so much about Von Miller as a pass rusher but watch what he does to the run game that's just pure strength pushing toy low low and then almost tackling Coleman through toy Lolo von Miller Rex game plans in run and pass each team has gone for it already on fourth down and Quinn waiting to call time out trying to get some clock to run looks like they have a challenge on the spot maybe that's what that's what I was waiting for waiting to see a replay of the spot he thought he had the first down Lana is challenged with the manga line again time out so spotted short of the first down challenged by the Falcons the ruling was not a first down and challenged check this out elbow down after here millions right I was down with the ball short of the line again a Lannister well you know Dan Quinn challenged it but that challenge didn't work because it looked on first look like it was a first down but that elbow great chop by our crew and they're going on fourth and inches successful the last time around the goal line when Freeman got into the end zone Holmen is the back here Matt Ryan keeps and lunges forward Chris they went out this offseason and got Alex Mack not a sexy signing at center but this guy has made a difference in my mind he's really made this entire offense and where did they go on fourth down both times right behind Alex back right there Matt Ryan just gets behind his Center and Matt gets enough search for him to get the first down and it is the NFL's lightest offensive line Mack just over 310 they average to 305 pounds a line when they come in with three tight ends and Coleman splits out as a receiver bottom of your screen on first out from the 35 of Denver open is Austin Hooper run out of bounds by a keep the lead Austin Hooper's a guy who kind of sneaks in there on these three tight in packages he's average per catch this year's been 28 yards on five catches wide open again that's what he's been all year deceptively fast and the Falcons moving quick third round rookie from Stanford and Lana without a huddle after a pickup of 14 the three tight ends punched in the middle where you could see to the right of Matt Ryan and Ryan got rid of it knock down after throwing the pass incomplete Matt Ryan wanted Julio Jones right here but Christian Chris Harris just a great job playing that inside leverage and getting inside and then Matt Ryan really threw that ball away that's where he wanted to go but Matt Ryan talked about it a lot I'm not gonna forcefeed it to julio that's gotten me in trouble in the past and he won't go there he did it he'll have the twominute warning but Atlanta's out of timeouts on second and 10 from the toilet lately drive must be the 15th play Devonta Freeman cannot get outside Shane ray got zooming spun down as we near the twominute warning two minutes to go before the hand manner ayat had 500 yards last week he's got 120 through the air but the Falcons lead by seven the three tight ends Atlanta going with well coach done six defensive backs on 39 I'm complete around the 15 Bowman knockdown it'll be short of the first down Bradley Roby running with him on the Broncos use a timeout Chris you take a look at Von Miller and just a sack artist and right here again doesn't get to Matt Ryan but look at the disruption in his face that wears on an offensive line he's got four and a half sacks in the fourth quarter he wears on people he wears him out he finds their weakness and then he finishes it late in games bond Miller beautiful thing to watch this guy play the game lining up for a field goal will check out Matt Ryan's attempt in just a moment here Julio Jones says but targeted today but no catches so far after 12 for 300 yards receiving last week field goal try Bryant good earlier from 46 this is 33 trying to go 10 for 10 this season and Atlanta expands its lead 13 to 3 a mile up around the field we have Jean Lynch Chris Myers up in the booth and the guy is getting ready for the visa halftime let's check in with Curt Menefee matt ryan again producing points seven minute drive you know John I think we thought the Broncos expected them to play great defense but looking at the numbers the Atlanta defense has risen to the occasion even if it is a rookie quarterback in his first start well it's the defense that's been struggling all year last week versus Carolina they were clearly better and it started up front but Chris I can't say enough about the defensive effort for the Falcons remember for their top five linebackers out so they're stopgap they got safeties playing linebackers but they've been really really good they keep in the Broncos offense in check Shawne Weatherspoon out for the year they hope to vondre campbell and dion jones will be healthy enough next Sunday when the Falcons play in Seattle Broncos with two timeouts and 148 to fly and lattimer's bringing it out of the end zone and excellent special teams as Eric Weems who's a returner on the other side makes the tackle tomorrow it's an LDS game 3 the cops taking on the giant Chicago with a 200 lead and a pitching matchup outstanding ariana against Bumgarner MLB postseason continues tomorrow on fs1 Dan Quinn actually got to meet coach Madden the manager I should say Joe Madden of the Chicago Cubs were he Morris a friend of his linked the two and talked about philosophy and working with young players and building team chemistry he's worked for Joe Maddon and Quinn right now trying to win his fourth straight game is Emmanuel Sanders out of bounds so incomplete what a break on the ball by true fun looks like this is going to be a catch but Trufant continues to play Sanders does not have control as he's going out of bounds good call by the officials second down ten flinch backed up in his own sixteenth pressure coming paws out and he got it back Vic Beasley already has a sack today and knocked that one loose I tell you they are really missing Donald Stevenson at the right tackle some Rilo a good player but he's injured he is not healthy he's coming off a shoulder surgery the right elbow he has no strength in his upper body so Vic Beasley a guy who's been struggling to get to the quarterback now has two sacks today working against sembra low and I just think some brillo is not healthy enough to be playing quite yet but he's forced into playing with Donald Stevenson hurt thin on the offensive line sat out for eight or nine months just doing nothing and gonna walk back into football shape so it's CJ Anderson just to give the rookie putter some room Morocco's will want to let that clock run because Atlanta does not have any timeouts and they're gonna have to pump the ball back to the Falcon office who came in averaging 38 points a game hindsight always 20/20 and I see exactly what Dan Quinn was thinking on that fourth down or third down when he thought he had the line to gain he challenged it and that ate up that last timeout when it was an unsuccessful challenge Reilly Dixon seventh round pick from Syracuse standing at the 2 yard line of Denver and Weems back inside the 30 of Atlanta and a timeout Broncos take it you take a look at Julio Jones the NFL's leading receiver 300 yards last week in one game against the Carolina Panthers but I gotta tell you there's the offensive pass interference when he had his only catch that was negated by the penalty but I keep to leave Chris Harris have really done a nice job and they've been aided by the pressure that has made Matt Lyon miss him on a couple of throws that they had and there you see after receivers have 300 yards there's not many of them but they typically don't come back for whatever reason a prolific game's defenses don't want to be embarrassed or shamed add 488 receiving yards in the first four games none for Julio Jones today their hamstrings might be tired from penance so much after a 300 yard reception game Reilly Dixon blooms it out of there fair catch Weems waives everybody away and it gets inside the 20 yard line and that will bring an end to the half Broncos will get the ball at least Atlanta will be kicking off to the Broncos to start the second half of the Falcons on the road at the lead here in Denver let's go to Curt Menefee in Los Angeles for the visa halftime report then I think some quick throws everything's been downfield I never thought I'd say this but they're struggling to protect against the Atlanta Falcons who've struggled so mightily getting to the quarterback and so I think some good throws to get the young man feeling confident would help him out and the offense out and you see the rush yards the Broncos wanted to run the ball better was a goal they haven't accomplished that as facher kicks off to start the second half Cody Latimer out of his own end zone and brought down short of the 20 yard line was sent down to the field and Pam Oliver we had a production issue on the microphone will clear that up and get back to Pam in just a moment dan Quinn who last year remember his team and his first year at Avaya they started out five and OH wound up eight and eight he talked about what this team learned from that experience as they try to go to four and one this season Lynch open from the 42 it's Emmanuel Sanders running around and brought down at the 45 well you see Gary Kubiak trying to get him in rhythm the playaction pass and watch the linebackers get sucked up and then he's going to throw right behind those linebackers up and over wheeler right to Sanders and a good start for Paxton Lynch in the Broncos in the second half all the way up to the 45 a gain of 26 and a dangerous throw that was almost intercepted Dez went roof on there is a flag down Trufant got to the football passing offense offense number 10 10yard penalty first down that call on Emanuel Sanders let's go back down to Pam well you guys were talking about the run game so was Gary Kubiak I asked him how do you get that going he says maybe we need to up the tempo but we really need that run game as for Paxton Lynch combination of things he says path protection he's got to get the ball out faster Atlanta's Dan Quinn we talked to him about just the offensive game plan how aggressive it is they're taking it to an aggressive defense he said that's our identity all right Thank You Pam another completion but a minimal gain here after the penalty backed up Denver on first and 20 boy there's a lot on that sheet there's a lot on that sheet and Gary Kubiak right now is looking for something that will work on that big sheet Dan Quinn and his group Richard Smith defensive coordinator doing a tremendous job bottling up this Denver Bronco offense second and 16 Paxton Lynch rifles a throw incomplete John Phillips the target and that's gonna be third and long dan Quinn talked a lot about this offseason and what they went and went they went through as a team and they really it was about a connection as a team they brought in some special forces they feel like they're a much closer team like they're a player led team and he talked about this week it's all about focus and he said John we were focused all week we were dialed into our game plan and I got to tell you it's showing on the field they've sacked the quarterback twice Quinn said as long as we effects the quarterback we're doing our job on defense underneath thrown down run away as Benny Fowler and that brings up fourth down I tell you they don't they're careful not to compare Keon O'Neill to camp Chancellor because they want him to be able to develop his own identity he did visit with kam chancellor and I tell you the young man plays a lot like them because one thing I see when he hits him they go backwards just like they do when camp chance on me it's a you don't have a chance John to say hi to each other again in person when Atlanta plays in Seattle next Sunday his punt taking Weems as he lets it go into the end zone he was back inside the 10 and so the offense will start from the 20yard line Atlanta has the lead of the football terrific weather weekend here in Denver and Raheem Morris with Julio Jones on the Atlanta side line and really interesting connection Raheem Morris was a DB coach head coach the Tampa Bay Buccaneers he coached a keep to leave early in his career so a big connection in this game quick pass is caught that's Julio Jones first catch of the game as he goes down around the 30 and look at that's not forcefed but that's a clear attempt let's get Julio involved in this game because Atlanta knows they aren't going to hold on and win this game 13 3 they're gonna have to score more points and I love it come back safe but aggressive and also getting your star player involved in the game just short you can see of the first down Talib is lined up against Julio Jones bring them the carry and gets the first down up near the 35 yard line so to leave doesn't move around he likes staying on that left corner spot well this team is loaded at cornerback so you got to leave on one side yet Chris Harris in the slot in there nickel they bring Bradley Roby and so Wade Phillips said we don't need to travel we just really feel like we can all stay on the same side and they feel like that's better for Freeman and shame they ran him out of bounds remember DeMarcus Ware we haven't even talked about the fact that he's out but look at Shane ray up top it's just a great job we talked about setting the edge he makes Devonta Freeman bubble and then goes ahead and finishes the play outstanding effort by the secondyear man from Missouri and a former first round selection seven Pullman comes in at a busy first half he's the game's leading rusher in trouble here and it's up to the 37 it will be third down you know Matt Ryan sometimes we think of this tall kind of lumbering athlete he's improved his athleticism the longer he's been in this league and right there it's invaluable because instead of being a sack he actually turns it into one two yard game a really good job of Matt Ryan eluding the pressure of the Denver Broncos there's a helmet problem with Chris Harris the starting corner otherwise he'd be out there on third mate need to get to the 45 for a first half he's going down Bob Miller sacking that Ryan we talked about it Vaughn kind of probes at these tackles he wears them out he hits him with power early and then here comes the moves face the power he puts his best white Dwight Freeney impression and spinning on the way to the quarterback in Matt Ryan and this guy Chris some player the best defensive player in football in my opinion the Super Bowl MVP and he can dish Matt bocher from the 20 of Atlanta flag flies ball rolls all the way down to the oneyard line where it is tagged down but let's check on the flag during the kick holding receiving team number 37 half the distance to the goal first down while half the distance to the oneyard line is trouble but the Denver defense rising to the occasion some of the stories from week 5 around the NFL the Vikings behind Sam Bradford and that stifling defense go to five oh no the only other unbeaten team because Carson Wentz the rookie quarterback in the Eagles fell to the Detroit Lions and Tom Brady back for the Patriots and continuing to roll that ball of fame career Paxton Lynch beginning a career in Denver his first start and after a 68 yard punt and then a penalty at their own oneyard line trailing by 10 Paxton Lynch at his own end zone and that's intercepted he hung it up in the air Ricardo Allen came over picked it off Gary Kubiak trying to instill some confidence and trying to inject some energy into this offense takes a shot but Paxton Lynch doesn't do a good job with his eyes of controlling this guy in Ricardo Allen all he's going to do is range over here for the interception see Ricardo Allen that's just tremendous range by Ricardo Allen going and getting that pick a little bit of pressure Ricardo Allen reading the rookie quarterback like a book and going to get in that ball Grady Jared putting the heat on and 1st of this year fifth interception from the Atlanta defense and Wade Phillips said this is the kind of game where a turnover whoever has the ball last can win it and this could be a major moment for Atlanta trying to add to a 10point lead Matt Ryan Julio Jones with to lead covering and Julio Jones gets down around the 22 yard line Julio Jones Chris he's 6 foot 3 220 pounds and I'm just astounded again you see the protection astounded by his acceleration because look right here it looks like a catch but then Talib is going to be right there but instead he separates from to leave and turns it into huge arch watch the acceleration right there that guy's an incredible player and you just had pointed out Raheem Morris talking with him on that other sideline so they talked about to leave when they matched up a gain of 20 on that play Coleman out in at the running back spot Brian to throw and completes to Aldred Robinson here comes a flag passive hats offense over 80 Levine toy fellow the tight end called for the offensive pass interference watch toy Lolo going to come into the screen right there and they call him for clearing out the linebacker making the room for Aldrich Robinson spotted back at the 32yard line again penalties affecting the Falcons on drives and they've been close to adding to their lead first and 20 von Miller not in the game at the moment they run the ball down with a 31 it's 7 : and smallscreen stadiumsized content wants live local sunday games on your smartphone with NFL mobile von Miller came in leading the NFL in sacks has won today sixandahalf of course this team leading the league in that department well we see them on the sidelines and people think probably what's wrong but Wade Phillips does a great job of keeping von fresh throughout the game they rotate at that outside linebacker position you see the play selection very balanced for the Atlanta Falcons almost 50/50 complete Matt Ryan southern Coleman in for a falcon touchdown of Chris from the first drive that's been the matchup they've been looking for their running backs in the passing game against the Denver Bronco linebackers and there's Brandon Marshall responsible for Tevin Coleman and it's just a straight seam route he just out runs them and Matt Ryan throws it dime to Tevin Coleman for the touchdown nothing real tricky about that just straight up the field Brandon Marshall sits Coleman right behind him and Matt Ryan delivers Bryant on for the extra point and the Falcons with a 20 to 3 lead Matt Ryan came in tied for the league lead with 11 touchdown passes he delivers his 12 Coleman of the receiving air John which chrismyers and Matt Ryan with the touchdown pass and Atlanta with a surprising 22 3 lead Bosh are kicking off number the outstanding punt and then the turnover and then the touchdown producing points out to the 25 comes the Denver offense screening saves lives and the NFL the American Cancer Society encourage everyone to join in the fight against breast cancer learn more about a crucial catch day October 25th find out how you can help make a crucial catch and nfl.com slash thing great job by the NFL supporting that effort and Chris he we were talking during the break I mean you kind of start to think this is the Falcons day when ba sure to set that up he shanks a pun and it goes 6 yards and pins him on the oneyard line and then the interception and on the strike for Matt Ryan's and Paxton which having the make up ground and at the house up he gets knocked down and that's ruled a fumble the Broncos have it looks like Devante booker got it at the 15yard line well Vic Beasley people in Atlanta had thought he was a firstround bust and he is busting out against Tyson Bravo and the Denver Broncos some Bravo cannot block him there's the matchup again he keeps swatting those hands down and Paxton Lynch is going to have to figure out that the ball is everything in this league two hands on the ball you got to get rid of it faster and just in case you're wondering Trevor Simeon inactive today Austin Davis the backup and which is going to have to run it's up to the 20 yard line I'm Gary Kubiak I mean you can't do it here on third down but you've got an athletic quarterback quick throws and I would move the pocket a little because the stationary pocket is not working they can't lock the Atlanta Falcons and I never thought I would say that because the Falcons have been searching for a pass rush for a long long time last couple of years started to come alive against the Carolina Panthers last week and they brought it today Simeon it was a decision all the way up until Saturday Gary Kubiak hoping that Trumper Simeon his starter he's still the starter he's injured for this game and they have a short week playing Thursday night Paxton Lynch tipped in the air but Carr staying with the football Demaryius Thomas well Paxton Lynch starting to do a better job of stepping up in the pocket Keon O'Neill reading his eyes but Demaryius Thomas rate Java concentration brings up fourth down they are just short of the first down its fourth love interest Kubiak sends in his offense this point down 22 3 he's believing in his offense to be able to get this first down Lynch keeps and gets the first down you're six seven just fall forward and stretch the ball out an aggressive gutsy called by Gary Kubiak paradis and Scofield do a nice job along with some Bravo of creating some surge on that right side he's the 23rd player named Lynch to play in the NFL course John Lynch you're hearing Dick Lynch member of the Giants at 37 interceptions Marshawn Lynch CJ Anderson carries here in the running game has not helped out Paxton Lynch months today running game hasn't been good and that's of concern I think for the Denver Broncos because you're playing against a group I keep going back to it but they are playing with the guy at linebacker calling the signals who's a safety issue I'll they're playing with the backup there's usually an outside backer in the middle and you can't run the football there's a problem there Laroy Reynolds who made his fifth NFL start a Jayhawk they signed this week time and deliver the walk came out and complete the ruling at the 45 Thomas couldn't hold it there's a flag down and a good hit my wheeler you get Tysabri low for a hold holding number 74 10yard penalty Chris remember coming into this game Atlanta had the least sacks in the NFL and it's primarily happened and I hate to pick on Tyson Bravo but you got to call a spade a spade it's been Vic Beasley now it's Adrian Claiborne you got to give some Bravo's some help or get him out of there again I think it's a health issue I don't think he's healthy enough to be playing at least not strong enough and he's struggling mightily Dan Quinn at his staff identifying the area to attack on this team the numbers against this Atlanta defense as good as the offensive numbers were for the Falcons it was the opposite for the defense but they've held up well today it's not like they're blitzing either these are fourman pressures Paxton Lynch has time they set it up to Booker and he puts a nice move on and gets thrown down at the 35 yard line it's got a quick game break and check in with Curt Menefee well here's a nice move by Zico Elliott leads leading rusher the rookie out of Ohio State takes this in 60 yards Cowboys cruising against the Bengals 28 to nothing in the third and by the way John Howie was just talking about the right tackle struggles here in Denver just as you mentioned but Howie great minds think alike how about them Cowboys Jimmy saw the rookie running back in the update from Kurt Devante Booker the rookie from Heat's off fourth rounder in the backfield as Lynch on third and 12 is scrambling around he'll go down around the 35 yard line this wasn't nowhere for him to run you got to tell you you look at Vic Beasley right here now in the middle he spies and he's just watching Paxton Lynch waiting for him to run keeps him in front of them that's why Paxton Lynch running all over Dan Quinn and Richard Smith the defensive coordinator changing up fourman pressure now let's rush three with the spy Vic Beasley really coming of age for the Atlanta Falcons today Reilly Dixon the rookie on the punt once again he's been busy Eric Weems fair catch at the 20yard line Falcons on offense with a 23 advantage the Atlanta defense has made it difficult on Paxton Lynch during his first NFL start Vic Beasley checking out the Microsoft Surface and likes what he sees he should because he's wearing this offensive line and in particular Tyson Bravo out see how the Denver defense responds as Devonta Freeman gets up to the 25yard line Chris you just said it look I I played on a great defense in Tampa and when there's moments like this if you are great and you want to be known as the best you don't just make them punt you take the ball away you score and this this team right now sorely needs a play from this defense they have yet to come up with a tick away today at the Denver defense on second and five Freeman the bringing up third down in five top Davis coming in to make the tackle we haven't called Derek Wolf's name today he came in with four sacks right behind von Miller in that area I think with Kyle Shanahan we talked to him I talked to him last night and he talked about keeping this defense offbalance and they're putting enough one out there that it's putting a chill on this bonad pass rush to the Denver Broncos a chance for that Bronco defense on third down time for Matt Ryan Sanu held on and made the catch Mohamed Sanu all the way up across the 45 yard loss so you got it great pass rusher like Von Miller how do you block them well you ask your little receiver to help out that's exactly what he does that gives Matt Ryan enough time and Matt Ryan now the accuracy starting to come into play and Matt Ryan getting hotter as this game goes on he's over 200 yards passing today a gain of 22 on that flip from the 47 freedom and good defense there TJ Ward as Wade Phillip said he's kind of a leader of the defense he plays like wildfire and teammates follow him second of mine homeowners are now Boman carries there comes a flag as he gets to the 45 of Denver holding offense number 51 second down it's Alex Mack the Pro Bowl Center the acquisition from Cleveland is gonna be working against I believe that's kill go right there as he starts to escape gets extended the official sees it when Chris despite the penalty they're winning the line of scrimmage Denver usually dominates line of scrimmage Atlanta is beating them pushing them off the line of scrimmage third quarter winding down on second down 19 back inside their own 37 38 yard line at Alliance throw knockdown incomplete Jones had it what a hit Darian steward not dead wall out watch this defense there's so many stars von Miller to Marcus where he talked about TJ Ward but don't sleep on Darian Stewart this is a physical football player legal hit goes to Julio Jones hip knocks the football out great play by Stewart Ryan came low big the last time on third and long another six defensive backs in as the third quarter wines down middle of the fear catch made Mohamed Sanu brought down thought came out but that came out as he hit the chronic TJ Ward has it was that play we were talking about Chris you need something happened you want to call yourself the best you better be the best and you better take it away it's exactly what TJ wore it does you all turnovers aren't reviewed and confirmed on this one was what to take away what a play I mean you talk about taking it away that's exactly what he did he hit him jarred it loose and then grabbed it away phenomenal play by TJ Ward he wanted the big defensive play there celebrate they made a switch and juggled the offensive line a little bit on first and ten Lynch completes net hard is Demaryius Thomas they've moved Michael Scofield who was playing right guard out to right tackle and they brought in Darian Weems now at the right guard position so some Bravo clearly wasn't effective and now they've made that move to try to get some pass protection interesting five wide receivers come in for Paxton Lynch he gets it to one of them did he hang on let's see if any Fowler held it and it is a catch and remember along with the five wides the tempo we take a look at Benny Fowler it's like a catch to me remember buddy Fowler caught the last peyton manning passion the NFL it was a twopoint conversion of the Super Bowl he hung on that one but Gary Kubiak talked about maybe up in the tempo to help the young quarterback going with a little quicker tempo now and time for winch slips the tackle dives to get inside the 44 yard line let's get another game break with some Briley looking on CJ enters from the back he gets the football that's his best run of the day it's a first down for the Bronco inside the 23 of the letter take a look a little space for CJ Anderson Weems actually makes the key block they brought just brought him in that gives CJ Anderson some space but you know who you credit for that TJ Ward an injected life into this team into this stadium TJ wore getting the ball back we'll see if the Broncos can capitalize after a gain of 10 looks like somebody move second call on Schofield today again at that right tackle spot started at right guard back up the Broncos to the 28 yard line of Atlanta Broncos have the best fourthquarter point differential in the NFL plus 39 and they're going to need it the throw rally here he's Lee his head Maxton life well Vic Beasley just wearing whoever they put in right tackle a little stutter and he's just beating him with speed rushes Vic Beasley gets there at least can he get half a sack if they give him a full that's his fourth sack of the day Atlanta putting that pressure on it's the guy who had five sacks in his career prior to today's game and Vic Beasley and many people like I said earlier were concerned that he was going to be a bus Brian Cox the dline coach doing a great job developing the young man mass is caught by CJ Anderson after that sack a loss of seven four sacks for Vic Beasley wonder if he got tired of hearing about von Miller and wolf and all those guys over on the Bronco side I think they do I mean you you hear so much about the other defense and you see Paxton Lynch been under duress all day long and this is not where you want your rookie quarterback to live in these third and 15 Beasley inside on this play Lynch dumps the passive extract anderson couldn't hold it now that changes if you were going to go on fourth down or not exactly I think if they get close they're Kubiak now has a decision to go for it now it's no decision and you got to try to kick the field goal Brandon McManus will try and get the team within two touchdowns and two extra points 46 yard field goal attempt he's one for one today and McManus delivers after the turnover they cut into the Falcon leaves in the Hall of Fame Dan Quinn fired up along with Brian Cox on that defense and what a job I mean I think it's got to be noted this was a group that was one of the worst in football coming into this game Richard Smith you could see it start to turn around verse Carolina and they brought it today McManus is kick after the field goal out to the 25yard line Falcons working their way from Denver up to Seattle next Sunday protecting a 226 lead nearby level of the ski area total ski season I think that's called a Manning Terrier Chris feels good trying to get you ready for the Westminster Dog Show on Fox that's right coming up after the Super Bowl on Fox from the 25yard line man Roy arrogant out and seven Coleman down the sideline Coleman already a touchdown catch today and a big gainer there well when something's working keep going back to it and all day long it's been the running backs of the Atlanta Falcons on the linebackers of the Denver Broncos in the past game and Tevin Coleman is wearing those guys out Todd Davis nor Brandon Marshall can hang with him Tevin Coleman having a huge day 49 yards on that play and you're worried about Julio Jones and Jacob Tamme who's the second leading receiver hey gotta worry about running backs catching the football out of the backfield they have all afternoon Freeman carries here and Freeman with another first down I'll Shanahan he kind of painted the scenario when I talked to him he said listen going up and against one of the best in Wade Phillips he makes great adjustments I got to try to keep him and them offbalance Kyle Shanahan has succeeded in a big way along with Matt Ryan his quarterback who's having a lightsout season thus far and I mixes it up with the three tight end zone Freeman the running back from the 15 Freeman waited for a block and picked up three or four yards Matt Ryan by the way is forty fourth straight game of 200 yards passing or more fact the last defense to stop him was Stan Quinn in Seattle when he was the defensive coordinator you see those Drew Brees has the weekend off for the Saints and the best part about that is Matt Ryan will tell you along with Julio Jones as the Falcons are winning during at a stretch I love the start of that series by Kyle Shannon would have been really easy just to hand the ball off try to milk clock and Steady's going after him Freeman another chunk of yardage they are the Falcons as a team or over a hundred yards rushing today and I've been talking about it and sometimes it was on plays where there were penalties that went backwards but they are clearly winning the line of scrimmage their offensive line is driving that of the Denver Broncos off the ball and that's easy pickings for Devonta Freeman running the football and Dan Quinn said of his quarterback Matt is on a mission through the offseason through the start of this season they lost the opener trying to win their fourth straight facing a third and two going to the ground the catch made by Mohamed Sanu but not in the endzone what a catch it was me look at that one hand and the concentration going to be interested while hits the ground I don't think he had control when it hit the ground and there was some movement so on the field called a catch watch right here the tip of the ball there's a challenge flag John coming from Kubiak the fan saw it here and they let out a roar see it right here Denver's hours with the passes and replay not ruling on the field a catch challenged by the Broncos sanu rule the catch on the field challenged eight minutes 24 seconds report including the seven yard line ethical fear is not charged with the timeout a big turn reversal because otherwise it's the first down well somewhat surprising because the trend has been unless completely obvious they've been sticking with it but I did think prior then if you don't have control on the ground hits the ball and it moves it all that's not a catch and so make a good call by McCauley when it's all said and done different from the trend though usually they stay we've gots called on the field the field goal try from 25 yards a little bit of an adventure keeper but it's good and a 236 advantage for Matt Ryan of the Falcons here in Denver they gave a half a sack to Dwight Freeney so Vic Beasley three and a half sacks officially today look they came in with four sacks as a team as a defense all year long and so Vic Beasley in this group have been making Paxton Lynch his debut as a starter miserable four sacks for Atlanta the Broncos just have two sacks of Matt Ryan and Lattimer brings the ball out of the end zone oh stop short of a 23 yard line people affected by severe weather and other disasters need help now if you want to help those impacted by Hurricane Matthew text Matthew ma th e w 9 0 9 9 9 to give $10 to the American Red Cross hurricane relief Tevin Coleman 132 yards receiving last 100 yard receiving game by an Atlanta running bagans Ward done in 2003 Atlanta settles for a field goal but as a 236 lead airing it out incomplete Thomas the targets Robert Alford running with him Demaryius Thomas such a great player but you want to win this game you got to make plays like this it's good throw from the rookie and he struggles to locate it that ball is certainly catchable right through the hands of Demaryius Thomas Paxton Lynch 11 out of 20 122 yards he did suffer the interception at a touchdown pass last week in relief in Tampa that went to Emanuel Sanders Jordan Norwood hauling that in just over 8 minutes to play Seattle Seahawks not a lot of guessing to what they're doing they're simply getting back in there pent that patented three cover three zone which means three deep two corners deep safety deep four underneath zone droppers and just eyes on the quarterback and react to the throw we mentioned the you meant the Falcons the Seahawks defensive comms yet something from Dan Quinn it looks like that yeah and Atlanta will play them next Sunday as Lynch is going to run and slide and we heard a pop in the end of it but no flag tell ya that was Falcon on Falcon right there and that was kion who Neil trying to put a lick on Paxton Lynch and he ends up hitting his own it sounded maybe worse than it was Vic Beasley I promise she's gonna be going Kiana open your eyes I'm on your team seven minutes to go and on forth and along the Broncos have no choice but to go for it and off hooker and I don't think he got it Philip wheeler making a big play for Atlanta they're gonna give him the first down and I look close the Falcons making everything great job by Booker reaching that ball out at the end but the Falcons making everything tough for the Denver Broncos in this offense just dick get the first down hooker stays in max and Lynch has to get rid of it and it's almost intercepted this this offensive line for the Denver Broncos has been awful today Paxton Lynch has it been much better but the protection again this is a team that came in with four sacks the Atlanta Falcons but yet the Falcons have been all over Paxton Lynch just watch it here it's Adrian Claiborne just making max Garcia the left guard whip so the offensive line for the Denver Broncos playing a poor poor game Cabala smile all mylist had an interception there Booker the carry and he's met bard that keeps blowing up there a first down he fumbled on his very first NFL carry the fourth round rookie and Gary Kubiak said we're gonna work with him a lot and make sure he's comfortable but we like his moves we wanted to be out there I think a lot of people are wondering why would you run the ball at this point it's because they can't block the Atlanta Falcons when they go back to pass he picked up eight such third and two open Tomas steps out of mouths gets the first down now look at Paxton Lynch has it looked great today but here's why people are so excited you just watch the way he throws a ball like this and it's special this is called driving the ball and that ball is on a rope and it's accurately thrown I mean that's a bigtime throw and that's why everybody from John Elway to Gary Kubiak everybody in town here is really excited about Paxton Lynch moving forward Sanders and Thomas each with four catches today underneath in the middle of the field inside the 40 is Devante booker and you know for a 67 quarterback he doesn't have that lengthy delivery where he opens up the arms a lot it's more tight with the Paxton way and it's funny you mentioned he'd never had a quarterback coach and so he said he used to listen to broadcasters say it's bad when it was long so I just started throwing it quick compact from the middle floating it incomplete couple receivers in the area including Benny Fowler let's get a game break check it he's almost a mistake if the Chargers have a lead in the late moments Anderson carries some tough bitch but running hard to get inside the 35 over the land it's a first down but you know what I get the feeling that Dan Quinn Richard Smith they're perfectly fine with this because you know what's happened the clock is ticking this is a three score game they're keeping the ball in front and even right here that's a good game nice run by CJ Anderson but the clock is just continuing to run all the way down to 425 it will field open again slipping the tackle Jordan Marwar getting down to the 17 of Atlanta you'd like to see the Broncos move in with a little more urgency the offensive lineman walking up to the to the football and time is definitely a factor under four minutes to play all three timeouts but trailing 23 six drives that low catch laid yes he stayed inbounds good work by Emanuel Sanders over there great concentration by Sanders bringing that football in tough is catching foot bar those low balls because your eyes typically don't go down all the way to the ball but Sanders a veteran player and that's just a really special catch middle of the field fighting for more CJ Anderson and that's a first down Vince at the 12 close for the 11 yard line of Atlanta important thing is that you get it in but you got a hurry again they're just moving kind of at a snail's pace and they don't have that time it's like we have an injured player on the Falcons it's Brian Poole just over three and a half minutes of the fourth quarter backs to the Lynch approaching 180 yards through the air first and goal Broncos inch is gonna go down another sack for the Falcons Farini and Claybourne combining a loose woman the guy I got on the offensive line but this is not the offensive line this is holding the football Paxton Lynch will learn in this league one you go to two you go to three they aren't there throw it out of bounds and live to see another down taking that sack right now with this time is just really penal to him and Brian Cox and his guys playing great today second and goal dumps it off CJ Anderson thrown down an aggressive tackle inside the five Atlanta like I said they're fine with that clocks moving now Broncos burn another timeout I don't know if you've seen lethal weapon yet John good you have to definitely check it out picked anybody everybody walked to Damon Wayans play Crawford perfect together it's nonstop fun for an entire hour he kept the only episode of lethal weapon wednesday on fox plus a bit of a shock here the way the atlanta defense is claiming the the Denver defense has done their best keeping the Falcons from running up the big numbers but the Atlanta defense has been off the charts good today they've been great and as I was watching the film last week it looked like a different defense when they faced the Carolina Panthers they effected the quarterback didn't necessarily sack him a lot but they were around him and they've brought it today and they finished the deal and maybe one of the reasons some numbers here they're they're giving up the room as you said for Denver to to up the clock even though they're moving the ball and on third and goal Broncos trying to get in the end zone and there is the past bleaching Demaryius Thomas for the touchdown standing after you're going to see him reach across right there gets across the plane that's a bigtime effort by Demaryius Thomas not so easy to do when you got 300 pounders all over you he doesn't make that reach that bowl doesn't get into the endzone Atlanta then that tough Thomas's third touchdown catch of the season and the first one he's received from Paxton Lynch who has now tuned in his week career five catches today it's a 10point game with just over two and a half to play so now you've got to think that Atlanta yes they do they have their hands team down on the field meaning that they're expecting an onside kick onside kicks have gotten a lot tougher to execute in today's football because they don't let you truly overload a side and because that's a player safety deal and they used to be tough now they're a lot tougher well some kicker as you talk to them John some up like to try to bounce it right some way kicking it off a guy in and standing up close who maybe they don't think has the best hands even though you just said the hands team is up there so some kickers have kick it with rolls along and they try to grab it once it goes to the middle yeah I would say he has some good hands he's that he's a good guy to have out there and a big frame Arthur Wang excited that the Falcons if they hang on would win their fourth straight go to four and one where's the Panthers play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Monday night without Cam Newton in the NFC South we mentioned the Saints are wrong mr. blank ah so excited about the new stadium that's nearing completion down there in Atlanta future Superbowl sites goes there's a flag down right away and this touched by a falcon and the Broncos have it you got to think offsides though where that flag was thrown on the Broncos they got past the line before McManus hit it Cory Nelson came up with it but the flag came out right away they call it on Dakota Watson right there Wow that's close it really is close great kick great kick by McManus and those are so tough to execute that was very close surprised they called that Jodie Kinnison Dakota Watson had been playing affect coming off his best game as a Bronco on special teams he's one of their stalwarts on special teams very good special team player but a tough penalty because the Broncos did get possession of the football so to wind it up five yards back a trying again how do you go to the other side of the field Oh same area grabbed right away Austin Hooper got his hands on it and fell on the football the developing story was that's the flinch the first rounder in his first NFL start and Atlanta made a tough on and his offensive line did not play well he didn't make it any easier on himself though one thing Paxton Lynch will learn you have to throw the ball quickly on time in rhythm or you will be beat up in this league and the Atlanta Falcons only four sacks coming in today we're happy to be the guys that beat him up you see five sacks seven hurries for knockdowns tough day in his debut but that young man I could say with confidence is gonna have a very bright future in this league Freeman Carey let's check in with Curt Menefee for it's been the first three and a half quarters for San Diego at 14 they just continue to lose people to injury then last week it was Barret the great corner torn ACL he's out for the year and John Thursday night in San Diego the Chargers will host the Broncos and the wonder if Paxton Lynch will start with Trevor Simeon be healthy enough to go with that left shoulder injury free them knocked down he'll lose yard at one of the few plays that didn't work well on the ground for Atlanta but you know you talked at the beginning about of course Matt Ryan and Julio Jones but you mentioned the two running backs Freeman and Coleman and they have done a good job not only on the ground but catching the football today well III think you know a lot of people were asking me Atlanta started fast last year why is it different this year when I look at the offensive side of the ball they're very versatile they have Julio Jones they got a lot of other weapons you just mentioned the two running backs they were big part of it today but a lot of receivers that can be a part of it that tight ends and this defense I don't think will be a great defense all year but that they can play like this be good enough then watch out for these Falcons and Matt Ryan much more comfortable with Kyle Shanahan who's upstairs this time as opposed to down on the sidelines like it was last year year two I think he figures out all right how are we gonna be best together Kyle West see it better up top and he moved up there running the ball in the clutch had some tough yards for Freeman inside the 30 the clock continues to run they'll take it down to the twominute warning with the Broncos out of timeouts and build a couple during this series to try and keep Atlanta from using it up on fourth down and one two minutes to go in Denver it's been that kind of day for the Broncos the Falcons for the commanding lead on fourth down and one this Kyle Shanahan figuring a and the numbers to the police election okay you talk about balance I mean that's what you can't go back against the Denver Broncos and throw it fifty times because Von Miller Shane ray those guys Derek Wolfe they will make your life miserable instead he runs it more than he passes it and the results have been phenomenal don't want to try a field goal and risk a block or a run back here so if you get the first down with no timeouts you can run the clock out but they whoa the ball was deflected trying to get it to Freeman and Denver gets the football Matt Ryan trying call kind of a roll pass getting the halfback and von Miller said great handeye coordination puts a tip on that ball a lot of people say why would you pass it well if you get stopped on a run play that finds stops in position right so it wouldn't matter the idea was get the first down and don't risk anything on a block field goal so another opportunity for Paxton Lynch completes to an ambulance Sanders the ball come out and like it was juggled catch made me held onto it Neal tried to knock it out I'll tell you what if I'm Dan Quinn I'm giving a game ball to everybody on this defense because undermanned everybody's talking about the Denver defense and they have come out they've been swarming they've won that line of scrimmage up front they've been awesome but over the field again that's where Lynch has been comfortable throwing the football wonder takes that up across the 46 yard line again no timeouts Denver I know in practice when we were out there Gary Kubiak made Lynch work on a 25 second clock and that should help in this situation but time the enemy and it's just you know there's so much nuance to the quarterback position and it everybody says well Trevor simians in a second year but he spent a whole year behind Peyton Manning and Brock Osweiler and watching those guys work and the whole time was taking mental reps this is all brandnew we've talked about the obstacles for for Paxton Lynch did he play great today no but again I'll tell you his future is bright there's no doubt about it 114 to play down 10 he's got the receivers for a quick strike and the arm but the pressure gets Tobin's thrown down at the 40 Grady Jared another Atlanta sax he's hanging on waiting for someone to come open no never came open and Grady Jarrett continues the onslaught on Paxton Lynch 6x4 the Falcons Booker has it gets over on the Atlanta side of the field at the 47 of the Falcons and on fourth down you can't spike it here but you your Lynch you want to get the first down he's we got the jump on the stab that's completed hit outbound centers things on as a flag after the hip we chronicled it earlier that's been his problem Robert Alford he does everything well except this he gets a lot of penalties here you see the hit but now he's going to play like Beckham it had to be at that point you're right the leg that's when the flag see the official right on it stops the clock moves the ball up and they're going to try a field goal with McManus here need to scores so you might as well get one out of the way and then see if you can connect on the onside kick and take a Hail Mary so he's got to make this from 45 that penalty helped the situation and get the upright and went through from 45 yards away it's up there it's out there and it's in their joint it counts seven point difference here comes another onside kick try you seen McManus he had a great first attempt it was called offsides but he put it up there high and next week the NFL on Fox start your Sunday with Fox NFL kickoff America's number one pregame show Rams and Lions on America's game of the week the Cowboys and Packers and the Falcons up in Seattle against the Seahawks and they're gonna head to Seattle right after this game stay out there all week and prepare for Seattle which had the weekend off you know what I love this about Dan Quinn as much as you know that to lessen the travel it's about connecting this team when you're off on the road together you got to spend time together you got to eat together Dan Quinn he's trying to forge that connection he came from Seattle where they had it he's trying to build that culture in my in Atlanta and he's doing a wonderful job of doing so they sent flowers to all the wives and family members to hang in there on the road trip the onside kick snack right away and Toyo the tightend Levine toy Lobo grabbed that to secure Atlanta's fourth straight victory morale the story don't onside kick to Stanford tight in the last to Austin hoot for Tallulah well the Falcons came in highest scoring team in the league they put 23 on the board still the most anybody scored against the Broncos this year and Gary Kubiak his ninegame winning streak with four different quarterbacks Paxton Lynch his first start today comes to an end on the Broncos the reigning Super Bowl champs slipped to four and one the Falcons after beating Carolina and now Denver knocking off the two Super Bowl teams of last year we'll have more from Denver in just a moment",

  "transcript": "you're confident lay it all on the line and we'll have your back up front Tom alrighty Aaron well we're gonna watch it all day long now the Packers won the toss saved the food to getting the football in the second half so we're going to see that man right from the getgo what an extraordinary year what an extraordinary career it is for the 27 year old Foley Alabama native Jones already won game this year incredibly over 300 receiving yards in one game we look at it just seven weeks into the season the guy is approaching and could get it here this afternoon a thousand yards receiving on the year he's had a great start not many teams can go against him and say that they've done a good job Mira Queens started his career with the Falcons left for a short while he's back in Atlanta Tyler Packer fans inside the George this late Sunday afternoon pretty fair quarterback in his own right 31 year old Philadelphia Pennsylvania native Matt how about his star Troy well he's coming off a couple tough games here in the last two weeks we're late in those games he's had interceptions which have ultimately led to them losing those games overall he's had a nice year you talked about it in the open he's without Tevin Coleman and so much attention to Julio Jones that Coleman is one of those guys who's awfully explosive out of the backfield don't miss him today without you reading in Russian picked up to the 38yard line now they brought in Alex Mack to firm up that offensive line but some bigtime weapons and already seen to a quick catch and I like Mohamed Sanu who you just saw catch that ball and he came over from Cincinnati he had a nice career over there and I think he gives them a dimension as a possession receiver as we just saw that helps complement the explosiveness of Julio Jones get it and he will slide up to very close to another first down depending on where they spot it you can bet that the Green Bay Packers are going to pull out of attention over to number 11 that's Julio Jones that's the guy they have to stop in this passion attack and Pat Ryan who doesn't run a lot but when it opens up he takes it and picks up a nice game fractionally enough for the first down so again a tenth of the line that's an incomplete pass this Packer defense you said in Troy you know they're great against arrived with Daniels and company the secondary is a big question well that is the question because Mike Daniels I think he's having a great year but how much is Atlanta going to try to run the football with a depleted secondary and right now they've come out throwing the football and I'm not surprised by that just underwent glowing surgery there without Quentin that on the heels as they stop the run there's a flag down but all of that on the heels of sand shields being concussed they're not quite sure when he'll be back so their top three quarterbacks are out with injuries going into this game today against Atlanta so they're asking Mike McCarthy alright what do you want to do you just stopped him illegal formation offense number 18 was covering number 80 that's a fiveyard penalty is still second down saying this is not a good start here for Atlanta on the opening possession to have a mentally like that this is a team that last week had four false start penalties playing at home and presnap penalties just kill you look at some of the names missing today including that man's Lee Matthews shields we talked about Rollins and Randle they're already down montgomery been the old the entire week rainbow Cobb we are very surprised by that decision when we got to the stadium today he's shown in the first town but they got a big chunk of it back Clinton dicks on the tackle there's a flag right in front of the Green Bay sideline for his side of the field looked like there was some movement prior to the snap and illegal formation number 77 of the offense was on the end of the line of scrimmage uncover 5yard penalty still second down but can't beat number 77 that's a defensive lineman Rasheed Haig that was inactive today this has got to be driving dad quit crazy I mean to have already commented on the previous penalty when you can't get lined up that would come back after a nice game to see you we're going backwards little tight in his Jacob Tamme he's having very nice to leer going back to his days Indianapolis Denver now his second year at Atlanta closing in on 260 career receptions he'd been a good player for a long time this he has and he's been a nice security blanket for man ride but right now we've got Dom Capers with a third and long and typically you would expect blitz but they're so shorthanded at the corner position he's had to back off that here in recent weeks who see what he decides to do here against Ryan looks like he's going to play coverage trips to the right big pressure Ryan steps up throws this tackle very close to a first got bolus Lucinda Packers have streaking as Clinton decks on his way to the end zone there's an injured player and we have a penalty flag down on the far side of the field there is not a penalty flag down there is a player down the question is was he down and did the ground caused the fumble it looked like it from that replay that's Tammy oh the kill was a completed pass and the runner was down by contact walk down and look to me like his elbow maybe was not couldn't tell exactly if the ball was coming out at that time or not Tom cami is still shaken up it'll be a fourth down in a yard hey knowing these Falcons they might go for it when we come back today's game is sponsored by Southwest yes the little bit of wood loving to hide that's transparency it was the fourth and one decision in overtime last Sunday against San Diego Atlanta failed San Diego not the ball went down the other end and picked the field goal to win it but they won't be denied this time they pitch it wide to the box a freeman and he has the first half so Dan Quinn is not going to stop being aggressive no and we could take another look at this Jacob Tamme initially it looks at me like the ball might have been coming out but he was down after we looked at it it was not challenged of course not surprised we see Tammy walking on the field not surprised that Dan Quinn decided to go for it there Nick Perry he bites here and he creates the edge Devonta Freeman he takes it and he's talked about Tevin Coleman his speed today but the bots a dream and he's got great speed is there to Tehran the orders in his second year he's not even active until today this season last year as a reserve got 29 carries caught nine passes out of the backfield but they like this secondyear player they like him he was in the offense last year he got some limited playing time so they bring him up and they're not afraid to get him in the game as we saw on talking with Kyle city and he said hey he's not going to WoW anybody but he's going to get to the right hole and be in the right place and just knowing that goes a long way not surprised and quintet for a fourth down they almost had to have to go on court over the line of scrimmage let's go downstairs and check in with Aaron on Jacob Tamme well Troy mentioned Tammy walking off the field going back into the locker room they're calling him questionable to return with a shoulder injury he's going to get xrays right now guys all right Aaron thank you very much all these offensive weapons on both teams and that would be another if Tammy is unable to return they're down at seven by Hooper the maqam Tynan and shot down by Demetri Goodson Goodson is in there as they started with all these injuries in a secondary of Demetri Goodson he comes up and he makes a nice tackle there to keep the Falcons from picking up the first down there on third down but earlier when they went for it on fourth the long third down situation ladarius Gunnar misses a tackle which kept this drive alive so a good stop defensively there by the Green Bay Packers 46 go go try by matt brien who has a chance today to become the Falcons alltime scoring leader and he's now one point away from breaking that record low and blackboard Manderson Rodgers and company on offense when we come back trailing three nothing today's game is sponsored by Bud Light make the right call drink responsibly a lot of youngsters families here today we talked about the large contingent of Packer fans where they love their package no matter where you go they travel well I know when we when I was in Dallas the two teams that we would face it traveled awfully well where the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Green Bay Packers they do a great job of an awesome fan base Cowboys too for that matter the back part of the end zone and here comes a 32 year old Chico California native first round pick in 2005 Aaron Rodgers a team record 39 completions against Chicago in the wind last Thursday night and I say I went down I was talking there before the game I don't know if Aaron really has or what his expectations are for this game his offense and he skill players and really look they're a change seemingly from week loser top two running backs that come into this game thinking the one after again while throwing the football without two guys are such a big part of that they have to go back to being a little more balanced or at least changing to be a misty receiver that's good brandnew running backs after injuries Lacey and starts you trying to bring those two young running backs up to speed you know we heard Erin Andrews and you know get with them and yeah they were going to play already but that role changes significantly once you lose your top two guys in Randall Cobb he's been nursing a hamstring for several weeks and it finally got the best up he just has not been the same player for quite some time little delayed handoff to Jackson good positive yardage here the Pao pushes it forward and that will be enough for a first down for the rookie Dodd Jackson for more on the Packers rookie running back let's check in with Erin Andrews and Aaron Rodgers told us it's going to be Nile Davis and Don Jackson that looked to be big factors today they did spend an hour with Aaron last night in his room going over the playbook hearing from TJ laying the biggest thing for Davis and Jackson patience wait for the blocks to develop wait to see the defense don't get too excited out there guys Thanks here that's a nice start right there for Jackson I mean you make ya look real good Green 18 so how about Davis books read well you think about it I really believe that they're going to have to show more balance than what they anticipated coming into this game with the injuries that we've talked about Niles Davis what's interesting about him as the Packers go out and make a trade with Kansas City for him the first trade that the Packers had made since 2010 Wow they just don't do that very often but obviously they desperately needed one they went into this season with just two running backs on their roster that's very unusual with any Lacy and James Starks then you lose both of them are you trying to bring young guys up to speed let's Nile Davis in motion ready there's Jordy Nelson he's inside the 20 run out of bounds inside the ten Nelson trying to shake off the rust from that injury a season ago he started this year very well has been very quiet until now he starts on the left side he runs a deep crossing route to the opposite flag and this is the defense that has given up a lot of big plays in the passing game in their zone skis you see Keanu Neal who he he doesn't anticipate that Jordy Nelson's going to keep going he gets by him the hole in the zone Rodgers takes a hit late but that ball was thrown right on the money and stride and we haven't seen a play like that from this offense in quite young you are not lined you took the words right out of my mouth they have been few and far last week Aaron Rodgers comes out he throws it 56 times and that ballgame against the Chicago Bears over the last three weeks he's averaged 48 passing attempts again and they've had to do what they what they've had to do in order to try to move the football and it looked coming into this game it was going to be much of the same I know what visiting with Mike McCarthy he anticipated 4245 throws in this game but I think with those young backs especially some of the runs we've already seen let's see if maybe you can't get the running game for this offensive line great pass protectors they move people out of the run game to Davante Adams in the backfield right now Raja's looked at him initially zoning out as a touchdown for Jordy Nelson so for an offense without Randall Cobb without ty Montgomery without Eddie Lacy without James Starks without Jared Cook that's a pretty impressive beginning yes it is and you can see Jordy Nelson he just finds the hole in his own and no linebacker picks him up and Aaron Rodgers he didn't have to escape the pocket you leave the pocket to buy yourself some time let your receivers work the middle of the field and he finds Nelson for the touchdown he's already got more two catches today than he had all last week position has been money in the bank for these Packers that's four touchdowns to go along with two field goals on their first possession of the game the homerun ball to Towson put it all on the team and they cap it off Rodgers to Nelson seven three pack today's game on Fox is sponsored by Bank of America by Taco Bell's world chicken tacos and by Chevrolet more 2016 chibi power dependability Awards than any other brand well the last time these two teams got together it was a wild one up in Lambeau Field they see that drive took you six play 75 yards 58 of it on the past and Nelson when you talk about the Packers and them not scoring a lot of points on average it's because they haven't had a lot of big plays they get a big play that come away with a touchdown still to speak returns it close to the 30yard line America's game of the week off to a quick start Rodgers leads a Packers on a touchdown the Nelson Falcons be looking for answers early on Atlanta second possession on offense first drive stolen inside the 15 and led to a bad Brian field goal so Matt why doctors Dan crossing mattered first catch of the afternoon for Julio Jones let's go back to that long one too Jordy Nelson well here's Ricardo Al and they're gonna rent Jordy Nelson on the deep crosser and then they bring him up on the dig route and it puts Ricardo Allen in a real tough position because he's got to play the deepest guy he just doesn't know initially who exactly that's going to be anticipating two verticals up the seam that's how Jordy Nelson gets open and then here's the touchdown and said Jordy Nelson just one reception in that win against the Bears last week but he has a nice start to this game with a big play that helps set up that touchdown himself first elegant he takes a couple of tacklers and he has another pairs down at the Packer territory to the 47 slip away from the rookie linebacker Blake Martinez this Julio Jones I said it coming into the game I think he's the best at footballing he's got unbelievable strength and speed he there's nothing that he can't do and the thing that I like the most in visiting with Matt Ryan about him just as far as the type of guy he is he says that he's the most unselfish player that he's been around you don't hear that very often about a lot of superstars in his name see looking down the field Gabriel 47 yards how about that talked about it and said Tyler Gabriel is one of the guys young player that can blow the top off the defense and you see the job that he does getting down the field Demetri Goodson but Matt Bryan has to put this ball perfectly and allow Gabriel to go get it the coverage really was not that bad you see the throw here from Matt Ryan he has to split the two defenders he makes a perfect throw beating the ball with haha Clinton Dix that's a heck of a throw by Matt Ryan and let his guy Taylor Gabriel go get her now by Bryant will barely ten minutes into this long ball the Gabriel riot and the Falcons answer right back Tayler Gabriel his first touchdown reception of the year you know this guy did some nice Saints in Cleveland and may turn out to be a pretty savvy pick up by these Falcons it's been dinged up this year but active today and the touchdown reception beautifully thrown ball butcher was at Demetri Goodson he plays outside leverage here which pipe alignment he's going to give Gabriel the inside now ha Clinton Dix tries to come off he's helping to the outside this was not his responsibility he's trying to get back in the action he's unable to but Matt Ryan in order to beat that coverage you have to lay it to the inside and let your guy go get it and it's a simply a footrace to the perfect execution perfect bro and of course to get that ball down the field you got to have protection up front and the Falcons came into this game leading the NFL Pass plays of twenty yards or more they're going to take their shots and this time they make Green Bay pay Rogers Great Britain they throw now rolls throws ha had an open Trevor Davis let's say hello for the first time today back in Los Angeles to charissa Thompson hi Carissa hi Tom Oakland that Tampa Bay under two minutes left in overtime this thing went back and forth but it ends like this Derick cars 41 yard touchdown passes set the Roberts Raiders win in overtime 30 24 they're now 5 and OH on the road Toms way Marisa thanks Troy Dolan now behind New England the secondbest record in the AFC belongs to Oakland pretty incredible what if with Jack Del Rio has been able to do you hear Kris at Thompson 500 on the road I mean it's harder to win it's hard to win on the road and they have yet to Liddy yes and he'll pick up close to five third down and five up coming now this Atlanta defense they've got good production a healthy big big Beasley jr. leaves and it's act with a secondary choice mint a problem yeah they they've given up big plays I think they've got good players in the secondary I think you got good corners I think they've got good safeties they're young guys as we know really this key fancy they play a lot of zone coverage backers are as young as the Falcons are sometimes you leave some holes within those islands and tenza Bay would exploit that we saw that already you know with the Green Bay Packers doing it but they'll continue to get better as they move through the year put it down right there and that's already the third catch of the afternoon for Jordy Nelson now we were you know we were at Green Bay a couple of weeks ago Rogers wasn't throwing the ball like he's throwing it at least in the first quarter today though he's turned it loose and we saw missed the ball high when he scrambled the play ago but this was money again right on the sidelines and you know I think as I said about Aaron Rodgers that you get into games like this and you're without two top guys and you know sometimes your best games come when you least expect them and so far here today hey that's been true the Baron Rodgers he's off to a great start to Adams right at midfield and that's another Green Bay first and then em all was cut loose and it's the one thing I think that people when they've watched this passing attack the ball just has not come out as quickly is what we've seen in years past but you know that time Rogers hits his back foot and he lets it fly and I can tell you that right now with the start that knee has had he's feeling pretty good about the way this game has begun ready go take that put it there the catch is made and that's Davis Reverend Davis of would be on account same alma mater is the era nuraghes those protections unbelievable the protection is really good but as you see receivers when your quarterback is scrambling you've got to work back towards them and you know you finally are able to locate Davis but too many times when I see these scramble drills it's not just a freeforall there are rules within a scramble that receiver should employ and I don't see it from the Packers they don't work back towards Rogers and too many times with a lot of time nobody's doing what they can to find separation where he'd go with someone with ball there you go don't know if they got it off in time I guess they get his first catch of the afternoon there's another guy they're hoping can step up you know they they released here at Avril Daris last time we saw Aaron Rodgers he thought Afra Daris might be able to help but he's been injured in a hurry up mode and plays blown dead Rodgers wondering why timeout was called by Atlanta prior to the ploy this is the first charge timeout Atlanta 10 7 Atlanta go back to America's game of the week here on Fox Derek Carr leading the Raiders to a six and two bar top rated Wow just running it up on Rex Ryan in the bills and over 500 passing yards for cousins in a tie over in London to the Redskins and Bengals another missed field goal that would have won the game and we saw a lot of old boys not fun Arizona could talk to that after last Sunday's match up a lot of missed chicks in this past week seven play the drive Raja's there's a penalty flag down that steve andre campbell the rookie linebacker out of Minnesota holding number 69 offense 10yard penalty still force down that's left tackle David bakhtiari but here's the von Drake Campbell and see he's got great speed really both these rookie linebackers that they drafted this year have great speed hard to outflank and moves a scream the entire way see the hold there by Bakhtiari this defense for Atlanta six guys six starters of the 11 first four secondyear players and it was a defense that in 2014 the year before Dan Quinn got named the head coach is worst defense in football so last year they got it back to respectability they've had some some growing pains this year but he is slowly getting the personnel that he wants he wants fast flowing defenders that play physical and aggressive and slowly but surely is getting those guys in here the other top of the line second down not only all the changes in all the youth but you go back to Devon Dre Campbell rookie middle linebacker Deon and Jones rookie all these guys in this playing time is well with injury so there's been very little time where everybody's been together which is wide and credibly said us he believes they will move in the direction you're talking about and the injuries to those linebackers is why they've had to play know so much young coverage and and why they've had some of the holes that that they've had inside a charity and another big play for an offense and those have been few and far between this year we have it's really playing well well he starts in the backfield so now they've got Davante Adams playing the position that we've seen from time Montgomery a missed tackle there and it allows Adams n did you see Keanu Neill you know he's he's one of those physical young players he just does not take a good angle and he gets beaten it ends up being a big play for Green Bay this is the end of the first quarter so they'll change to the feet great start to this one Fox NFL Sunday continues after these messages in a word from your local Fox station ten seven and lanta leading Green Bay backers said for their 9th play on this drive which began on their own 25 covering 53 yards thus far again incredible protection davus and he's very close to a first down to the 15 we started to mention the last team these teams played was a Lambeau Field there's only two years ago 43 to 37 was a final the Packers won that game Ryan threw for 375 Rodgers threw for 327 Julio Jones set a franchise record until this year with 259 receiving yards and Jordy Nelson went for 146 so the 259 yards by Julio Jones certainly got Dom Capers attention coming on this game let's Davante Adams he's coming off the best game in his career against Chicago thirteen catches 132 yards and two touchdowns I mean this was as good as a guess snow coming down cold and Lambeau Ryan and Julio hooking up 11 times for 259 yards in a touchdown but Rodgers and the Packers came out on top we've seen Taylor Gabriel he had the the touchdown but typically when you're talking about the big plays of the Atlanta Falcons they're going to Julio Jones number 11 so to have some his first career catch a short while ago and now he's inside the 5yard line this has really been impressive granted we're early in the second quarter but with all the pieces missing from this offense they've got it going pretty good and they were lying on as you said Trevor Davis here the fifth round pick and this guy can absolutely fly he's a 43 guy that's what the organization likes about him and he's going to get some respect he should draw some soft coverage work no not down here but as we move through this game we should be able to work some of the underneath things but I think Mike McCarthy not just today but I think the last few weeks with injuries I think he's really managed the offense very well bastiana catcha there's Dionne Jones dynamic rookie out of LSU incredible athlete he was not a starter in Clemson until his senior year played four years for the Tigers but did not start until his last year there this is an area of the field for Atlanta where they have struggled this year they've not been good down here in the red zone keeping teams out of the end zone 11 of 12 days on this Drive throwing the hipbone ready Nelson Jones here to break it up one of the real nice moments in this season let's go back to this play a minute ago just trying to uncover Nelson with the ball and good coverage underneath from the linebacker talking about earlier Keyon John Jones a young fellow grew up in New Orleans and his family was forced to move after Katrina earlier this year when they played in New Orleans he had a touchdown okay throws to the end zone and that is a touchdown geronimo geronimo allison just brought up after a great preseason they had to turn him loose they activate him this week off the practice squad had a run of OED well granted Aaron Rodgers for keeping the play alive he's able to move up in the pocket and then slide in Geronimo uncovers himself you talked about it coming out of camp they kept seven wide receivers he was the eighth and so he got released he got signed this week to replace Abra Daris he just got himself a touchdown can you imagine the hay here Packer fans what a great day Geronimo today's game on Fox is sponsored by Nissan innovation that excites by the blue cash every day card from American Express and by the new bacon King sandwich only at Burger King the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum located in we're about two miles from downtown Atlanta our crew led by Richie Sian spent a lot of time over there of the weekend to the end zone there's a penalty flag down I think it's offsides against a kicking team like somebody started too early offside number 29 of the kicking team that Lana has elected the fiveyard penalty from the touchback spot it will be first down at the 30 yard line let's the backup running back to Ron Wood we'll go back and take a look at it in good protection as Rogers steps up and slides and Geronimo Allison opens up inside initially Rogers was looking to Jordy Nelson and Deon Jones gets a hand right to the head gear Jordy was plating this case with his official Apple on first down back to knee and throwing his hands into the air is Gunther as he was running step for step with Julio Jones let's take a look at it there's double coverage and see much there right because you know where the ball was thrown if anything maybe it's on Julio Jones but fast really see much there 36 defense first down at the spot of the foul you know he hadn't Julio Jones hasn't been getting a lot of those calls the last few weeks and Dan Quinn has been upset about it as you take a look at a couple of those when calls could have been made for defensive pass interference and this time he does get the call but I think it was a bad one I don't really see much there about you Tom but I thought Garth was running weathermen if there was any contact initiated who's from Julio it's a 24 yard penalty that's close to attend your game eight five tonight the Indians trying to close it out looking for their first World Series title since 1948 Jon Lester trying to keep the Cubs hopes alive that's tied after football on and he appears to have another first down to the 25 yard this may turn into a shootout I like that game in 2014 I mean the way this first half has gone both these offenses have been able to move the ball of course we expected that from Atlanta Oh he's tripped up guy on is there along with Jake Ryan's secondyear linebacker out of Michigan yeah well this this run defenses is awfully good for the Green Bay Packers really nobody with the exception of Dallas who ran the ball awfully well and 190 yards two weeks ago in that game rushing but outside of that it's been a pretty tough defense in most big guys in the middle they're hard to move one Russian defense allowing 71 yards per game less certain that's like one again there's that packet one stingy swarming defense led by Ryan and Micah hi and then let's not forget there without Clay Matthews and one of the reasons they've been so good and run defense they do a good job setting the edge now this time you're able to see him get out on the edge Freeman's able to but the pursuit inside out this Packers defense is exceptional the effort that you see from them is incredible each week and there's clay Mathews who he's been battling no hamstring issues really pretty much throughout his career but they desperately miss him no question has he had a chance to play against his cousin today the left Falcons escaped that so third down Brian steps up that's Jones and that's excellent coverage and an excellent tackle made by ladarius Gunther so out comes a field goal unit gunner may have gotten away with a little something there or the tug on the Jersey and so he gave Julio one and then they didn't catch him on that one so evened up the score but the Packers now a couple different times on these possessions have gotten the Falcons into third and long and Dom Capers is play coverage and they've made key stops and enforced Matt Bryan on the field for a field goal the alltime spoiled today is past morten andersen and this one from 40 out is right down the middle duchess saying well you got one i got away with one both quarterbacks off to spectacular stein so far today yeah this has been a good start for both of those guys and as we talked about with matt ryan you kind of expected that right against his defense in their secondary and having to rely on their fourth and fifth corners and but for aaron rodgers to find out you're going into this ball game without Randall Cobb and Ty Montgomery who've been such a big part for him to come out look the way that he has in the offense has that's been impressive like every time we toss it down to air and we're talking about injuries therefore how about a doctor all right doctor let's get that update on old Randall Cobb you know we knew he was limited in practice this week with a hamstring injury and this was something he injured a couple weeks ago against the New York Giants he told me he thought there was a chance he'd be able to go today but because the Packers already had their bye week and may have a couple more weeks to go here he said there's no really reason to chance it they have to let it heal I stated balm you know Allison playing in his first NFL game a college free agent out of Illinois scored his first touchdown on his first catch a moment ago well I got all the respect for Randall Cobb I mean perhaps for him to be able to try to cut through that injury here over the last few weeks it's one thing for a quarterback to do it when you don't have to just take off the ground for a wide receiver to do it with a poor hamstring Jack to the file pushes him forward up to the 28 yard line Jonathan Babineaux in an attack no but you could tell watching him that he just wasn't guessing he wasn't as explosive they didn't have the cuts and the quickness is your custom the seen and so I think the Packers that all these games are important but he has to get healthy because he's such a big part of what they do and he's a dynamic player when he is healthy well you know his last three games he has 27 catches coming off a spectacular game against Chicago Bram's 95yard packers in that game had three different players with 10 or more Rossetti's Rodgers cuts it loose just out of the reach of Jordy Nelson well we talked about the job that Mike McCarthy has had to do here in the last few weeks with so many injuries and in this game you know we've seen ty Montgomery and Randall Cobb in that back mill position today we just saw that last play Richard Rodgers he starts in the backfield prior to that Devante Adam so they have come out with four wide receivers one tight end five wide receivers and no backs and they've employed the players in those positions in the backfield like they have Richard Rodgers is the one back here now if this offensive chance back is to of to on third down so far Rogers flush down keeps the play alive but now he's down at the 19 that is Vic Beasley jr. seven and a half sex for the number one pick a year ago Courtney Upshaw forrest rodgers right back into Beasley yeah he's the one who got the inside pressure because it had Rodgers it had time in the pocket to step up he's got an open man I believe it was Jordy Nelson who's walking across the middle but Upshaw gets a direct path and Aaron Rodgers had no opportunity except a 22 yard line is down two flags down Wayne's telling his feet up to the 33 yard line and we wait on pair of penalty flags right around where wings caught the football and then the other thrown as he started into his return we're talking about big Beasley jr. and you made the comment and a great article about him in the paper that you said you're a big fan is all of a sudden well I already was but a bigger fan now guy likes country music on the team both by the receiving team holding number 29 of the receiving team that penalty is declined holding during the return number 36 of receiving team tenyard penalty from the end of the run to the end of the spot of the foul forced down there's one of them and energy other there's Pisa trying to get up Rogers didn't like that it looked like very much Georgetown black maybe a gain of two illegal formation with these pin number eleven is covering number 80 so fiveyard penalty is still forced down let's headed back to Los Angeles and check in with Curt Menefee are on costly interception in many ways san diego's Poteau River is picked off by Denver's Bradley Roby he returns at 49 yards for the Pick six Denver leads in ten seven but on the return on the sidelines defensive coordinator Wade Phillips was run over looks like a master looking leg injury he's out of the game will update you gonna be so hot first at fifteen couch gain of five made by Austin Hooper the rookie out of stanford you know you go back to last week in the fourth quarter trying to seal the game Ryan the first down pedaling second down they go for first out again another penalty so it becomes first in 20 and ultimately it turns out you know Matt Ryan threw the penalty in Troy when you're in the in the in the huddle and you're getting the penalties over and over and over presnap penalties often times from your offensive latin what do you say well I can't say that's completely unacceptable you can't have it I mean it's one thing if you have holding penalties and you know effort Clint penalties but when you can't get lined up where you have false starts to lack of concentration it's not knowing your assignments and just not not really paying attention and that's what losing football is about this is a team that has lost the last two games Atlanta Falcons one of the reasons they lost last week's game was because they had some false starts like you talked about and it forced Matt Ryan try to force and throwing misses a guy it's intercepted and then San Diego once again are you talking about that Felicia threading the needle that's what Ryan did there I'm not even sure Jones knew that ball could get to him well you see the release and the quickness and ladarius gunner he's just trying to hold on for his life you know he is getting help as you see you've got safety help over the top Julio Jones is he sees that every week he's going to see it again every snap here today and he's a guy who takes some punishment and he's so physical that sometimes his own body can he was skating when he puts it through but what a great player he is falcons gave up a lot to get him in that draft but he's looked up to it quick slant daddy trying to find all drink Robinson so a good defensive stand there by the Green Bay Packers aided by a pair of penalties by the Atlanta Falcons and very slowly walking around on that sideline is their great star Julio Jones well he's on the injury report just about every week you know they got to do what they can to manage him and get him to Sunday's and not always easy to do but he's a gamer just blasting Davis uh he's across the 50 and Davis down the sideline cuts it back to the inside and finally tackled in a 15 yard line no penalty flags on the field well you talk about a waiter to jump onto the active roster Davis already a pair of catches and now this huge return to 55 he talked about his speed just a little bit earlier he just flat runs away from people he's catching it a dead stop guys have runs at him and poor angles and he's able to flip the field position on them and here's a look at Julio Jones maybe why he's over on the sidelines as you see he's hobbled a good ankle and left ankle got rolled up underneath the MS he is going to the ground by Davis long as that Falcons cut return pensee rendered collectively every punt return against him all year who Rajesh is receiver for Nelson doubleteamed in the back to the inzone mana Falcons blood coverage team have been the best in the league before that one from Davison they continue to look at Jones that sure helps out your offense you know for the Packers we were able to get returns like that and like I said earlier as well this this defenses had some problems down here in the red zone being able kick the end zone get back here that suck again collapses at Rogers mill what a flag down still on his feet wrapped up by Jones have been a linebacker but we wait on the penalty based on Aaron Rodgers sounds like he's saying that there was defensive holding on the play there's a lot of John going down there too and Rogers right in the middle of all Rogers can outrun a lot of people but he ain't gonna run out Iran deal Jack was in the pocket holding number 34 defense the five yard penalty from first down the wiki is playing regularly not a Florida Bryant pool he's right here on the slide he's a nickel corner he got his right arm up around Jordy Nelson snag a kick it was a good call and here's the the stiff arm by Aaron Rodgers but he doesn't get much out of that game Deon Jones as we spoke about he can flatout wrong five ten to go until halftime thank you Dad no city look like it went out of bounds before the Falcons had the ball and I think Green Bay's gonna get it back the whistle was blown with no one maintaining possession so it sure sounded like the ball is going to roll down bones and maintain possession by the Packer defensive player was out of bounds when the ball was touched its makes the ball out of bounds it's second down Green Bay how about that right there you're gonna see is tried to get to it before coming down out of bounds so the fumble was caused at the three but it went out of bounds at the nine a second ago great I could get again that is a touchdown three by Rogers and Atwood he's already had his first catch Davis started this drive with a big punt return and he ends it with his first career touchdown this is what we got used to seen from Aaron Rodgers that falls perfectly placed on the pie line he left pylon he lets his guy go get it but you get an up field rusher from the defensive end and Rodgers slides up and then out we've seen that over and over and over it's his signature move as a quarterback step up slide out buys him some time and throws a dart for the touchdown of course they were making sure the Davis came down cleanly with the ball they've already looked at it he set it up with that return and he finishes it off we saw in the Packers two weeks ago when they were roughed up by Dallas and Aaron Rodgers did not have a good game at least her nearly half today he has been money in the bank today's game is sponsored by Miller Life the original light beer well what a start to this one for Aaron Rodgers in the Green Bay Packers missing just huge important parts of their offense Randall Cobb but the big story right now is when we come back is Julio Jones able to come back into the game we'll let you know in just a moment Julio Jones in the game Aaron yeah you can see him stretching out the right knee there was a lot of conversation with the athletic trainers and doctors about the outside of the right knee they checked him out he's been limping and stretching but he's still out there as we see to this game Ryan Devonta Freeman people forget Freeman rushed for over a thousand yards last year he also had 73 receptions he's a good receiver as his Tevin Coleman and that's how they utilize these guys and they're able to take advantage of some of that underneath coverage he's fans up coming into this game with a hip injury of his own the other lady hillford there with each ID that's a first down up to the 49 yard line for Austin Hooper we haven't seen a lot of this but Dom Capers this time he does bring extra rushers and they're able to get home and force the ball out of Matt Ryan's hands so he mixes it up there but for the most part was the completed secondary he's had to back off doing some of the things that typically you'd see him do they get to treatment by Jakob riot as he stayed with Hooper all along and here's a penalty flag on the play personal foul roughing the passer unnecessary late hit number 95 just in your tunnel first down let's date on Jones who's coming off his most active game of the year against Chicago silly I couldn't tell if it was really you know he drops the crown of his helmet but I didn't see real contact from the helmet it was more shoulder and after saying that it was just late for that it was more to the head and neck area I don't know it didn't look like much to me but the balls out they're going to give the benefit of the doubt to the quarterback let's see what you say Gabriel was always so fleetfooted Gabriel he really did have a quarterback to throwing the ball and Leland he still managed to put together a couple of seasons you know 30 to 40 receptions well he has a quarterback they can get in the ball now if he's on the field Jones at the top here and mortgage burned them to run him down at the 21 yard line second Adam coming this game as well sitting winds down here to the twominute warning but this is a good drive for the Atlanta Falcons so we've reached the twominute warning of a very exciting first half you're watching America's game of the week on Fox follow your favorite team all season long go to itunes comm slash NFL now we showed you the one play we thought Jones may have been shaken up on the Troy might have been earlier nat yeah this is a play that happened even prior to the one that we showed it could be a cumulative effect that said he's he's a physical guy he's not a hundred percent not many of these guys are but it happen especially coming into the game he's bent a little bit clearly how about the day being put together so far by Austin Hooper he had six catches this entire season and he has four so far today you can see what the play action does here and it opens things up and there it gives him the lane to get the ball into Hooper Julio Jones excellent release off the line of scrimmage there but he kind of grabs at it as he comes out of that break certainly didn't keep him from making the plan but it's that left ankle that appears to be the problem get to the road second and goal one minute to go here in the second quarter Falcons have two timeouts left try to wind this thing down I know visiting with Kyle Shan and he talked about the importance of continuing to stick with the running game even if they weren't having a lot of success they don't feel they can hold up in pass protection if they abandon it completely there's a shot of Collin Shanahan who I think does an outstanding job course he learned a lot of what he knows from his father Roy was one of the great offensive minds as well but they'd run the ball well when they drive it I was just a seven rushing playing for the Falcons David finds the endzone that's a beautifully designed play by Shanahan and company getting into the hand to the playmaker Freeman and that's his second receiving touchdown of the year well they split Devonta Freeman out you can see the linemen get out in front but initially it looked like the Packers had Freeman bottled up but he's able to knife his way in there that's it that's an excellent job finishing off this Drive the Packers have been able to force it are able to complete the drivein at six points and they're going to go for two and try and tie the game up they are to a twopoint conversion so far in this season they get trips to the right similar Jones and Gabriel but covered by the land I look like Julius Peppers stripped it away well it looked like Ryan had Devonta Freeman wide open and maybe just didn't see him for the touchdown to the field they went trips and the Packers really did not roll coverage that way they played oneonone but Matt Ryan was not working that side at all he was trying to work the isolation round back to his tight end and then just good coverage he's trying to get the ball to Hooper but it was good coverage by the Packers and then just nothing there but I thought he was gonna try to work that trip side with the single coverage that he had they'll have time right around the corner what's coming up mr. Minetti all right coming up on the VESA halftime another week another tie Oakland and Tampa comes very close to one and Cleveland had a big lead did they get their first win make sure you join me and the guys on the visa halftime my current looking forward to that so the twopoint conversion fails but under four minutes 75 yards eight plays Freeman the touchdown catch Ryan touchdown 16 of 20 183 yards and for Matt Ryan he came into the game trailing only true Brees for the NFL lead in touchdown passes with 16 final round of the FIFA World Cup qualifiers kicks off with a bitter odds the United States of America take on Mexico coverage begins November 11th 7:00 Eastern on FS 1 of watching live on Fox Sports go can't do much better than that two good hands by this or good half by both of these quarterbacks and Green Bay does get the ball to start the second half so we'll see what they elect to do but I would think I try something here on first down so they get something rolling with two timeouts still loud but they will possess the ball and start the next pretty he's got a lot of he's up to the 50 yard line and there's 18 seconds left that's better than a long pass boy that was pretty good at it they go into man coverage and as I said earlier in this game they don't run a lot of it it's a lot of zone coverages that they they run but Rodgers recognizes that all these defensive backs have their back to him and there's nobody out in front of him he takes it that's his longest run of the year 23 yards Mason Crosby loose on a sideline Packers have two timeouts left ready as Nelson they'll call the timeout down to the 30yard line eight seconds remain stick a fork in it they rushed three and so Rogers had some time I couldn't tell if there was a hand on it by truth water I don't think so I just kind of got up on Jordy Nelson but he sticks with a great concentration being able to haul it in if he's able to catch that on the run clean he had a lot of field out in front of them by Troy let me ask you now you have one timeout left you have less than 10 seconds what are you thinking here right now well you want to try to pick up some more yardage out of this but you've got a timeout left so you just got to no Aaron Rodgers and he does that the balls got to come out quick you can't run around and let the time expire and if the ball is completed in bounds the receiver has to know unless he's going to score a touchdown he's got to get on the ground allow you to call the timeout to stop the clock maybe about a 4950 in Smith Kowski and a flag comes in play had been blown dead wisely rip Kowski slides down they use your flushes unnecessary roughness number 22 defense after this is for the goal automatic first down you see roof Kowski he does go to the ground and he's trying to give himself up and Keanu Neal he comes in after the fact leaves with his shoulder to the head and that's that's what drew the panel Nia I think it's hard on these guys it's easy in slow motion to point those things out I think it's really hard on these defenders when they're coming in trying to make stops and a guy decides to slide give himself up in here I think the penalty was warranted but I don't think that Keanu mill came in and was trying to do anything malicious 29 yard field goal try by Mason the opening half it is good thrilling first half here in Atlanta we're gonna send it to Kurt the gang in Los Angeles 24:19 Packers in front at halftime his excitement brought to you by the new Nissan Titan by the dude Nissan Titan back alongside the halloffamer Troy Aikman and Erin Andrews Thom Brenneman Titans at quarterback two of the best Packers and the Falcons talking about Aaron Rodgers and Matt Ryan and especially not to take anything away from Ryan but we talked about at the beginning of the game with so many weapons missing this has been an incredible first half of the Green Bay offense well I don't know what anyone was expecting but I certainly didn't expect that kind of performance from the Packers offense because of the injuries Aaron Rodgers found seven different receivers in that first half spread it around got Jordy Nelson of all big plays down the field only handed the ball off to a running back on six plays and Aaron Rodgers who scrambled twice out rushed all of them combined so a heck of a first half by the quarterback who was a little uncertain as to what exactly was going to occur out here without so many of his weapons but that was a good half for him and it was a good half also for his counterpart Matt Ryan passages three touchdowns now to the 25 comes riders in the pack and we check in with Erin and I have to be honest with all these injuries I haven't seen Green Bay happy in quite this time as they left the field Aaron Rodgers was pumped out Mike McCarthy was smiling he said it was very happy with the way the often spread out the field love the protection by the offensive line but said we have got to run the ball here in the second half Dan Quinn defensively told me with Aaron Rodgers feeling this good and looking this hot out there on the field he said we have got to get some turnovers right Aaron thank you so much those are the numbers on Rodgers mention to three touchdowns to two runs in the big one they're the final drive in the half which led to that field goal and the since 2419 advantage well if you come into a half hoping for turnovers by the Packers that's a lot of wishful thinking on most afternoons they do as good a job as anybody year in and year out protecting the football Aaron Rodgers is just four interceptions on a season money great protection again standing coverage by Robert Alford on Jordy Nelson Albert is just a spectacular athlete for 340 has a vertical leap of better than 41 inches talk about strong at the combine I mean for a guy that weighs 185 pounds he ripped off 17 reps at 225 pounds on the bench press they drafted those two corners back in 2013 they got output in the second round they grabbed the true font the first and ready is it two guys they believe her cornerstones for this defense and what Brendan Quinn wants to do then chase Rogers he dies forward after a hot sake short of a first down depending on where they will spot it looks like the 33 so they'll be too short of a first down third down coming up see Aaron Rodgers once again taking off running they say rushed all the running backs combined Mike McCarthy said that they have to run the ball well six of them there in the first half another golden Miles Davis Jaxson nice and lacy Instax 32 first and good coverage there by the rookie pool but they didn't need much no it was good coverage and it was good timing from Rodgers to Davante Adams and I think this is one of the areas where Davante Adams is is really grown as a receiver his route running has improved dramatically here in his third season and I thought last year watching him but you know he was not a very disciplined brother but most of it really had to do his struggles with just not being healthy I know you talk to anybody in the organization they're really has improved primarily because to the first time a long time caution against generously Chicago and that's witkowski so they call a running point and the big fella who only has one two carries today that gives him a doll a year that's a 12yard gain ripped house came out of the University of Oklahoma and he I was speaking earlier about the fact they broke can but they only had two running backs on their roster and that being Eddie Lacy and James Starks isn't they like what's happening over there with ripped aus key but he's a guy who as we saw whom he's capable he doesn't get he's capable of running the football a little bit like with John Coon was that group Kowski beats Coon out for the roster spot but who was that type of guy very versatile really that Alison opened at the 42yard line on a passing attempt today by Raju second in 10 the under pressure and then when trying to shore up that outside pass rush and just not allow Rodgers to escape the pocket throughout the first half and now on that play also he's able to escape but it puts that defensive back in a really tough position to stay on there guys with all the zone coverage that they run they have protected Rogers very well that sacked one time getting rid of it quickly into the hands of Adams what a tackle right there that could have been a huge game Keanu Neal for a minute it looked like Davante Adams was going to break this tackle John O'Neil comes in and has the punch at the ball as he comes in to make the play was able to get Davante Adams to graph so right now a big third down here for this Atlanta Falcons team they give the ball with not much time in the half and they give up three points to keep from giving up points on this drives gonna be a big place third and six trying to get him on a hard camp yeah it was good job byebye Rogers a lot of times when you're on the road especially in the dome you can't use the hardcamp but we heard Rogers use it today's team is sponsored by Southwest pistol Affairs with nothing to hide that's transparency by the allnew 2017 Ford Super Duty this is the next level and by fantastic beasts and where to find them explore a whole new era of the Wizarding World November 18 coming up tonight Game five Cubs on the ropes trailing three games to one but they'll head it to China Lester Lester did not have a good start is only started this year's World Series but through his career he has been an outstanding postseason pitcher they need tonight right 3d under the Dagon the story down in 6 trying to get to Rogers and they get to lodges Adrian playboy in the former number one pick of Tampa Bay he is healthy again and Dan Quinn says keep an eye on this guy Quinn dials it up it brings the pressure and there's a crosser that comes in front of Rodgers who's got it he's got a chance if he if Rogers gets it out to him quickly but instead he hangs on to it and the pocket collapses you see Rodgers was expecting a hole to be called that's a great stop defensively by the Falcon this is for a season they can't find the ball there's a missed chance right there by Janus they should have been pinned inside the five Julio Jones he worked on him at halftime taking some hard falls awkward falls in the game so far today and we'll see what he has in attack the big play courts down the field from Taylor Gabriel but this defense focused on Julio Jones coming in know that they've got to be able to control him within that passing game and they've done that he had three catches twenty nine yards there that in that first half so Green Bay's got to be pleased with how they've been able to handle him now they they know what Gabriel's capable capable of doing with the speed that he has we still gotta minimize his big plays for us to force it in there and broken up by Blake Martinez a rookie starting linebacker out of Stanford he's been a good addition to this defense I know I was talking to Mike Daniels down there on the on the field before the game this run defense when Clay Matthews is playing Nick Perry who's having a great year and then the two big guys inside but feels that the difference in their defense this year against the run has been the contributions by Blake Martina that's high praise for the rookie linebacker got a block big time block still on his feet it is up to the 26 yard line say Austin hooker is really having a nice game whether it's catching balls to have a field or make it a block that gets into a little room right there he's played in every game this year but has not been as featured as he is today Hooper one of those one of those young players that they're relying on it but he's a versatile guys primarily receiver but he's gotten better as a blocker black comes down ball stripped away it looked like Daytona Jones who had that penalty earlier in the game knocked it out of the hands of Ryan it's recovered by Atlanta but I think well we do have a flag and Jones may have started too soon it looked to me like he did and he they're gonna get together and talk about it but it sure looked at me like Jones was early both side number 61 defense fiveyard penalty first down that's not number 61 that's a long snap or they may be 51 fact room yeah I think could have got back roll or Jones on that fall against my first ham so you don't make a murder and on first down a gain of a little more than three by Freeman kleavon the 103rd pick in the 2014 draft had just a big breakout season his second year fines Taylor Gabriel and that's the first hand up to the 45 that is to blow blow an assignment there in the middle that opens up that Lane then for the easy completion down the progression list he found sinewed their short game but again nonetheless they're going into a hurryup offense at the line I got the Packers defensively reeling a little bit that Ryan he's making the calls at the line of scrimmage inside the 35 25 yard line for Tehran you see in the whole Blake Martinez he comes up and he's got a chance but that's an awfully good move in order to make him miss and then he finds a crease and he's off and running so so another big run for the Atlanta sausage first down cherry begin Atlanta without Tevin Coleman part of the dynamic duo and Atlanta they've been doing this all year long big plays that's why they're so explosive offensively and they're doing it without Tevin Coleman now Shanahan says he's the fastest running back that he's ever been around just a really explosive guy and Devonta Freeman he's no slouch either they've got a great onetwo punch but the big place is why the Falcons and scoring often and that's the first down to the 15yard line you look at these two backs when they have Freeman and Coleman coming through the first seven games of the year they have combined for over 1200 yards and nine touchdowns some good movement along that offensive line bring it through yard still in hurry up mode and now Matt Ryan says it looked like he was going to ask him to huddle up yep WB the tenth play of the drive 65 good job of mixing it up and even at the line of scrimmage at the model we're still getting runs called so man Ryan has done a good job on this possession of keeping things bounce mixing it up and machers has been on the hill jonesing motion is not caught a pass it's the opening quarter of this game but they're doing it with a run in large part on this drive but you got to believe it swirling down coming up here third and close to six 36 manageable third down in the red zone and man this is a down that the Packers have won the Falcons have not yet converted on 3rd down today it's a food again that's done turn locked up in the top you scream with Julio Jones three we descending for a touchdown he is tonight well that is quite a collision down there with Kentrell Bryce but Brian Deese comes over and the fact he's able to make a stop is really impressive right at the goal line it they're worried about Gabriel in the end zone and because they're playing soft on the outside it allows them then to get the ball to ward underneath but how about that stop at the goal line it frees that about three yards before that collision you think that's going to go to the runner and yep that's a good stop it's 1012 Bryce 24:19 and the Falcons spend a timeout UFC's legendary New York debut begins on fs1 the biggest prelims card in UFC history you have seen 205 prelims live from the garden November 12th only on fs1 the previous play with Taylor Gabriel that he's running into the corner of the endzone and they play soft so that's then we deceive Demetri Goodson who was was underneath that throw and it looked like when Ryan came underneath the ward that it would go for the touchdown but it's an excellent job by Kentrell price you'll see now with first and goal I would imagine they're going to hand the ball off and see they can't get some movement along that offensive line when they have an extra offensive lineman Tom Compton and out of the I formation the fullback Patrick DeMarco second ago we're talking why in the first one there back from being suspended the first four games of the year die on all those big bodies in the middle yeah Pannell he's the one who was able to get enough of a push to disrupt that not give Freeman anywhere to go with the football these are big physical guys inside are hard to move play action here would be a good place time since the pack gave up the rushing touchdown slide again and again it spinel Clinton dicks coming in along and Ryan and Julius Peppers third and goal look like it's designed to try to go outside but the tide in Palolo he gets pushed back and then Freeman has to try to get back inside of that block and there's just nothing there that's an excellent job it's Mike Pannell once again who just stands his man up and gives no movement Dom Capers his defense playing goal line defense doing a good job on first and second their dad you throw it here well I would have gone play action on second down but I think from here what's happened on the first two plays I would come out throwing but I like second down play acts and they decide to run a cut stop Freddie that's where they give it to Coleman he's a touchdown leader with five of them pulling out him today they stick with Freeman three straight carries and finally get in I think it's good patience by the runner and as you're going to see the blocking that they are able to get this time they use the Eagles they block down with the right tackle Schrader they kick out with Levite tree pullin and it opens up a crease that's all it still clicked all right there inside the two we got a game in Atlanta what a drive when a drive when a drive 14 plays 80 yards chewing up seven minutes and 31 seconds now Freeman gets a credit for the touchdown Wood had a lot to say to get him down now consent 43 rushing yards in the entire first half on that drive alone they ran for 45 everyone Aaron told everybody to relax attack or offensive be alright days gave a sponsored by Pizza Hut no.1 a Pizza Hut playing their final season on these Falcons in the Georgia Dome brand new digs next year in fact that both the Falcons and their baseball brethren the Atlanta Braves moving into brandnew venue this next year all right Atlanta fine 26:24 Rogers of the Packers answer they isolate Adams and that'll be a gain of eight let's go downstairs to Erin Andrews Tom ESPN is reporting that time Montgomery is out today due to a kidney ailment now sources are saying he observed blood in his urine after getting a hit in the Bears game on Thursday night sources are also saying taking him out of the game today was precautionary reasons did follow up with Green Bay PR about it may said they're not going to address anything today during the game Erin thank you so much we will second down this young fella I mean this guy was a complete afterthought in this Green Bay offense four weeks ago in fact he did not play a single down on offense when they lost the game against Minnesota but then the injury start to pile up and then last week he has ten receptions over 60 yards 10 rushes over 60 yards in fact he's got 20 passes over the last two games well that's it he kind of found his role 10 catches 98 yards against Cowboys two weeks ago and that was really when he first kind of had his breakout game and haven't really been able to get him on the field much as a receiver they found his niche as a running back because of the injuries and he'd really excelled and our thoughts are with him we hope he's okay put it down did he get the ball there or that might be a heck of a chance I couldn't tell if Davante Adams got his hands underneath that one or not but it was low and that's a hard catch to make one enchants an excellent catch this guy has really come on is as we talked about and they need him they need him today and even he certainly delivered there that's a nice play on his part nine catches 64 yards they handed off to Jackson he was a stiff on right in the mouth Padilla jumped Beasley appears to be shaken up over on the Atlanta side line you pick Beasley is slowly becoming one of those guys who came off the field there holding his wrist he's become one of those guys that I think is an offense you got to concern yourself with when you go in on Wednesday and the game plans being put in the first thing you do is look at who the pass rushers are and how you're going to block them up and he's become one of those guys that gets the attention an offensive coordinator he was injured almost all of last year playing with a bad shoulder and he didn't tell anybody about it it took a lot of heat for being a first round now standing open field tackle made by Bryant pool go down coming up and we send it to LA to Curt Menefee well Philip Rivers has thrown three interceptions today against Denver is also throwing two touchdowns this from the Travis Benjamin captain 98 yard drive great catch by bedlam for the 14 yard score it's 1713 late the third Tom Ford a no Thomas 1313 here the last time it was third and long on the previous possession the Falcons decided to bring the black have shown a lot of it but third long you see what they decide to do here the Beasley back on the field and they just get the play off Raja's his second sack of the game for Adrian play boy this guy the last three weeks is really playing well for the Falcons that's with a threeman rush to Claiborne gets home backers of putt Americus came to the week on fox and Rogers of the Green Bay Packers go through the third quarter without a point after looking so impressive over the first half despite the fact that they have so many parts of their offense missing with injuries here today defense has really stepped up these last two series when he crosses the 30yard line playboy getting his second sack of the game and a big hug from his head coach they came on Fox is sponsored by Hyundai an official sponsor of the NFL and by Corona extra who invites you to find your Beach Atlanta with a football in a twopoint lead 12 seconds into this final quarter from the Georgia Dome in Atlanta on their most recent crime and they start off running the football here the one thing the Falcons have been able to do today is get off the field or at least here in the second half on on third down and they've got the pressure on Aaron Rodgers you see a great Claiborne he's one who made the sack on that last third down they have three sacks in this game they only had 19 sacks all of last year the fewest in the NFL this year counting the 3 today they have 18 so have almost matched last year sack total to get some pressure in this happened get off the field on third down you know 14 of those 18 incoming so now the packers Akron with a sack of their own the guy you brought up earlier Troy that you've liked this game for a number of years and that's Big Mike Daniels well he's a beast I mean he plays on the opposite side of the line of scrimmage most of the time pretty good coverage around the board but inside and ELA btree he gets pushed right back into Matt Ryan and it's because of Mike Daniels and you watch the tape on this guy and he said he's an animal and I know Dom Capers says he's the Tasmanian devil and there's not a real tall guy but he's got some real power and he just launches people inside he's good and passrush and he's good against the rock he makes a big play Rome alternate a year ago for the first time was Daniels goes flying again this time in the arms of the great Julius Peppers still going strong at 36 years young Julius Peppers inside and you're going to see the job that he does as he comes off of the block he sees Matt Ryan he's on outside and then as soon as Ryan tries to step up he comes off them it makes a veteran play they try to minimize his snaps a little bit like what Atlanta does with Dwight Freeney he makes a big play to force the punt knows he's got as frequently as we used to be career of Julius Peppers he is truly one of the game's alltime greats Davis all ready has a big return today get busy slam down now to finish that thought about Julius Peppers he we know what he's done the NFL six most sacks in the history of the game we're gonna return personal foul grabbing the facemask Dickey team 15yard penalty push down for a timeout at some big penalty on the Falcons attack on 15 the return and there's one they didn't pick up before we went to break wold Anderson said the penalty was on Atlanta it's on Kentrell Bryce in Green Bay that's the right call and it looked like when we went to commercial the Packers were going to have outstanding field position they corrected the mistake on the call and Kentrell price it definitely had a hold of the facemask and out backs him up so instead of having the ball on the 42 yard line which is where it would have been if you tacked on the penalty following the return the strive will start at the Green Bay 14 yard line now the fourth quarter in the last two weeks the Falcons had leads in Seattle they had a lead here at home last week against San Diego and let them get away nothing turned out to be losses yeah that's when you got to be good I'm in this game twopoint game right now and who's going to make the plays and he's not going to make the big mistakes by Brian Poole you know bull was brought in as a college free agent some may forget Dan Quinn he was in Seattle he went to the University of Florida to be the defensive coordinator for the Gators he recruited both Brian Poole and his daughter at safety well when you're an undrafted guy a lot of times in trying to make the team you look for the easy matchups in training camp and he jumped out and the coaches Minds because he was the one who offered to go against Julio Jones he want to play against the best they like mr. nasty now he's basically smarter as their nickel core ready second down babban the Atlanta defense and slides his way for a first hand well it just drives a defensive coach crazy drives these defensive players crazy that they was good coverage around the horn but when you've got the athletic ability of Aaron Rodgers and you know man coverage once again he sees that he knows what he has it all right you got him covered up and now you got to count for him he's had a couple nice runs in this game picking up first downs see 45 yards rushing for Rajas he just looks like he's gotten some of his swagger back in this game you watching him tell it in his face well there is very little doubt who they want to put the ball into the hands of here down to stretch and that is really their lone man standing you could say Nelson but he's not all the way back from the injury it's Davante Adams yeah they've moved him around a little bit too and he's absorbed it you know to be able as you look at the numbers that he has last week 132 yards receiving today 12 catches he's been a real focal point and when you could move a guy around like him and put him in the backfield have new things it talks about you know that him being a smart player and he can take on a lot of different roles 9:32 go here in the fourth quarter and Rajas just weaving in and out of traffic it looked like he should have been sacked and he picked up three take a look at kind of what Aaron Rodgers is seeing it in some of the coverage down the field they've got a free guy in the middle and he's the one who's got his eyes locked as they're in man coverage he's he's free and he's watching Rodgers now Rodgers makes a mess right there and he's able to get a few more yards but after he's hit scratch though and picked up some yardage when they went to the man they're they're gonna try to keep him in the pocket but he still picks up pretty good game ready by geronimo Alison there is a penalty flag about five yards beyond the line of scrimmage but generally is going against the defense it's a good throw by Rogers on that play the illegal hands hands to the face number 34 defense penalty is declined result of the flyest completed pass forced down this is cold on Josh Norman five times today against H ain't green hands to the face right off the line of scrimmage here's the end of that with a wellthrown ball right on the boundary and Geronimo Allison is able to tapdance his feet inbounds and get the completion we're players for each of these teams today on offense with all the injuries and keep people Oh to the 38yard line riff Kowski the he just ran right over Beasley we got a little help from his right guard TJ Lang who is having a heck of a season this year at right guard and Bukowski he's a load menu ed but 320 pounds with it have a hard time getting him on the ground he attacked is for green bait especially on the offensive side of the football for a minute Cobb Montgomery Starks we know Lacey's not here at all so you have guys today like Geronimo Allison his side of the active roster has a touchdown Trevor Davis rookie his first career catch his first career touchdown ripped Kowski out of the backfield in the job he's done and the same thing on Atlanta side 2 rogg Ward Austin Hooper been an interesting day for guys we've not heard much fraud so big ferry down Rogers main running the first day now Rogers is going to run this defense right out of man coverage I talked about it earlier it's not a defense it plays a lot of man they're primarily a zone coverage team and when they have gone man coverage they've not been able to contain Aaron Rodgers and he's been able to get outside has just been nobody there I talked about it earlier that sometimes the best days come when you least expect it number 12 to having a heck of a day TJ Lang first to the Packers he'll look at him and we'll be back today's team on Fox is sponsored by low TJ Lang has been bothering a been bothered with a hip injury this entire year it's a second week in a row he's had to leave a game Aaron Rodgers 60 yards rushing a careerhigh Rodgers came in with a total of 96 rushing yards for this entire year well repouss\u00e9 he's been able to have some success when he's around the ball he hadn't run it a lot but Falcons defensively they've tightened up on some of these runs from Don Jackson but yet they've not been able to control Aaron Rodgers and Don Barclay there comes in for TJ Lyon to the corner and tips away at the last second by CJ Goodwin good play by CJ Goodwin initially it looked like Rogers is going to be able to drive this ball in the hole to Davante Adams and he's able to undercut it get his hand just enough on that ball and knock it away that's a good play on his part he's a land of Falcons feel like they should have a six in one record coming into this game detail last two weeks they've had fourthquarter leads and could not nail it shut Leon a two point lead with 708 to go Rodgers in a Packers to stay tackle let's see they'll put it at the 18yard line so it'll be third down and four Tampa Bay lost earlier today with a chance to go to four and three that was a wild one an overtime loss to the Raiders New Orleans shocks Seattle at home so big game for Nelson may have run himself out of the first down what happened Jordy Nelson he gets the ball and he's in position if he plants that left foot and gets up the field north and south he picks up this first down he runs the quick quick drag route right there if he plants it and just heads up but Alford comes up he see that Dan quince trying to get a timeout called women will see whether or not they actually gave it to him but he was trying to get a timeout called before that ball was snap it looked like Alford was the one who came off and made the play on Nelson and kept him from picking up the first down boy Jordy Nelson's been around long enough now he's got to know better right there he's got it he gives it up as he tries to get out and around Alford and Alford makes a good open field tackle Green Bay is challenging the ruling on the field that the receiver was short of the line of game I thought maybe the officials were huddling to talk about whether or not timeout was called but it's either going to be a first down or for that short amounted Mike Ferrara like McCarthy has challenged this call and the ruling of a spot of the ball yeah you want you to get what you've got here is you've got contact by the defender and it certainly Jordi had the first down but he's gonna get the ball really where he's first contacted by the defender and watch him go now back the other side of the 14 I think the spot was a little bit short I think they could move it forward some but I still think he's short of the first down it's the point of contact when the defender first makes contact also taking a look here too at the number of players on the field which again even though they may have stopped it and the challenge was for something else they can review this too if in fact there were 12 even if that wasn't challenged they could review this but but I think they're gonna focus obviously on the spot now you look at Mike as he's watching or looking at his play call as to what he's going to decide to do if if they don't get the first down which I agree with Mike Pereira that hit right down here that might have been the guy they caught as the 12th man as we know Aaron Rodgers as good as anybody best in the league at getting guys getting defenses Cobb with 12 men but as he looks at that call sheet looks like he's thinking about going for it if it's fourth and short and I don't know I think you have to take the field goal and take the lead at this point in the game with it there's a lot going on here and you can understand why it's taken a while because if that 12th man who almost looked like he broke into shutdown mode getting to the sideline that's Brooks Reid he's not hustling off if he has one foot in the field to play before he had said sideline that's a 12 magus Troy you counted the other 11th the snap of the ball was a third down in five so if they have 12 men on the field this could be an automatic first now doesn't matter what Jordy Nelson did factor here in the play defensive player number 50 was attempting to get off the field was not off of the field when the ball was snapped that's defense 12 players five yard penalty and the five yards results in a first down Green Bay is not charged with a timeout that was the guy Brooks read you right Tom means just kind of casually jogging off the field and I don't know that that Roger saw him I mean maybe he did if he probably did knowing how many times he's done that but and that might have been why Dan Quinn was running over there who's on his sidelines running over there trying to get the timeout called knowing that Rogers had gotten under center while they were trying to substitute a couple of players there though on each side that they just got a no better for Jordy Nelson you got it know where the first down marker is and for Brooks Reid you got to know you're up against Aaron Rodgers and you got to get off the feet when I think Dan Quinn's talking to the officials saying hey I was calling for timeout prior to the ball being snapped so he's making the argument that he wanted a timeout somebody should have been paying attention to him as well so a lot happening on this play and a lot of a lot of people able to look at it and say they didn't get the proper call there he is right down here Dan Quinn prior to the ball being snapped was trying to get the call trying to get the clock stopped then you know what a lot like Brooks Reid he was walking and not sprint and how about that shot we had a baron rogers they're looking at the sidelines and watching glitch to get that bowls now you see it really about every game recall the defense tries to substitute Andrew hunters catches any with 12 men to the 7yard line maybe inside the seven maybe they found themselves a new runner he's run the ball well when he's gotten his opportunities he's been moving the pie you see right there that the 70 is backed into the gate to the package TJ laying back and right guard ready it's written down by Grady Jared Fleury down coming up inside the ten this ballgame here and to see whether or not assuming that if they don't make it the factors make the field goal what then the Falcons would need to do to retake the lead touchdown here by the Packers and the touchdown of their own 13th play of the drive showing up better than eight minutes and they're closing in on Florida Goa third and four and the back of the end zone by Janice but we wait on the penalty it comes in a secondary so where the flag is we'll see how they do it but I tell you that was that was one heck of a throw by Aaron Rodgers in the back of the endzone moving to his left I thought he's gonna try to cross him route under bowling number 37 defense that penalty is the kind it was open to play as a touchdown Tigers gonna go for two here Jordy Nelson is going to be on the backline you can see his Roger slides to his left and then having to lead him with the with a receiver running away he throws another dart the Jordy just beats his man excuse me Janice beats his man to the middle I got away with a hold there on on Upshaw but it's a heck of a throw by Aaron Rodgers fitting the ball into Janus on the backline moving away from the throw well they're gonna go 42 to try and make it a sixpoint spread we saw earlier today Cincinnati and Washington ended in a tie it would not have been tying at Mike Nugent the bengals field goal kicker made a point after touchdown i like the decision here it's the right decision to make ready go Aaron Rodgers four touchdown passes today and he's gonna run this one in a convert the twopoint conversion so many early this season have been asking about Rogers is he the same guy as the Packers offense the same group we hark it back to this or II l.a.x relax well Erin Andrews pointed out at halftime and we've seen the Packers three times already this year there haven't been a whole lot of smiling going on in regards to their offense now whether or not they win this game will certainly determine whether they're smiling or not after but they got to feel real good about this offense Beasley took the bite on ripp Kowski rogers runs it in celebrating the sixpoint lead small screens stadiumsized content watch live local Sunday games on your smartphone with NFL mobile Matt Bryan 24 comefrombehind wins and his outstanding career he has 32 gamewinning drives in the fourth quarter or overtime including the postseason in his career in his pocket today first down that's the hopin to do it that's a gain of eight to the hurryup but they've got plenty of time on the clock there's no need to really rush we're not working against the clock as much as they are just trying to execute properly the catch is made by Justin Hardy history's catch hey that's another first down two timeouts remaining along with a twominute warning litleo Jones Dillon at the reception since the first quarter of this game he clearly has been g\u00fcnther nearly jumped it and took it the other way he was reading through and he saw an opportunity and Matt Ryan fortunate that ladarius gun are not there returning that one the opposite direction for touchdown second out of town short of the first down by company guys so to bring up Lurie down into right at the 45yard line there is gunner he's up now but he was slow to get up it looked like maybe he had gotten banged up but he's grabbing at his left hamstring he's got fire safety to the 33yard line 231 to go understatement hurry up mode they had so much success on it their last Drive two drives ago when they went down the field where an injured player that is Gunther who you just pointed out Troy a moment ago they're looking at him this already beat up Green Bay secondary threesies here's Brooks Reed as he's coming off the field and that's the guy that God is the 12th man that helped keep this drive alive we don't know what they would have ruled on the fourth but on the third down play whether or not it was a first down for Jordy Nelson here's the touchdown to Jeff Janis on the back of the end zone just an outstanding throw by Aaron Rodgers the twopoint conversion Vic Beasley bites because they've been handing the ball to riff Kowski Aaron Rodgers keeps it nobody accounts form easy twopoint conversion a lot of times as an offense you go into a game and you know what your twopoint play is going to be I don't think that was what they had planned coming into this game it was based off of what they had been showing Atlanta with rutowski in the backfield seemed that Beasley and no one's accounted for the quarterback they pick up the two points straight for why 231 to go Falcons down six this is Mohammed city we don't know how he turned Julio Jones is the first a minute or two of the second quarter he caught a pass his third reception of the day's not caught a pass since the first half and we have reached the twominute warning can the Falcons win one in the fourth Daisy was sponsored by Verizon join the better network because better matters five lead changes nearly 700 yards of offense a two quarterback six touchdowns without an interception two minutes to go and Green Bay leading by six suck it down attacted by Joe Thomas when you're down by six year and four down territory anyway so it's a starting down coming up they've got the first down they were able to get get enough there to pick it up baby boy new set of downs but right now you're kind of balancing trying to get the ball into the end zone and get the touchdown that you need and also leaving a lot of time on the clock for Aaron Rodgers rock 20.25 thirsty Julio Jones and for the third straight week late in the game Jones is looking for a flag this look a good throw it was tight coverage then Clinton Dix was right there saw that ball pop up it looked like he had an opportunity to make an interception when the ball would hit him in the hands he's not able to make a play on it but I thought that was pretty good coverage there was a tight fit to try to squeeze that one in by that is the first time Jones has been targeted in this second man still doesn't have a catch in it Mohamed Sanu is going to go to guy on this live and he is run out of bounds at the 14 yard line third and one coming up and Moriah he hasn't thrown two main completions in this ballgame and as we shown they've not been able to get the ball to Julio Jones Packers have done a good job with him but Sanu has has you're right been the goto guy for Matt Ryan sinu eight receptions 73 yards 31 the Falcons have two timeouts left looks like it's enough for a first down and again it's Austin Hooper he's one of those guys we brought up earlier having the best game of his career looper five catches they almost made that one a little tougher than it needed to be Matt Ryan thought he was going to stay on the run Hooper started to pull up and they were still able to get the completion in the first down clock winding to 42 41 40 snap it again 37 Lily ran second fiddle to AJ green with the Bengals he runs second fiddle to Julio Jones in Atlanta but he was the man on this Drive well Sanu he he comes at Jake Ryan and he's been running those crossing routes so shallow routes and Jake Ryan kind of body's a mop like he's one to try to run a drag and then he takes up the middle of the field and Jake Ryan gets caught on his heels it makes for an easy throw then for Matt ride in the touchdown so huge extra point now for Matt bride he's missed four in his career but none since a movie and it is good Matt Ryan last two weeks heartbreak in the fourth pointer he delivers here may you see Jake Ryan there in the middle of linebacker NASA new comes in then he takes the middle and the Packers had been playing too deep safeties and they've been given help to the outside and that's why they haven't been able to get the ball to Julio Jones so where they vulnerable they're vulnerable down the middle they tried fitting it to Julio Jones down the middle they're unable to make that completion they run some knew in there they get Jake Ryan on his heels as a linebacker that's a missed mismatch there and they're able to take advantage of it in man Ryan who's had a tough couple weeks with some costly interceptions that have ultimately led to losses for these Falcons after winning four in a row he delivers here in the clutch but this one's not over there's 31 seconds left you have Aaron Rodgers who's had a spectacular game has two timeouts talked about of Mohamed Sanu who I really liked when we had an opportunity to cover the Cincinnati Bengals and I thought he was a great compliment as the inside guy to Aga Green there I think he's an outstanding compliment to Julio Jones for this Falcons offense and he had himself a day here in this one now it should be noted the OT presented by Lowe's coming up next and we have baseball Mason Crosby the field of liquor hackers as davison synchrony he is not attempt at a 50yard field goal this year but don't think he's not capable he is hit from 50 and beyond in every season of his NFL career 53 53 56 career long 58 he hit from 56 a year ago roger is looking for a divine intervention 31 seconds left to go and the Packers have two timeouts all they need is a field goal a lot of time timeout especially when Rogers is a quarterback what came here door man rush look out James I play took five seconds the falcons are going to try to play coverage they're going to play deep and not give up any big plays they're going to give up some of those shorter throws and if the packers can take advantage of those and get it out of bounds eventually they'll start working the middle with the timeouts to use for a 55 yard attempt you roughly have to get the ball down to the 37 yard line the one on one here some kind of hand signal to somebody there by Rogers he's looking way down appeal and it's incomplete now is Jordy Nelson and good coverage by the rookie Neal a good idea though the good ideas Jordy Nelson he's banged up coming out of that play they're able to get a shot at him just a ball that gets away from Aaron just enough but they're trying to work this in had oneonone to the left they work Jordy Nelson in behind that he's got positioned for a play ball just goes high Nelson got off the field wisely because if they have to tend to him they would have charged Green Bay with the timeout we talked about roughly the 36yard line in his career long is 58 that's four years ago we hit from 56 last year so you'd like to give them a little bit more wiggle room in out well they did end up taking away the timeout so the Packers in 20 seconds need to roughly go is Trevor Davis he's down here at the bottom of the screen 14 seconds remain that's good one who had a big play on the last ride looked initially like rogers was going to try to get his feet in the ground and had a chance to end that game where the plane but it looked like they were going to try and take a shot down the field but Rogers just unable to get his feet set that bone came over if he makes that play boy down and free to go javante Adams was he was opened down the field but had not turned around to look for the ball here's Jordy Nelson initially nothing there and then he comes outside the bhante Adams and Rogers you saw him signal to Adams after the play was incomplete that he just wanted him to give him something towards the boundary and it becomes streetball at this point fourth down you just hoping a guy who see what you're seeing and come off of coverage and and he doesn't but credit to Atlanta Falcons Matt Ryan takes him down the field after the Packers and taking a sixpoint lead he drives him down with a touchdown does an excellent job in the defense this young defensive we've talked about that Dan Quinn is slowly molding into what he wants and a fast flowing aggressive group they do their job against one of the league's best in Aaron Rodgers a big win for the Atlanta Falcons well the only bad mouth your defense when you give up 32 and you score 31 you give up 32 and score 33 everything's aokay back in a moment",

  "transcript": "to buy the new Nissan Titan back alongside the halloffamer Troy Aikman and Erin Andrews Thom Brenneman Titans at quarterback two of the best Packers and the Falcons talking about Aaron Rodgers and Matt Ryan and especially not to take anything away from Ryan but we talked about at the beginning of the game with so many weapons missing this has been an incredible first half of the Green Bay offense well I don't know what anyone was expecting but I certainly didn't expect that kind of performance from the Packers offense because of the injuries Aaron Rodgers found seven different receivers in that first half spreaded around got Jordy Nelson of all big plays down the field only handed the ball off to a running back on six plays and Aaron Rodgers who scrambled twice out rushed all of them combined so a heck of a first half by the quarterback who was a little uncertain as to what exactly was going to occur out here without so many of his weapons but that was a good half for him and it was a good half also for his counterpart Matt Ryan at Ryan two touchdown passes Rodgers three touchdowns reception out to the 25 comes Rodgers in the pack and we check in with Aaron and I have to be honest with all these injuries I haven't seen Green Bay happy in quite this time as they left the field Aaron Rodgers was pumped out Mike McCarthy was smiling he said it was very happy with the way they often spread out the field love the protection by the offensive line but said we have got to run the ball here in the second half Dan Quinn defensively told me with Aaron Rodgers feeling this good and looking this hot out there on the field he said we have got to get some turnovers alright Aaron thank you so much those are the numbers on Rodgers mention the three touchdowns the two runs in the big one they're the final drive of the half which led to that field goal and the San 2419 advantage well if you come into a half hoping for turnovers by the Packers it's a lot of wishful thinking on most afternoons they do as good a job as anybody year in and year out protecting the football Aaron Rodgers and just four interceptions on a season great protection again outstanding coverage by Robert Algernon Jordy Nelson Alfred is just a spectacular athlete for 340 as a vertical leap of better than 41 inches and talk about strong at the combine I mean for a guy that weighs 185 pounds he ripped off 17 reps of 225 pounds on the bench press I drafted those two corners back in 2013 they got output in the second round they drafted two font the first and these are two guys they believe are cornerstones for this defense and what Dan Quinn wants to do chaste Rogers and he dies forward after a pot take short of the first down depending on where they will spot it looks like the 33 so they'll be too short of the first down third down coming up Ciaran Rogers once again taken off running I said yeah runningbacks combined Mike McCarthy said that they have to run the ball will mark par that's Colin run cuz they only had six of them there in the first half are they going with Miles Davis Don Jackson based on Lacey and Starks to Devante atoms and that's enough for a first and good coverage there by the rookie pool but they didn't need much it was good coverage and it was good timing from Rodgers to Davante Adams I think this is one of the areas where Davante Adams has really grown as a receiver his route running has improved dramatically here in his third season and I thought last year watching him you know he was not a very disciplined route runner but most of it really had to do his struggles with just not being healthy I know you talk to anybody in the organization they're really pleased with him and Philly has improved but primarily because for the first time a long time he's healthy they had the concussion against Janice when he came back against Chicago and that's rip Kowski so they call the running play and the big fella who only has one two carries today that gives him a tall year that's a 12 yard gain ripped house key out of the University of Oklahoma and he I was speaking earlier about the fact they broke camp but they only had two running backs on their roster and that being Eddie Lacy and James Starks isn't they like what's happening over there with ripped aus key but he's a guy who as we saw whom he's capable he doesn't get many opportunities but he's capable of running the football a little bit like what John Coon was back grip Kowski beats gone out for the roster spot but who was that type of guy too very versatile and Alison opened at the 42yard line the rare myths on a passing attempt today by Rodney's second in 10 under pressure and when trying to shore up that outside pass rush and just not allow Rodgers to escape the pocket throughout the first half and now on that play also he's able to escape but it puts that defensive back in a really tough position to stay on there guys with all the zone coverage that they run they have protected lodgers very well been sacked one time getting rid of it quickly into the hands of atoms and know what a tackle right there that could have been a huge game Keanu Neil for a minute it looked like Davante Adams was going to break this tackle Jian O'Neill comes in and has to punch at the ball as he comes in to make the play it was able to get Davante Adams to grab so right now a big third down here for this Atlanta Falcons team they give the ball with not much time in the half and they give up three points in to keep from giving up points on this Drive there'll be a big play third and six try to get him on a lard camp yeah it was good job by Rogers a lot of times when you're on the road especially in the dome you can't use the hardcamp but we heard Rogers use it coming up tonight game five Cubs on the ropes trailing three games to one but they'll hand it to Johnny Lester Lester did not have a good start is only started this year's World Series but through his career he has been an outstanding postseason pitcher they need right 3d of the game on this third down and six trying to get to Rogers and they get to Rogers adri\u00e1n playboy the former number one pick of Tampa Bay he is healthy again and Dan Quinn says keep an eye on this guy that Quinn dials it up he brings the pressure and there's a crosser that comes in front of Rogers who's got it he's got a chance if he if Rodgers gets it out to him quickly but instead he hangs on to it and the pocket collapses you see Rodgers was expecting a hole to be called that's a great stop defensively by the Falcons by jacob Shabbos come under a lot of fire this is first season they can't find the ball there's a missed chance right there by Janus he should have been pinned inside the five Julio Jones they worked on him at halftime taking some hard falls awkward falls in the game so far today and we'll see what he has the big play ports down the field from Taylor Gabriel but this defense focused on Julio Jones coming in know that they've got to be able to control him within that passing game and they've done that he had three catches twenty nine yards there in that in that first half so Green Bay's got to be pleased with how they've been able to handle him now they they know what Gabriel's capable capable of doing with the speed that he has we still got to minimize these big plays like us to force it in there and broken up by Blake Martinez or wookie starting linebacker out of Stanford he's been a good addition to this defense I know I was talking to Mike Daniels down there on the on the field before the game and this run defense when Clay Matthews is playing to Nick Perry was having a great year and then the two big guys inside but he really feels that the difference in their defense this year against the run has been the contributions by Blake Martinez so it's high praise for the rookie linebacker into the hands of Muhammad Sydney got a block big time block still on his feet and he's up to the 26 yard line say Austin hooker is really having a nice game whether it's catching balls down the field or making a block that gave Sanu a little room right there he has played in every game this year but it's not been as featured as he is to do yeah Hooper one of those one of those young players that they're relying on Hey they're on my cahide but he's a he's a versatile guy he's primarily receiver but he's gotten better as a blocker black comes down ball is stripped away it looked like Daytona Jones who had that penalty earlier in the game knocked it out of the hands of Ryan it's recovered by Atlanta but I think we do have a flag and Jones may have started too soon it looked to me like he did and he they're gonna get together and talk about it but it sure looked at me like Jones was earlier both side number 61 defense fiveyard penalty forced down but it's not number 61 that's a long snapper I think maybe 51 fact rule yank that could have got back roll or dato Jones on that call now gives my first hand a little bit a third and five so you don't make a murder and on first down again a little more than three by Freeman Ravin the 103rd pick in the 2014 draft had just a big breakout season his second year my name's Taylor Gabriel and that's a first down up to the 45 that is the blown blow an assignment there in the middle that opens up that Lane then we're the easy completion well down the progression list he found sinewed their short game but again nonetheless now they're going into a hurryup offense at the line they got the Packers defensively reeling a little bit Matt Ryan he's making the calls at the line of scrimmage in the outside inside the 35 run down finally close to the 25yard line for Tehran boy you see in the whole Blake Martinez he comes up and he's got a chance but that's an awfully good move in order to make him miss and then he finds a crease and he's off and running so it said another big run for the Atlanta Falcons and I'll put it in the hands of Freeman on a first down carry again Atlanta without Tevin Coleman part of a dynamic duo and Atlanta they've been doing this all year long big plays well that's why they're so explosive offensively and they're doing it without Tevin Coleman no Kyle Shanahan says he's the fastest running back that he's ever been around just a really explosive guy in the bunt a frame and he's no slouch either they got a great onetwo punch but the big place is why the Falcons lead the league in scoring office and that's the first down to the 15yard line you look at these two backs when they have Freeman and Coleman coming through the first seven games of the year they have combined for over 1200 yards in nine touchdowns get some good movement along that offensive line war nearby at all Raven 3yard still and hurry up mode and now Matt Ryan says it looked like he was going to ask him to huddle up yep done the lose me the tenth play of the drive 65 yards better than four minutes it's been a good Drive they've got a good job of mixing it up and even at the line of scrimmage at the no huddle we're still getting runs called so man Ryan has done a good job on this possession of keeping things bounce mixing it up and Packers have been on her Hills jonesing motion is not caught a pass it's the opener corner of this game but they're doing it with a run in large part on this drive but you got to believe a throwing down coming up here third and close to six third and six manageable third down in the red zone and this is a down that the Packers have won the Falcons have not yet converted on third down today over there again it's Gunther locked up in the top here screen with Julio Jones lays it off to a wide open and trying to run through a defender for a touchdown he is tonight well that is quite a collision down there with Kentrell Bryce but Bryce siamese comes over and the fact he's able to make a stop is really impressive right at the goal line and they're worried about Gabriel in the end zone and because they're playing soft on the outside it allows them then to get the ball to ward underneath but how about that stop at the goal line if you freeze that about three yards before that collision you think that's going to go to the runner and yep that's a good stop it's controlled twice 24:19 and the Falcons spend a timeout UFC's legendary New York debut begins on fs1 the biggest prelims card in UFC history you have seen 205 prelims live from the garden November 12 only on fs1 the previous play with Taylor Gabriel that he's running into the corner of the endzone and they play sob so that's then we deceive Demetri Goodson who was was underneath that throw and it looked like when Brian came underneath the ward that it would go for the touchdown but it's an excellent job by Kentrell price you'll see now with first and goal I would imagine they're going to hand the ball off and see if they can't get some movement along that offensive line when they have an extra offensive lineman Tom Compton and out of the I formation the fullback Patrick DeMarco region they can't get in second goal with like Ryan the first one there Pannell back from being suspended the first four games of the year guy on all those big bodies in the middle yeah Pannell he's the one who was able to get enough of a push to disrupt that not give Freeman anywhere to go with the football these are big physical guys inside hard to move play action here would be a good play all time since the pack gave up the rushing touchdown tried again deny and again it spinel Clinton dicks coming in along with Ryan and Julius Peppers third and goal looks like it's designed to try to go outside but the tight end but low low he gets pushed back and then Freeman has to try to get back inside of that block and there's just nothing there that's an excellent job it's Mike Pannell once again it just stands his man up and gives no movement Dom Capers his defense playing goal line defense doing a good job on first and second third and you throw it here well I would have gone playaction on second down but I think from here what's happened on the first two plays that I would come out throwing but I like second down playaction they decided to run it gut stuff normally that's where they give it to Coleman eesof touchdown leader with five of them without him today they stick with Freeman three straight carries and finally get in I think it's good patience by the runner and as you're going to see the blocking that they are able to get this time they use the ankles they block down with the right tackle Schrader to the kickout with Lafitte tree pullin and it opens up a crease that's old school football right there three straight plays inside the two we got a game in Atlanta want to drive when a drive when a drive 14 plays 80 yards chewing up 7 minutes and 31 seconds now Freeman gets a credit for the touchdown Ward had a lot to say to get him down there Falcons have 43 rushing yards in the entire first half on that drive alone they ran for 45 everyone Aaron told everybody to relax attack or offensive be alright playing their final season all these Falcons in the Georgia Dome brand new digs next year in fact both the Falcons and their baseball brethren the Atlanta Braves moving into brand new venues next year all right Atlanta in front 26:24 kid Rogers of the Packers answer they isolate atoms and that'll be a gain of eight let's go downstairs to Erin Andrews Tom ESPN is reporting that time Montgomery is out today Duke to a kidney ailment now sources are saying he observed blood in his urine after getting a hit and the Bears game on Thursday night sources are also saying taking him out of the game today was precautionary reasons did follow up with Green Bay PR about it may said they're not going to address anything today during the game Erin thank you so much thoughts it all will be well second down this young fella I mean this guy was a complete afterthought in this Green Bay offense four weeks ago in fact he did not play a single down on offense when they lost the game against Minnesota but then the injury starts to pile up and then last week he has ten receptions over 60 yards ten rushes over 60 yards in fact he's got 20 passes over the last two games well that's it kind of found his role 10 catches 98 yards against Cowboys two weeks ago and that was really when he first kind of had his breakout game and haven't really been able to get him on the field much as a receiver they found his niche as a running back because of the injuries and he'd really excelled and our thoughts are with him we hope he's okay to throw down Rodgers did he get the ball there well that might be a heck of a catch I couldn't tell if the Vontae Adams got his hands underneath that one or not but it was low and that's a hard catch to make one and show us an excellent catch this guy has really come on is as we talked about and they need him they need him today and he's and he certainly delivered there that's a nice play on his part nine catches 64 yards they hand it off to Jackson when he throws a stiff on right in the mouth of Deon Jones Beasley appears to be shaken up over on the Atlantis online you pick Beasley is slowly becoming one of those guys he came off the field they're holding his wrist he's become one of those guys that I think is an offense you've got to concern yourself with when you go in on Wednesday and the game plans being put in the first thing you do is look at who the pass rushers are and how you're going to block them off and he's become one of those guys that gets the attention on offensive coordinator he was injured almost all of last year playing with a bad shoulder and he didn't tell anybody about it took a lot of heat for being the first round bust now standing open field tackle made by Bryant Poole low down coming up and we send it to LA to Curt Menefee Tom it's 1313 here the last time it was third and long on the previous possession the Falcons decided to bring the Blitz haven't shown third longed to see what they decide to do here the Beasley back on the field and they just get to play off lodges has dropped second Sakata game for Adrian playboy the sky the last three weeks is really playing well for the Falcons that's with a threeman rush and Claiborne gets home backers of putt and Lana with a football on a 2point lead 12 seconds into this final quarter from the Georgia Dome in Atlanta very well on their most recent drive and they start off running the football here the one thing the Falcons have been able to do today is get off the field or at least here in the second half on on third down and they've gotten the pressure on Aaron Rodgers you see Adrian Claiborne he's one who made the sack on that last third down they have three sacks in this game they only had 19 sacks all of last year the fused in the NFL this year counting the three today they have 18 so have almost matched last year sack : they've been able to get some pressure in this half and get off the field on third down you know 14 of those 18 of coming in last three and a half games and out of Packers Akron with a sack of their own the guy you brought up earlier Troy that you'd liked this game for a number of years and that's Big Mike Daniels well he's a big stuff and he plays on the opposite side of the line of scrimmage most of the time pretty good coverage around the board but inside and ELA btree he gets pushed right back into matt ryan and it's because of Mike Daniels and you watch the tape on this guy and he said he's an animal and I know Dom Capers says he's the Tasmanian Devil in there he's not a real tall guy but he's got some real power and he just launches people inside he's good and pass rush and he's good against the run he makes a big play dough ball and then a year ago for the first time was Daniel's out of the other city of Iowa put down in the wall and down goes Ryan again this time in the arms of the great Julius pepper is still going strong at 36 years young Julius Peppers inside and you're gonna see the job that he does as he comes off of the block he sees Matt Ryan he's on outside then as soon as Ryan tries to step up he comes off of it makes a veteran play they try to minimize his snaps a little bit like what Atlanta does with Dwight Freeney he makes a big play to force the punt knows he's got no other we don't call this name as frequently as we used to be when you look back on the career of Julius Peppers he is truly one of the game's alltime greats Davis all ready has a big return today flag down as he slammed down and we wait on a penalty little finish had thought about Julius Peppers he we know what he's done in the NFL six most sacks in the history of the game we're going to return personal foul grabbing the facemask kicking team 15yard penalty timeout that's a big penalty on the Falcons attack on 4:15 to the return and there's one they didn't pick up before we went to break wold Anderson said the penalty was on Atlanta it's on Kentrell Bryce in Green Bay that's the right call it looked like when we went to commercial the Packers were going to have outstanding field position they corrected the mistake on the call and Kent drove Bryce it definitely had ahold of the face mass and out backs them up so instead of having the ball on the 42 yard line which is where it would have been if you tacked on the penalty following the return this drive will start at the Green Bay 14 yard line now the fourth quarter in the last two weeks the Falcons had leads in Seattle yeah had a lead here at home last week against San Diego and let them get away those turned out to be losses yeah that's when you got to be good I mean this game a twopoint game it's anybody's game right now it's who's going to make the plays and he's not gonna make the big mistakes into the hands of and that is an outstanding job by Brian Poole you know Poole was brought in as a college free agent some may forget Dan Quinn he was in Seattle he went to the University of Florida to be the defensive coordinator for the Gators he recruited both Brian Poole and his starter at safety keanu Neal well when you're an undrafted guy a lot of times when trying to make the team you look for the easy matchups in training camp and he jumped out and the coaches Minds because he was the one who offered to go against Julio Jones he want to play against the best they like this tenacity he made the team and now he's basically a starter as their nickel for money suck it down Rogers main chase by Pavano and he will outrun the Atlanta defense and slides his way for a first hand well it just drives a defensive coach crazy drives these defensive players crazy that they was good coverage around the horn but when you've got the athletic ability of Aaron Rodgers and you know man coverage once again he sees that he knows when he has it all right you got him covered up but now you gotta count for him he's had a couple nice runs in this game picking up first down see 45 yards rushing for Rogers he just looks like he's gotten some of his swagger back in this game did you watch any television space there is very little doubt who they want to put the ball into the hands of here down the stretch and that is really their lone man standing you can say Nelson but he's not all the way back from the injury it's Davante Adams and they've moved him around a little bit too and and he's absorbed it you know to be able as you look at the numbers that he has last week 132 yards receiving today 12 catches he's been a real focal point and when you can move a guy around like him and put him in the backfield him do things it talks about you know that him being a smart player and he can take on a lot of different roles 10:32 go here in the fourth quarter and lodges just weaving in and out of traffic it looked like he should have been sacked and he picks up three take a look at kind of what Aaron Rodgers is seeing him in some of the coverage down the field they've got a free guy in the middle and he's the one who's got his eyes locked as they're in man coverage he's he's free and he's watching Rodgers now Rodgers makes him miss right there and he's able to get a few more yards but after he's his scrambled and picked up some yardage when they went to the man there they're gonna try to keep him in the pocket but he still picks up pretty good game sucking down today lofted geronimo Allison there is a penalty flag about five yards beyond the line of scrimmage but generally is going against the defense it's a good throw by Rogers on that play the illegal hands hands to the face number 34 defense penalty is declined result of the play is completed pass first down this was called on Josh Norman five times today against AJ green hands to the face right off the line of scrimmage well here's the end of that with a wellthrown ball right on the boundary and Geronimo Allison is able to tapdance his feet inbounds and get the completion they're players for each of these teams today on offense with all the injuries and keep people missing is a big summer from the Kapow to the 38 yard line riff Kowski the he just ran right over Beasley they got a little help from his right guard TJ Lang who is having a heck of a season this year at right guard and gripped aus keys he's a load menu ad but 320 pounds with it now a hard time getting him on the ground they give it to a big man again and he's spun down three yards short of the first down so you look at all the the enactus for Green Bay and especially on the offensive side of the football for a minute Cobb Montgomery Starks we know Lacey's not here at all so you have guys today like Geronimo Allison his side of the active roster has a touchdown Trevor Davis rookie his first career catch his first career touchdown ripped Kowski out of the backfield in the job he's done then the same thing on Atlantis on tour on Ward Boston Hooper been an interesting day we're guys we've not heard much from it's a big fire down Rogers main running he will and it's a first down Raja's is going to run this defense right out of man coverage I talked about it earlier it's not a defense it plays a lot of man they're primarily a zone coverage team and when they have gone man coverage they've not been able to contain Aaron Rodgers and he's been able to get outside there's just been nobody there I talked about it earlier that sometimes the best days come when you least expect it number 12 to having a heck of a day TJ Langford for the Packers he'll look at him and we'll be back TJ lange has been bothering a bothered with a hip injury this entire year it's the second week in a row he's had to leave a game Aaron Rodgers 60 yards rushing a career high Rodgers team ended a total of 96 rushing yards for this entire year well rip Kowski has been able to have some success when he's around the ball he hadn't run it a lot but Falcons defensively they've tightened up on some of these runs from Don Jackson it but yet they've not been able to control Aaron Rodgers and Don Barclay their comes in for TJ Lang and right guard to the corner tipped away at the last second by CJ Goodwin good play by CJ Goodwin initially it looked like Rogers is going to be able to drive this ball in the hole to Davante Adams and he's able to undercut it get his hand just enough on that ball and knock it away that's a good play on his partner these Atlanta Falcons feel like they should have a six in one record coming into this game each of the last two weeks they've had fourthquarter leads and could not nail it shut Leon a two point lead with 708 to go Rodgers and the Packers knocking on the door catches made by Janice short of the first down tackle let's see they'll put it at the 18 yard line so it'll be third down and four Tampa Bay lost earlier today but a chance to go to four and three that was a wild one an overtime loss to the Raiders New Orleans shots Seattle at home some big game for Atlanta crossing pattern and Nelson may have run himself out of a first down that's exactly what happened Jordy Nelson he gets the ball and he's in position if he plants that left foot and gets up the field North and South he picks up this first down he runs the quick quick drag route right there if he plants it and just heads up but Alford comes up he see that Dan quince trying to get a timeout called we'll see whether or not they actually gave it to him but he was trying to get a timeout called before that ball was snapped it looked like Alford was the one who came off and made the play on Nelson and kept him from picking up the first down boy Jordy Nelson's been around long enough now he's got to know better right there he's got it and then he gives it up as he tries to get out in a round Alford and Alford makes a good open field tackle Green Bay is challenging the ruling on the field that's a receiver was short of the line of game I thought maybe the officials were huddling to talk about whether or not a timeout was called but it's either going to be a first down or fourth up short I'm out in my Carrera like McCarthy is challenged just call in the ruling of a spot of the ball yeah you want you to get what you've got here is you've got contact by the defender and it's certainly Jordi had the first down but he's gonna get the ball really where he's first contacted by the defender and watch him go now back the other side of the 14 I think the spot was a little bit short I think they could move it forward some but I still think he's short of the first down it's the point of contact when the defender first makes contact also taking a look here too at the number of players on the field which again even though they may have stopped it and the challenge was for something else they can review this too if in fact there were 12 even if that wasn't challenged they could review this but but I think they're gonna focus obviously on the spot now you look at Mike as he's watching or looking at his play call as to what he's going to decide to do if if they don't get the first down which I agree with Mike Brera that him right down here that might have been the guy they caught as the 12th man as we know Aaron Rodgers as good as anybody best in the league at getting guys getting defenses con with 12 men but as he looks at that call sheet looks like he's thinking about going for it if if it's fourth and short and I don't know I think you have to take the field goal and take the lead at this point in the game with it there's a lot going on here and you can understand why it's taken a while because if that 12th man who almost looked like he broke into shutdown mode getting to the sideline that's Brooks Reid he's not hustling off if he has one foot in the field of play before he had said sidelines that's a 12 Angus Troy you counted the other 11 the snap of the ball was a third down in five so if they have 12 men on the field there's gonna be an automatic first down doesn't matter what Jordy Nelson did after hearing the play defensive player number 50 was attempting to get off the field was not off of the field when the ball was snapped that's defense 12 players penalty and the five yards result in a first down Green Bay is not charged with a timeout that was the guy Brooks Reid you're right Tom I mean he's just kind of casually jogging off the field and I don't know that that Rodgers saw him I mean maybe he did if he probably did knowing how many times he's done that but and that might have been why Dan Quinn was running over there who was on his side lines running over there trying to get the timeout called knowing that Rodgers had gotten under center while they were trying to substitute a couple of players there though on each side that they just got to know better for Jordy Nelson you got to know where the first down marker is and for Brooks Reid you got to know you're up against Aaron Rodgers and you got to get off the field I think Dan Quinn's talking to the officials saying hey I was calling for timeout prior to the ball being snapped so he's making the argument that he wanted a timeout somebody should have been paying attention to him as well so a lot happening on this play and a lot of a lot of people able to look at it and say they didn't get the proper call there he is right down here Dan Quinn prior to the ball being snapped was trying to get the call trying to get clock stopped no but you know what a lot like Brooks read he was walking and not sprint and how about that shot we had of Aaron Rodgers they're looking at the sidelines and watching Brooks read go off the field to get that ball snapped you see it really about every game we call the defense tries to substitute in Rodgers taxes a with 12 men right so an automatic first down after the Pentagon rathaus key flowers easily to the 7yard line may be inside the seventh maybe they found themselves a new runner he's run the ball well when he's gotten his opportunities and he's been moving the pile you see right there number 70 is backed into the game to the package TJ lang back in white guard ready with Cosby is ripped down by Grady charity flurry down coming up inside the ten it's a big third down in this ball game here to see whether or not assuming that if they don't make it the Packers make the field goal what bent the Falcons would need to do to retake the lead and touchdown here by the Packers and it will force Atlanta to come back from the touchdown of their own 13th play of the drive chewing up better than eight minutes and they're closing in on Florida goa 34 the touchdown catch and the back of the endzone by Janice but we wait on the penalty it comes in a secondary sure where the flag is we'll see how they do it but I tell you that was that was one heck of a throw by Aaron Rodgers in the back of the endzone moving to his left I thought he's going to try to hit across and we're out underneath number 37 defense that penalty is the crime it was open the play as a touchdown Tigers good to go for two here Jordy Nelson is going to be on the backline you can see his Rodgers slides to his left and then having to lead him with the with a receiver running away he throws another dart the Jordy just beats his man excuse me Janus meets his man to the middle I gotten away with a hold there on on Upshaw but it's a heck of a throw by Aaron Rodgers fitting the ball into Janus on the backline moving away from the throw where they're going to go for to to try and make it a sixpoint spread we saw earlier today Cincinnati and Washington ended in a tie it would not have been at I had Mike Nugent the Bengals field goal kicker made a point after touchdown I like the decision here it's the right decision to make here in Rogers four touchdown passes today and he's going to run this one in to convert the twopoint conversion so many early this season have been asking about lodgers is he the same guy as a Packers offense the same group we harken back to this or e.l a back relax well Erin Andrews pointed out at halftime and we've seen the Packers three times already this year there haven't been a whole lot of smiling going on in regards to their offense now whether or not they witness good game will you know certainly determine whether they're smiling or not after it but they got to feel real good about this offense Beasley took the bite on ripp Kowski rogers runs it in celebrate the sixpoint lead Matt Ryan 24 comefrombehind wins it is outstanding career he has 32 gamewinning drives in the fourth quarter or overtime including the postseason in his career does he have another one in his pocket today first down that's Mohamed Sanu and that's a gain to me see Matt Ryan going into the hurry up but you know they've got plenty of time on the clock there's no need to they're not working against the clock as much as they are just time to execute properly guns it over the middle the catch is made by Justin Hardy his first catch and that's another first down two timeouts remaining along with a twominute warning Julio Jones still without a reception since the first quarter of this game he clearly has been plunging g\u00fcnther nearly jumped it and took it the other way he was reading through and he saw an opportunity and Matt Ryan fortunate that ladarius gone are not there returning that when the opposite direction for touchdown suck it downtown it was straight to flaming short of the first down by a couple of yards so to bring a third down in to right at the 45 yard line Darius Gunnar he's up now but he was slow to get up it looked like maybe he had gotten banged up but he's grabbing at his left hamstring he's got help over the top fire safety see stavi feet high to the 33yard line 231 to go understated Maria movie had so much success on it their last drive two drives ago when they went down the field when I'm an injured player that is Gunter who you just pointed out Troy a moment ago they're looking at him this already beat up Green Bay secondary there's Brooks Reese's here's Brooks Rita's he's coming off the field and that's the guy that God is the 12th man that helped keep this drive alive we don't know what they would have ruled on the 4th or on the third down play whether or not it was a first down for Jordy Nelson here's the touchdown to Jeff Janis on the back of the end zone just an outstanding throw by Aaron Rodgers the twopoint conversion Vic Beasley bites because they've been handing the ball to riff Kowski Aaron Rodgers keeps it nobody accounts form easy twopoint conversion a lot of times as an offense you go into a game and you know what your twopoint play is going to be I don't think that was what they had planned coming into this game and it was based off of what they had been showing Atlanta with ripped aus key in the backfield seemed that Beasley and no one's accounted to the quarterback they pick up the two points it's great for by 231 to go Falcons down six and this is Mohamed Sanu don't know how injured Julio Jones is the first minute or two of the second quarter he caught a pass his third reception of the day he's not caught a pass since the first half and we have reached a twominute warning can the Falcons win one in the board five lead changes nearly seven hundred yards of offense at two quarterbacks six touchdowns without an interception two minutes to go then Green Bay leading by six suck it down for me is wrapped up and tackled by Joe Thomas well when you're down by six year and four down territory anyway so it's a story down coming up they've got the first down they were able to get get enough there to pick it up baby boy you have a new set of downs but right now you're kind of balancing trying to get the ball into the end zone and get the touchdown that you need and also not believing a lot of time on the clock for Aaron Rodgers clock running 125 first and hands of Julio Jones and for the third straight week late in the game Jones is looking for a flag this look a good throw it was tight coverage then Clinton Dix was right there I saw that ball pop up it looked like he had an opportunity to make an interception from the ball and hit him in the hands he's not able to make a play on it but I thought that was pretty good coverage there was a tight fit to try to squeeze that one in by Matt Ryan that is the first time Jones has been targeted in this second half still doesn't have a catch in it Mohamed Sanu is going to go to guy on his drive and he is right out of bounds at the 14 yard line third and one coming up Moriah he hasn't thrown too many incompletions in this ballgame and as we shown they've not been able to get the ball to Julio Jones backers have done a good job with him but Sinuhe has has you're right been the goto guy for Matt Ryan so new eighth reception 73 yards 31 the Falcons have two timeouts left looks like it's enough for a first down and again it's Austin Hooper he's one of those guys we brought up earlier having the best game of his career move for five catches they almost made that one a little tougher than it needed to be Matt Ryan thought he was going to stay on the run Hooper started to pull up and they were still able to get the completion in the first down clock winding to 42 41 snap at a ball at 37 well here at second fiddle to AJ green with the Bengals he runs second fiddle to Julio Jones in Atlanta but he was the man on this Drive Wilson knew he he comes at Jake Ryan and he's been running those crossing routes those shallow routes and Jake Ryan kind of body's a mop like he's going to try to run a drag and then he takes up the middle of the field and Jake Ryan gets caught on his heels it makes for an easy throw then for Matt ride in the touchdown so huge extra point now from that bride he's missed four in his career but none since a movement back and it is gay Matt Ryan last two weeks light break in the fourth quarter he delivers here you see Jake Ryan there in the middle linebacker NASA new comes in then he takes the middle and the Packers had been playing too deep safeties and they've been given help to the outside and that's why they haven't been able to get the ball to Julio Jones so where are they vulnerable they're vulnerable down the middle they tried fitting it to Julio Jones down the middle they're unable to make that completion they run Sanu in there they get Jake Ryan on his heels as a linebacker that's a missed mismatch there and they're able to take advantage of it and man Ryan who's had a tough couple weeks with some costly interceptions that have ultimately led to losses for these Falcons after winning four in a row he delivers here in the clutch but this one's not over there's 31 seconds left you have Aaron Rodgers who's had a spectacular game has two timeouts talked about it Mohamed Sanu who I really liked when we had an opportunity to cover the Cincinnati Bengals and I thought he was a great compliment as the inside guy to AJ Green there I think he's an outstanding compliment to Julio Jones for this Falcons offense and he had himself a day here in this one now it should be noted the OU team presented by Lowe's coming up next and we have baseball Mason closby the field goal kicker for the Green Bay Packers as Davis will take a knee he is not attempt at a 50yard field goal this year but don't think he's not capable he is hit from 50 NBI every season of his NFL career 5350 356 careerlong 58 he hit from 56 a year ago Rogers looking for divine intervention with 31 seconds left to go and the Packers have two timeouts all they eat is a field goal it's a lot of time with two timeouts especially when Rogers is a quarterback what a game here to laugh fourman rush quick out to Janice the play took five seconds the falcons are going to try to play coverage they're going to play deep and not give up any big plays they're going to give up some of those shorter throws and if the packers can take advantage of those and get it out of bounds eventually they'll start working the middle with the timeouts to use for a 55 yard attempt you roughly have to get the ball down to the 37 yard line some kind of hand signal to somebody there by Rogers he's looking way down to feel and it's incomplete I was Jordy Nelson and good coverage by the rookie Neal it's a good idea though he's a good ideas Jordy Nelson he's banged up coming out of that play they're able to get a shot at him just the ball that gets away from Aaron just enough but they're trying to work this in and one on one to the left they work Jordy Nelson in behind that he's got positioned for a play ball just goes high the Nelson got off the field wisely because if they have to tend to him they would have charged Green Bay with the timeout we talked about roughly the the 36yard line is careerlong is 58 that's four years ago we hit from 56 last year so you'd like to give them a little bit more wiggle room and they did end up taking away the timeout so the Packers in 20 seconds need to roughly go the one guy that could run his Trevor Davis he's down here at the bottom on a string eighteen seconds remain that's good will to win a big play on the last Drive looked initially like Rogers was going to try to get his feet in the ground and had a chance to end that game where the play but it looked like they were going to try to take a shot down the field but Rogers just unable to get his feet set that ball came over if he makes that play for town and three to go one timeout left that's it javante Adams was he was open down the field but had not turned around to look to the ball here's Jordy Nelson initially nothing there and then he comes outside Davante Adams and Rogers you saw him signal to Adams after the play was incomplete that he just wanted him to give him something towards the boundary and it becomes streetball at this point fourth down you've just hoping a guy who see what you're seeing and come off of coverage and and he doesn't but credit the Atlanta Falcons Matt Ryan takes him down the field after the Packers had taken a sixpoint lead he drives him down with a touchdown does an excellent job in the defense his young defense that we've talked about that Dan Quinn is slowly molding into what he wants in a fast flowing aggressive group they do their job against one of the league's best in Aaron Rodgers the big win for the Atlanta Falcons the only bad mouth to defense when you give up 32 and you score 31 to give up 32 it's 4:33 everything's aokay back in a moment",

  "transcript": "let's go already kick it off Green Bay Packers won the toss they defer the Falcons we'll start with a ball but before we see any of that down to the sidelines the Green Bay side and Erin Andrews broken ribs check out this video from great game warmups he looks fine running around moving around seems like nothing's wrong with him I did with offensive coordinator after Bennett who told me they're interested to see how jeordy today unnecessary hit but Julie Nelson is a fool going let's end it over chrismyers for me the Falcons have their own term for it they call a tow gate they're gamechanging receiver Hollyoaks but in pregame warmup he gave the thumbs up he's outstanding his offensive coordinator said he's good to go Kyle Shanahan said I know I might lose him in the course of the game for recovery time but he knows his body's like NASA for him all systems have to be intact so at least to start the game number 11 for the Falcons is ready to take off and Joe it's so loud out here it can hardly hear yourself think Chris thanks thanks Aaron spanishlanguage broadcast available on both Fox deportation by utilizing sa P on our broadcast here we go Williams will bring it out it's popped at the 20 Kentrell Bryce you got a lot of action defensively last week when Morgan Burnett was lost in on the stop a 23 yard return in the last five games have all been wins for the Atlanta Falcons and number two is the big reason why well you look at his last five games 14 touchdowns no interceptions and I think that's been one of the big things in Matt Ryan's season this year really for the entire offense is the way they've been able to protect the football all year long well price who was in on the stop and who as I said got a lot of work last week when Morgan Burnett went down with a thigh injury was injured and he was in on that hard tackle of Wiens and here it is that's significant depending on what his status is Joe because like you said the fact he had to come in last week for Morgan Burnett when he left a game Morgan Burnett is active today but how how was he feeling what's his health like if he's unable to finish the ballgame then obviously Kentrell price would be the guy who comes in off the bench as he did last week so Ryan has to wait to get this thing started meanwhile the Packers get Quentin Rollins back an extra defensive back who suffered a concussion at Detroit week 17 he's missed the last two games so they have one extra body back there and we'll see if they had lost Bryce or if he's able to continue as this game goes on there's Burnett he's the quarterback of that back line of defense for Dom Capers and as you said in our open Dom's got his hands full here today trying to defend the toughest team to defense in the NFL well the injuries at this Green Bay Packers team has suffered throughout this season is really incredible in here they open up the opening kickoff the NFC Championship game and they lose control Bryce tossed a Freeman running right and big Mike Daniels in on the stop a gain of four this is a balanced team and they are explosive both with the run and with the pass and on the scoreboard as they rank first in points per game during the course of the regular season and over the last five that winning streak they've averaged scoring 38 beats a lot of different ways they can do it running the football and good on the bone it doesn't all go through Julio Jones they've got a lot of weapons format rhymes second and six passes caught by Austin hooker in the wookie time we missed a couple of games late in the season final two with an MCL sprain and a nice game against Seattle he's got eight yards here and a quick first down as you look at the Packers defense the takeaways they've started to pile up as the Packers in one eight straight right back to the line Ryan drops back has a man wide open and a drop from Gabriel and the young receiver was absolutely wide open plain Matthews with pressure on Matt Ryan but that is a drop these are the plays obviously you gotta be able to make Taylor Gabriel who really came on perfectly thrown ball by Matt Ryan he came on the last time these two teams met back in late October and he has been a nice addition he is a big play threat whenever they go in his direction just five eight little body Brian hangs in Jones and he's brought down by Jake Ryan a gain of four to bring up the first third down in the afternoon well we're going to be talking about this down a lot throughout this game because as we said coming in when you're expecting a highscoring game these downs like this become critical they get behind the chains because of the drop with Gabriel now they're facing their first third down which defense is going to win on this down in this ball game third down and six Flitz coming from Green Bay Pass is caught by Jones depends on the spot g\u00fcnther and coverage and Jones was brought down right at the stick and it's a first down play Matthews he rushes right over the center he's able to get past him put some pressure on Matt Ryan before he's able to get the ball out and Julio Jones he's able to go down and make the play and convert keep this drive alive Matt Ryan now 31 for 36 over the last four plus games on third down first down to Coleman and Tevin Coleman is got ten Morgan Burnett on the tackle in the second year bro from Indiana gets the fresh set of downs you see Chris Chester the right guard is that hole opens up he combo blocks he comes off he gets the linebacker Jake Ryan and a nice hole then for Tevin Coleman right up the gut so that graduates seven straight games of Falcons have scored an opening drive touch day mr. Coleman and he's brought down immediately by Nick Terry who's complained great now a little pushing and shoving after the play a loss of one on that carry by Coleman Gunther was involved as he defends sanu emotions running high in an important ballgame but right now Dom Capers he's trying to figure it out he'd like to be able to play the run and keep us safeties deep in coverage the Falcons have been able to run the football he's having to drop the safety down it's going to get oneonone looks on the outside with some big play potential Brian looked left all the way Jones can't make the play haha couldn't Dick's deliver the hit throw a little high for Julio Jones well even though they're playing the run they're going to keep ha Clinton Dix over to the side that Julio Jones is on so you see Dix does not get to the middle of the field he's able to then come back and make a play on Julio Jones and ha ha Clinton Dix really had an outstanding season this year Pro Bowl player and and came into his own and as many problems as his secondary has had ha ha when Dixon Morgan Burnett have really been the stabilizing guys back there now third and 11 Ryan hangs in the pocket passes caught first down soon they see the route by Mohamed Sanu and what a pickup he was by Thomas Dimitrov for this offense and a veteran guy had some good years there with the Cincinnati Bengals and he's able as a veteran player to work the inside the middle of the field and you have to have that when you've got a guy on the outside like Julio Jones who's going to attract so much attention he knows how to play second fiddle did that for AJ Green in Cincinnati now he does it for George four first downs for the Falcons left alone the fullback Marco and DeMarco sets up call to go from the five all the weapons on display for Matt Ryan the Falcons they motion gabriel around and as a result the packers they completely vacate the zone they get caught up in the receivers down the field you see DeMarco he's out in the flat all by himself seasonlong 31yard catching on by Patrick DeMarco what a drive handoff to Coleman fall into the three peppers on the stuff this offense is orchestrated by coordinator Kyle Shanahan who it seems like he is headed to the San Francisco 49ers is their next head coach but right now his plates full trying to figure out how to get Atlanta for their second Super Bowl there's Kyle 37 year old offensive coordinator he and Matt Ryan finally clicking here this season and on to Coleman Coleman is stood up well played by Green Bay Julius Peppers in the middle of a big pile of players no game well those guys in the middle of that Packers defense they're hard to move out Kenny Clark in the middle of that so now as good as this drive has been for the Atlanta Falcons to be able to move the ball down the field here on this opening possession big down right here for this Packers defense and are they able to keep him out of the end zone red zone possessions huge in this ball game third down and goal Ryan flush down touchdown sooner but a flag is down at the two Atlanta believes it's on Green Bay we'll get the call to make sure it's another opening drive touchdown for the Atlanta Falcons their 8th straight game and that's the penalty the touchdown will stand well Matt Ryan who's really not much with scramblers he starts out unnecessary roughness defense number 21 the Green Bay Packers are in some coverage and as you're going to see Matt Ryan when he gets flushed up into the pocket he's going to look to his left Micah high count is following his eyes and Sanu comes underneath and makes a nice catch on that one to score the touchdown three third down conversions on that opening possession including flip the salute for the touchdown makes it seven nothing dan Quinn in his second year with the Falcons has his team up seven early taking on Green Bay a great start even had a drop mixed into that opening possession he starts 6 4 8 64 yards in a two yard flip to Sanu so the thing he learned from the last NFC Championship game he played in that he doesn't have to do or that he had done all season long and that was a nice start it's the final football game to be played in this the 25th year in the history of the Georgia Dome the fans like to start their falcons up 7 well now Aaron Rodgers has his chance to try and answer Matt Ryan the numbers are insane for Aaron Rodgers this postseason just willed his team with a huge assist from Mason Crosby to will win last week over Dallas Nelson at the top of the screen Montgomery in the backfield and he gets it now takes it upfield and on the first play from scrimmage of four yard game for ty Montgomery before this drive started a moment between Aaron Rodgers and Bill vinovich all the pressure in the world on those two guys with their respective jobs and able to share a life he's playing with a lot of confidence as we know but to come in now this game started the way that we anticipated Atlanta gets the opening kickoff they take it 80 yards for a touchdown and now we'll see if Aaron Rodgers and company can match second and six time for Rogers there's Nelson welcome back Julian Nelson out of bounds inside the 45 broken ribs and all unbelievable well the Packers were expecting to start this game with man coverage from the Falcons and that's what they draw here on second down Jordy Nelson runs the corner route he shakes free an excellent job by him and then he takes the hit protects himself a little bit see how he holds up when he takes a fall right on those ribs and left side there but I'm impressed that he's even in this game playing just a few weeks removed from broken ribs 27 yarder to start the day for Jordy Nelson they're so first down Rogers past and Nelson again and he is spun down at the 29 yard line by Brian Poole a gain of 15 do you think the Atlanta Falcons really believed that it was even a chance that Jordy Nelson was going to play in this game well I don't know what they thought but I didn't think you would I really did and I thought that they would say well you know yeah this is a really important game the last week's game was important and you try to get him as healthy as you can but anyone who's had broken ribs I have not but anyone who's had him would tell you it's the most painful injury they've ever had so for him to be out here going through and doing what he's done already on this possession is awfully impressive on first down Pass is caught in the middle of the field it's Davante Adams is dealing with his own injury a twisted ankle from last week but here's that hit by Leon Hall on Jordy Nelson he stayed down on all fours on the bench area for quite a while he said it's the most pain he's ever been in in his life and during the week he had a tough time just drawing breath and here is a couple of weeks later taking hits in an NFL game with a trip to the Superbowl on the line second at four incomplete for Jared cook and Aaron Rodgers took a hit when he let this one fly its third and four well the Falcons have been able to get a little pressure here on this opening possession on Rodgers he hasn't been as comfortable in the pocket as we've seen in previous weeks Courtney Upshaw is the one who's able to get home at the end of that and he's got a big role in this game they lose Adrian Claiborne their second leading sacker last week and Courtney Upshaw he's going to have to help pick up the slack eight seconds on the play clock before third and four third down so critical in this game you cannot miss opportunity and this will be a big one on the other side of this break well we flash back to week game in this game the Packers and Falcons here in Atlanta Aaron Rodgers throws a touchdown pass to Jeff Janis the Packers lead by six fiftyeight Ryan answer Hamid sinew 31 ticks left and the Falcons won the game 33 32 and the two quarterbacks combined for ridiculous number seven touchdowns no interceptions in a combined quarterback rating of one 28.5 yeah we were here for that one and it was a lot of fun to cover and both of these offense of course the Packers they got on their roll than just a few weeks later and had been tightened up with a lot of points on the scoreboard averaging over 30 points a game during that stretch and then of course the high scoring offense in all football with the Falcons third down and four Rogers gets rid of it avoids this sack when it's fourth down Dion Jones the rookie middle linebacker got through Theon Jones number 45 it's just a fiveman rush and he comes up the middle they turned him loose somebody is supposed to pick him up Rogers was expecting it forces him to get the ball out of his hands and a big stop for this Falcons defense and now Mason Crosby who has hit on 23 straight during the postseason from 41 the snap from bread coud the hold from Jacob jump and Crosby it's been a while since he's done that in January this is the ninth game of this postseason overall kickers have been 33 of 33 before that mess by Mason Crosby his last miss in the postseason came here in Atlanta back in that 2010 divisional game and this should cost Atlanta five offense number 67 fiveyard penalty first down that's against Levite tree and Mike Pereira during the break we watched Jordy Nelson on that third down drop back by Aaron Rodgers looked like maybe a little holding out there in the edge no I thought it was a good no call Aaron scrambling to his left to his wise he's just throwing the ball when that happened I think you leave that alone first down at 15 now for the 26 freamon carries and he got hit immediately of the line his claim Matthews has been playing with that bad left shoulder and tears that go down into his chest he has a sack this postseason that came against the Giants you talk about guys that are playing hurt Jordy Nelson Demonte Adams and Clay Matthews each play basically the last four or five ball games in the regular season with a shoulder that may require surgery once this season is over he's been dealing with some pain of course on the other side of him dick Perry his fish those guys are going to be key and being able to get pressure on man second and 13 now Ryan fired sidelights anew Lana hit FiberNet 16 yards in a first down throw by Matt Ryan Mohamed Sanu he's in the slot too deep looked by the Green Bay Packers that's the hole within that zone and Matt Ryan exploits it and a lot of talk about Julio Jones he of course attracts a lot of attention the last time these two teams met Joe it was Mohamed Sanu who had the big game he had nine catches in that game Julio Jones just had three for 29 yards and so two new already off to a great start in this game first down pulls it back down passes clock torn low low beam toy low low who is big six eight fourth year player out of Stanford is good for five the Pro Bowl is headed to Orlando and returning to the traditional AFC against the NFC watch your favorite NFL stars compete the Pro Bowl coming up presented by Aquafina Sunday January 29th at 8:00 Eastern on ESPN 2nd and 5 and up to Freeman and Freeman is put to the ground by haha Clinton dicks a loss of two well for being so early in this ballgame still over three minutes left in this first corner he just get the sense that this is a critical possession defensively for this Green Bay Packer defense in not giving up any more points Micah Hyde laughs the edge as well right now a big third down for this Pakistan they're down in seven Ryan fires wide open pass caught Cooper first get out of law left all alone Austin Hooper picks up 16 Brian found him at the last instant well initially when Hooper gets the ball it looked like you know he was a little slow coming out of his catch and getting up the field to pick up the first down I couldn't see exactly who that was and missed the tackle they might have been Joe Thomas but if he makes the play Hooper is short of the first down quick snap playaction cry it out to his hair sinew 15 yards to Mohamed Sanu damarious Randall he did not play well last week at all he was spinning around in circles that entire ballgame and you see he's playing soft he's just a young players missed a lot of time he's had injuries this season and he is not playing with confidence and you cannot play in this league at that position if you lack confidence especially when you're going up against this receiving pole there's six games with surgery to his groin he's got under fire last week the same this way passes probably dropped by Robinson Robinson was open Ryan put it on him and that's the second drop here in this first quarter for the Falcons Dom Capers the man in charge of trying to figure out how to slow down the Falcons so far no answers for sanu and then seemingly every play somebody's left alone and Ryan's been able to find him I thought last week he was trying to call a defense with his hands tied behind his back and far as what he could do defensively that was against that Cowboys offense and this one is a much more explosive group than now since like Coleman if it appears at first down and it is that's the six different receiver Matt Ryan has completed a pass to well you said it a moment ago I mean they can beat you a lot of different ways you start focusing on certain guys the key guys and then you've got these backs both Tevin Coleman and Devonta Freeman who are outstanding coming out of the backfield they have over 80 receptions between the two of them and they make it awfully difficult on a defensive team Wildcat formation for the Falcons so new in the backfield it's the snap takes it himself Joe Thomas on the tackle and Kyle Shanahan is showing all the different facets that this Atlanta offense has here in the first quarter and levitra he comes out he leads the way and whether or not Mohamed Sanu is actually reading this but if he is he reads it well Devin Coleman's going to come across big Tom Jones gets up the field he comes underneath that picks up a nice game 35 seconds left in the first quarter second and three and it catches he works against Randall third and three that's gonna be the matchup a good part of this game is to Marius Randall on Mohamed Sanu because on the other side they really want ladarius Gunther to match up with Julio Jones with some safety health and Gunther he the last two weeks he's drawn Odell Beckham jr. and then last week he had Dez Bryant and today the task gets no easier on him with Julio Jones ride is four for four on third down so no at the bottom I'm 33 levitra moved I'm pissed over 67 fiveyard penalty still third down it's a big help right now for the Packers the Falcons four for four on third down I'm going to say it again Matt Ryan the last four plus games is now 34 for 39 on third down third down and eight now with 26 seconds left that's how he started Jones in the slot with the packers playing the safeties why it would be a good spot for Ryan to go I flushed out penalty flag on the play and Ryan fires to the back of the end zone looked like it was thrown in the area where there would be a hold against Atlanta it is I would assume McCarthy would decline it bring up fourth down holding office number 51 that leads decline Mozilla category fourthdown what time Pro Bowler Alex Matt who has really solidified this offensive line that's been healthy all year the only team across the NFL that started the same five guys that explains a lot when you have that kind of continuity with this offensive line and not missing any starters all year long they've been so effective offensively in your ride outs man who got voted to his fourth pole bowl this year has been a key component in their offensive production next nnothing here's the penalty on Mac as he got a hold of date tone Jones it's a 10 nothing Falcon lead at home quarterback comparison not fair Aaron Rodgers has been on the field for less than three minutes and Matt Ryan in the offense for the Atlanta Falcons the top scoring team this year in the NFL they have started out hot trying to get to their second Super Bowl in franchise history 14 seconds left in this first quarter of Bosher Janice go out of the back of the end zone the Daytona 500 is just around the corner and the cast of the mick you've already made their plans hey Caitlin you want to come to my Daytona Day party you're having a party for the Daytona 500 yeah why you drive a hybrid with two baby seats in the back well a beer oh yeah I mean there you go happy Daytona day right around the corner and Super Bowl 51 will be right here on Fox February 5th second possession for Green Bay and this for the Packers their largest deficit during their 18 win streak and we're not out of the first quarter bass is caught ty Montgomery and that's how the first quarter will come to a close will be second down when we come back here the Georgia Dome is the NFC Championship game today on Fox stop and sleep by 10:00 NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell is in attendance as the NFL says goodbye to the Georgia Dome final game five more events are scheduled here Malkin spent 26 years at Fulton County Stadium this their 25th and final in this dome and the Packers ten point hole to start the second quarter Rogers throws has a man a first down and Randall Cobb who went off and gamed one of the playoffs against the Giants makes a catch and a run for 17 well they come off the slot Randall Cobb then was expecting maybe the ball to be thrown to him right away but Rogers with enough protection in the pocket hangs in top slicing through the middle of that defense Falcons playing zone coverage there and when these two teams met the last time they opened the game in zone coverage and the Packers really exploited that they had a tougher time when the Falcons managed up in man in that second half that time zone covering and Rogers gets a nice game Rodgers out to his right deadly outside the pocket throws back across it field for Cobb and the numbers that Aaron Rodgers is putting up outside the pocket are mindboggling that one good for 22 but when he's been out of the pocket his quarterback rating is perfect one 58.3 during the postseason he's so accurate with the football but you can imagine what that does to a defensive back whenever told is outside the pocket in your tray and then cover these receivers for an extended period of time they're most impossible to do and aunts here to Montgomery McCarthy wants ty Montgomery to touch the ball 10 to 15 times in this game that looked for 3 Aaron Rogers has a lot of fans in this league including the contemporary like Tom Brady it's fun to watch him play I was love watching him play and whenever he's on I usually stop and watch I would imagine Aaron Rodgers says the same thing when Tom Brady's on television Tom Brady and the Patriots take on the Steelers later today in the AFC Championship Game Montgomery limped off kristan Michael in the backfield and out of the backfield makes the catch dancing around and went backward a gain of three could have been maybe a bigger play and here's ty Montgomery who was a little gimpy getting off the field after that carry on first down well then that puts Kristin Michael he wasn't even with the Packers the less than in these two teams play but they've only ran the ball twice here in this first half and the Falcons have played a lot full coverage the packers run the ball better than they give credit for but Mike McCarthy sticking with the patch play clock is already under 10 and they're going to reset the play clock that was a break as the ball moved the official jogs in and instead of the Packers potentially having to call a timeout we get a fresh play clock 34 this way they're aligned right now the safety dropping down across the board quick throw pass clock first down Jericho numbers speak for themselves Jared Cook who had a high ankle sprain he suffered week three against Detroit missed six games the Packers are 10 and 2 when he's available as a weapon for Aaron Rodgers it was too easy for the Packers Keanu Neal the rookie safety who's had an outstanding season he was the one dropping down he played soft and were able to get the completion and the first down there's Rakowski right up the gut and it's a one thing the Packers have been able to avoid during this eight game win streak for the most part turning it over and that ball is clearly out Jalen Collins he comes in once they're able to stand him up so to speak and he rips it out and it's Collins who ends up not just ripping it out but recovering the fumble 10 nothing Atlanta what a great individual play by Jalen Collins we'll show it to you again it's only the 3rd giveaway for the Green Bay Packers during this eight game winning streak and for this Falcons defense their 10th straight game with a takeaway and they're good at forcing fumbles they are forced 5 Beasley for 6 to twice playaction Julio Jones 17 yard completion back to the fumble we go you see Jalen Collins he comes in on the right side of the screen and he just does a great job textbook once the back is kind of held up he reaches in and pulls it out and then he follows it up and makes the recovery in Jalen Collins he's had a bit of a bumpy ride you see here Garon rip Kowski knows that that was a great opportunity for the Packers down in that red zone but Jalen Collins he was suspended for four games worked his way back into onto the playing field at about the time desmond Trufant went was asked to come in and play more playaction passes to Joan she gets his feet down 20 yard completion Julio Jones McDaniels he's applying a little pressure inside on fat Ryan but Julio Jones able to make the catch they're giving him some help it's man coverage underneath and ladarius gunther aegis gets turned around and that's not good coverage at all knowing you have safety help and you're in a trail technique and you completely lose the receiver as these defensive backs don't know where they're going right now on to Freeman on a toss Ryan on the stuff carrying there is one the Packers had a good opening possession went down at Mason Crosby who was brilliant the final two minutes last week against the Cowboys missed a 41 yarder next time they get it brickowski is plowing through defensive players for the Falcons ends up full momentum on the recovery brings it out to the 20th later here are the Falcons deep into Green Bay territory with a six yard completion for another first down nets Sunday it's the biggies versus the ACC in college hoops action on Fox Josh Hart number one Villanova hosts number 16 Virginia should be a good one tips off next Sunday at 12:30 Eastern only on Fox Dom Capers this up there scratching his head trying to figure out what he has to do if that ride has time in the pocket there is no way this Packers defense is going to be able to stop the fact that it brings a five man rush pick it up beautifully here's Freeman now it's so far not able to get their ground game going that's the only slow part of the offense to this point no gain by Devonta Freeman Dean Lowrey a rookie defensive lineman on the stop and now Alex Mack secondteam allpro center is down now look at him we'll take a break Atlanta with a football in a tenpoint lead in this NFC Championship game 51st year of franchise history for the Atlanta Falcons never won a championship trying to get to their second Super Bowl playing in their fourth NFC champion he's dropped Julio Jones and it'll be third down and ten we go back to the injury to Alex Mack and it was to find a Freeman who landed on the left ankle of Mack he thinks he'll be okay Ben garland has taken over its center and Mac is back in so garland in there for just one play max fine third and ten falcons are inside field goal range for brian pass is caught Jones steam inside the 15 these receivers are running free and clear through the secondary Dom Capers he brings a fiveman rush and you see that there's no underneath coverage then on Julio Jones there's easy releases these guys off the ball and given protection by four six on third down his Atlanta playaction Ryan I'm John Robinson really when you look at this defense for the Packers Joe the thing that they've been able to do a good job of down the stretch is they've been able to create take aways during the eight game win streak 18 takeaways by this Packers defense they give up yards but you knew coming in that that was going to be what they have to rely on in order to slow down this Falcons offensive the longer this game goes and the more ability that the Falcons have moving the football expect calm papers to start selling out just doing all he could usually when you see a run like this it's because the defense is in man coverage the Packers are playing zone Joe Thomas right there at linebacker II he has his eyes on the quarterback and he just is unable to make a play the Falcons have made this looked awfully easy here this afternoon Matt Ryan has his sixth career rushing touchdown his first since 2012 it's 17 to nothing in the likely MVP is playing like an MVP here in this championship game up 17 the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year award presented by nationwide recognizes NFL players who've made a significant impact on both the game and in their communities stay tuned at halftime when will exclusively announce the three finalists for this year's award and the winner will be announced at the NFL honors on February 4th at 8:00 Eastern here on Fox three possessions three scores for Atlanta they took advantage of the first career fumble by Aaron rip Kowski 80 yards play drivin a touchdown 14 yard carry by that Bukowski had a good run going but put it on the ground and the defense trying to find answers for Green Bay Atlanta up 17 little gamesmanship going on during the break that huddle on the sideline and Atlanta had to wait to see who they were going to have on the field defensively they had a couple of the bigger body guys up Sean Jarrett waiting to see if they were coming in and when the little receivers came jogging on Jarrett and Upshaw went back to the sideline as John man would say when the little guys came on the big guys went off that deal workers biggest comeback in NFC Championship history was here four years ago when the Falcons led the 49ers 17 to nothing Rogers diving catch by Jordy Nelson good for eight let's go down to the field and say how the chrismyers defensive line coach Brian Cox had better at Dwight three and emphasized in the first half for the line to play a quick off the line of scrimmage so they're not caught offside by Aaron Rodgers and it allows them to push up the middle and contain and I want that fast first step gel but not mister second and to pass out to the right incomplete for Nelson made the grab but was out of bounds according to the headlines minutes third and two I'm amazed at how Jordy Nelson is able to stretch for these last two balls he caught them first down play and then that one you know just outside of his reads unable to make it but this is broken ribs that's not easy to do this Packers offense you look at the score and you say well the Packers aren't really doing anything offensively they have moved the ball against this defense this is just their third possession they get pressured they missed the field goal to turnover big third down here for them bass takata's loan short it's fourth down and now the Packers go three and out after falling behind by 17 yeah you see Brian Poole he comes off the slot and puts the hit on Aaron Rodgers and that's why the throw was low and Rodgers he's having a talk with vinovich and he was hoping to see a flag they went for a completion but did not and here's Sean wings Aaron Rodgers hoping his defense can get a stop just took a hit Brian Poole it's been all Falcons so far offensive leaders for Atlanta Matt Ryan has started 15 of 22 different three drops factored in Mohamed Sanu with five catches a touchdown on a little flip pass and five catches for Julio Jones this drive will start at the 23 for the Falcons this year led the NFL by averaging over seven and a half yards on first down pass is caught by Coleman davon Coleman showing off what he can do running routes and a nice grab on a perfect throw from that Ryan yeah you called it Joe a perfectly thrown ball not bad coverage this time but Tevin Coleman the dynamic player he is he's able to come out on the option Ralph one on one there and beat his man and Matt Ryan puts it on him perfectly and Ryan already over 200 yards throwing it to call me well played by Green Bay Joe Thomas get credit he was not alone gain of three the job Thomas to beat trough did this offseason but they were able to do with this roster they addressed the defense the last two years since Dan Quinn took over as the head coach but the weapons that they gave Matt Ryan this offseason to complement Julio Jones it's really terrific we talked about Mohamed Sanu and going out and getting him and Taylor Gabriel who's emerged as a heck of a player and then with these two running backs take advantage as he's FIFA there's a mistake trying to capitalize and they can't Jake Ryan had a shot at the ball but Taylor Gabriel ends up on top of it looks like Joe they're trying to time it to where they snap it to Taylor Gabriel either that or it looked like Gabriel was expecting the ball but as he's right in line with Matt Ryan the ball comes out a missed opportunity for this pedicures defense and a takeaway that they desperately needed third down and tell Bryan in trouble gets rid of it pass caught by Coleman short of the first by Micah Hyde and Morgan Burnett let's go back to that timing play Jack Gabriel's looking for the ball he turns and looks and yet Matt Ryan was kind of acting like he was kind of expected to we're really fortunate there not to have given the ball to this Packers team with a with a short field but nevertheless the Packers finally make a stop in this game there's opportunity here for Green Bay to jump back in and they're about to get the ball back and they get the ball to start the second half washer the better punters in the league with Cobb waiting 42yard punt nothing on the returns Aaron Rodgers to deliver hope to the Packers you can download NFL mobile to watch every live NFL playoff game we welcome you back inside the broadcast booth I'm Joe Buck along with the halloffamer Troy Aikman there's hope here for the Green Bay Packers it has to start now at their own time this is an important Drive right now over three minutes to play they've been heavy pass which is what the Packers have really been all season long but they're starting to get pressure on Aaron Rodgers I didn't expect to see a little more balanced they're able to do that with this much time still left on the clock here before the end of the half but they're able to come away with a touchdown on the strive as you said to start the second half with the ball it could climb right back into this game even though the Falcons have pretty much dominated the first 30 minutes mark this one a drive starting at the ten there's three drives the vendee the miss they've been able to move the ball at times rogers throws and Rogers got crunched at the end of that play we've seen Brian Poole come off the edge now a couple times it happened on the previous possession on third down and Aaron Rodgers gets lit up here by Poole in the very end he doesn't see it it's a clean hit good hit but they he's not seen that blitz until he was hit at all then but he didn't catch on that third down either second and one passes so 244 on the clock two timeouts when Aaron Rodgers in this offense is rolling that's an eternity trying to get on the scoreboard Lane Taylor who sent a great year and Rygaard is down on a knee what the Falcons do is they just get you out of your comfort zone when offensively they're able to score the points like they have again today and then as an offense you start abandoning the running game and then it plays right into their hands teams have run the football against the Falcons but the Packers have just ran it three times here in this first half of course the last time they ran it with Aaron roof Kowski was a nice gain he fumbles the football but you know with time on the clock obviously they're gonna throw the ball and that's what Aaron Rodgers does and that's what this offense is all about but expect to see a little more bounce maybe a few runs on this possession but certainly when we get into the second half because they're starting to tee off on Aaron Rodgers backers made the switch they let Josh sit and go he ended up in Chicago had a good year with the Chicago Bears he's a tremendous player that meant that Lane Taylor was going to take over at guard and now with Taylor out it's done Barclay taking over his spot from Senator Cory Linsley Rogers open Nelson dropkick and they're seeing in completely I just put it right on Jordy Nelson could not make the catch there's good route by Jordy Nelson Robert Alford he comes in and is just able to knock that one loose at the point of the catch and makes a play on the ball we were all down there plugging these guys before the game trying to see if they would reveal anything about their status Jordy Nelson said I feel fine second and ten just got it away Rogers down he goes Rasheed Hickman just got him on the foot well Rashid Heckman right over the center Cory Linsley he goes right through him puts him on his back and that's something you just don't see very often with an arm and a hand putting Aaron Rogers on the ground twominute warning in Atlanta third and forever when we come back volley your favorite team all season long go to itunes.com slash NFL third down at 21 is any quarterback that can cover that kind of round its Aaron Rodgers just ask the Cowboys his third and 20 when he completed that 35 yarder to cook the set of the gamewinning field goal and now though you worry about the fact that if the Packers don't pick it up here here we are talking about them maybe being able to climb back into this game and to get the ball to start the second half they give the ball to the Falcons with all three of their timeouts for men on the pass rush Rodgers out to his right looking for Nelson and he's going to be down at the 31 they basically run the play that similar anyway that they got the third down two birds we call this time Rogers to the right they put TJ leg lock it up man Rogers does what he should do just takes a shot but there was no chance whatsoever Ricardo he's playing deep middle and Jordy Nelson he was playing defense as soon as that ball was thrown and that's essentially a punt yeah it is it's 55 yards of field position and it was third and 21 so in essence fiftyfive years they're first down three timeouts and then at 50 out of the shotgun caught Devonta Freeman gonna be marked down at the 40 enemy second and two underneath again first down Freeman into Green Bay territory like what Matt Ryan's not doing here and that is calling timeout he's got the Packers on their heels and he's continuing to a private pressure Ryan flushed out to his right pass and it was Nick Perry and coverage on Devonta Freeman let's go down to Erin Andrews jo an update on safety Micah Hyde for you Dom Capers called this guy invaluable the last few games he is questionable to return with a shoulder injury keep in mind this is a guy who's played every position in the secondary for the Packers over these playoffs Joe yeah he had the big sack last week the interception he's in the locker room wandering with the rest of the world what the score is going to be in the Hat for his teammates joining second and ten balsa in complete Mar when Evans was down there that ball was up there for about a half an hour and nobody comes down with it Albert Robinson was the closest Falcon to it it typifies what's happened in this first half for the Packers defense Marwan Evans drafted free agent he's in position to make a play on this ball and he just misjudges it means he's there it should have been an easy completion I'm actually shocked that Matt Ryan with pressure having to hold on to the ball and throw it late that he even took a shot down the field Atlanta takes the timeout they have two left and it gives us a chance to tell you that your former head coach and the rest of the group will have the Visa halftime report coming up they're here with us in the Georgia Dome and they'll have a little firsthalf analysis Christina pink from Foxborough before the AFC Championship game and announced the Walter Payton Man of the Year finalists so that's a couple of opportunities now to get a takeaway for this Green Bay defense Jake Ryan couldn't come up with a fumble on that exchange from the center back and that ball was up there for grabs from Marwan this time is jumped and you don't get many opportunities like that against this Falcons offense they just simply do not turn the ball over here come the Packers third down and ten for a first down Taylor Gabriel and he had Rollins all over him what a throw and what a catch Taylor Gabriel he pulls a veteran move here he comes across he slows up and is able to help shield Rollins there to make a play on the ball passes to eight different receivers here's one to frame take Freeman spins inside the 15 this guy Devonta Freeman he has some moves with the ball in his hands haha Clinton dicks he comes up to make the play and Freeman's just able to plant his left foot in the ground and ha Glen Dix had no chance whatsoever to make a tackle on him Vontae Freeman one of three backs this year with over a thousand rushing yards over 500 receiving yards he's on that short list with lay beyond bell in Ezekiel Elliott he forms a combination with Tevin Coleman it's the best onetwo punch in the NFL it really is what separates them is just their ability to run the football but the way in which both of them are able to catch the ball in that Kyle Shanahan he compared Devonta Freeman to Colt Beasley he said he could be our starting slot receiver he's that good in the passing game that says a lot nobody's covered Cole Beasley in five years see with that Campos done over the last four games meanwhile the Falcons are over 300 yards of offense they have one timeout left they have a first down at the Green Bay 14 it's been a half of big plays dan Quinn's offense 15 of them 10 or more yards this defenses been on the field plays already in this first half they're gonna welcome see if they can't catch a breath first headfirst to the five clock continues to run and Ryan's going to use the last time out well Falcons fans don't want to see this they deliver hope to Green Bay fans of 49ers and Falcons met in the 2012 NFC championship game at 17 to nothing in the second quarter for the 49ers went to work they founded a comeback won by a final of 28 to 24 there's Frank Gore baking it in and more heartbreak for Tony Gonzales who never got to the mountaintop as a team individually the best receiving tight end in the history of the NFL well Julio Jones this week he talked about that experience and said well then we were just happy to be there and now we're a different group and we know that we're not just happy to be here and we expect more but there wasn't many guys there's not many guys left on this team from from that group either a lot of young players this Falcons offense six total remained on this roster special chambers Bryant and Basha second and one blitz Ryan throws endzone nearly picked again gunther had a chance at it and now seven seconds remain on third down and one another missed opportunity for Green Bay ladarius Gunter that was not going to be an easy cash he actually plays it pretty well and undercutting the throw and comes underneath just not able to make a make the play on it would've been a nice catch if he'd hauled that one it remember no timeouts remaining for Atlanta so this effort has got to go into the end zone it's a got to be smart balls gotta come up quick on the line for green vein and some back down James touchdown make sure that he was in here on the catch close with Darius Gunther you know the situation and that the ball looks to me like it's a touchdown the balls got to come out quick I expect the gunner to challenge him a little bit more off the line of scrimmage perfectly thrown ball and it sure looks to me like he's able to haul this in watch where this right foot comes down it taps in and then slides to the boundary and Mike Ferrara in the back of our booth says it's a catch and a touchdown and that would mean Matt Ryan with to third down touchdown passes in this first half but they're going to go for a scoring review they show the replay on the board here some celebrate it looked like Jones left foot down toes hit then they slide out of bounds and Mike Pereira says touchdown I'll go with Mike and you see that right hand gets extended a little bit by Julio Jones and well they're not maybe he got away with a little something there at the top of that route but that's a great job he's a terrific player you talk about what he's battled through he's such a big physical guy he takes a pounding but he does so much but my money he's the best receiver in football the Green Bay Packers were delayed by fog change their travel plans getting to Atlanta three and a half hour delay I've been hit hard here in this first reviewing the play the rule and Phil is confirmed before I mentioned Thomas dimitrov he's the man in the middle of the blue shirt and the owner of the Falcons was to the right Arthur Blank Rich McKay also in that box there he is on the far left and down below they have a terrific young head coach and Dan Quinn and the other three in that box the 24 to nothing lead with three seconds left in the half Marwin evans mistimed his jump could not come down with a pick and the tip by haha Clinton dicks off the hands of ladarius gutter gave Matt Ryan another opportunity of points and he didn't miss yeah that's the thing I mean they they don't give you many opportunities to create takeaways they were tied for first with the New England Patriots just turned it over 11 times in the regular season and the Falcons have made it look awfully easy and how about this crowd here at the dome they thought last Saturday night they were closing down shop and moving into their new facility next year and the Cowboys lose all of a sudden they get a chance to host the NFC Championship game and they're making it known the last time the Packers were shut out the postseason was that game where Michael Vick took the Atlanta Falcons into Lambeau Field at that point the Packers had lost a home playoff game majority of those games at Lambeau Falcons moved on in that game and they're trying to move on in this one to get to Super Bowl 51 well like we said the Packers get the ball to start the second half I would never rule out Aaron Rodgers and his ability to climb back into this game but the defense it made one stop in this ball game squib kick by Bosh here it comes up on and the return by Daytona Jones that ends the first half in the final football game in the 25year history of the Georgia Dome Visa halftime is coming up it is looking for their second Super Bowl in franchise history 24 nothing over Aaron Rodgers in Green Bay beats a half times today's excitement brought to you by the new Nissan Titan that was today's excitement brought to you by the new Nissan Titan as we welcome you back to the Georgia Dome beginning of the second half 24 to nothing Atlanta on top welcome back to the booth I'm Joe Buck along with Troy Aikman Atlanta is held up their end of the bargain for this supposed shootout now it's time for the Green Bay Packers to get something moving offensively yeah they're not gonna get that many more possessions the thing about the Atlanta Falcons is egg play small ball and take this clock down and run the football with those two outstanding running back so it starts right here for the Green Bay Packers they've got a score touchdowns of course and then of course the defense has fine ways to make a stop one stop in that first half 325 yards of offense by the Atlanta Falcons they got a monumental task ahead of them in the second half they're gonna climb back into this ball game yeah 271 yards through the air for Matt Bryan that is a first half personal career high for Matt the Green Bay Packers will start this second half with the football see the first half stats choice in 325 yards of offense third down conversion seven of nine the month of January the ten plus yard blaze 15 and the excellence of the Atlanta Falcons is on display here for the football world to watch Aaron Rodgers will start at the 25 Erin Andrews it's all yours and in speaking with Mike McCarthy I first asked him what did you say dirty Matt the half he said well you guys dug yourself into a huge hole and these mistakes have killed us defensively I said how do you stop Matt Ryan and he said hit the guy we've given him all day he's sitting back there he also said this is the second straight game we've had absolutely no contra offensively I said what's the key here and he said again turnovers guides a couple updates for you Lane Taylor Micah hideand Kentrell Bryce are all out of this game and with that Lane Taylor injury Don Barclay takes over at left guard you look at the defense and their inability to slow down Atlanta and that was kind of expected coming into this ball game maybe not to the extreme the two things the missed field goal the fumble by ear and rib Kowski those were the real turning points and now it dropped to start the second half from Jared Cook and down to Chris Myers we go well it sounded like a party already in the Falcon locker room at the half a Dan Quinn Toby told his team reset that's how they played all season long players came out of the lock from yelling reset reset he said we're going to give the running game working in the second half we have to what's worked against Aaron Rodgers other than takeaways the three man but he said we will not Rogers just throws it away it's an incomplete pass ty Montgomery was there it went right toward his feet his Rogers was yet again under heavy pressure and pressure in the hands on the inside by receipt Hagin men and then off the edge you got Dwight free and Grady Jared so yeah with a fourman rush they have been able to get pressure on Rogers as well the Falcons have played basically five defensive backs throughout this game McCarthy did not run the football now with the score what it is don't expect to see many more runs in this game third down in ten passes drop threeandout starts the second half for Green Bay so two drops by cook in this first possession of the second half it's not an easy catch but one that he certainly can make we've seen him make a lot tougher and to come out and start this Drive the second half and to continue to have the problems that they had in the first half is demoralizing for this group that drive took 11 seconds here Shawn they're attached for wings it's been a dominant first half certainly for the difference of missed opportunities on green baize south earlier by mason crosby of 41 yards next time they have it they're marching in toward the end zone and rutkowski his first career fumble and then this ball was on the ground and right through the arms of Jake Ryan a chance for a couple of late first half interceptions Marwan Evans didn't time his jump right when Dix taps it with areas gunner can't come down with it and a touchdown followed Julio Jones and up to Freeman miss ville goal to start this game for the Packers by Mason Crosby it was a 7 nothing game at that point then the Falcons go down and they come away with a field goal of their own it's a 10 nothing game would Erin Murkowski fumbles no in a scoring opportunity that could have at least made it a onepossession game and since then the Packers have just gotten to where their everything's been a challenge trying to run the ball then a port or trying to move the ball and then of course being unable to stop and laughed showing blitz he comes with a blitz Falcons there's Jones flag is down Julio Jones with a catch still going still in bags touchdown but a flag is down back at the 35 and bill vinovich is going to call that official over and check and see what the call is probably going together with Darius Gunther on the call looks like that's where the flag came from no match to try to play man coverage on Julio down the path holding defensa 36 Jones he's had the turf telling this to games in December this one could from 73 yards out twice he walked the tightrope down the sideline and damarious Randall could not bring him down six three to twenty six of them took it into the end zone and what are these fans have fun here today or what number two seated Atlanta Falcons hanifi we then took apart Seattle even more impressive today against Green Bay Julio Jones 31 nothing the party is on here at the Georgia Dome the Atlanta Falcons took the opening kickoff went down the field and scored and they've been barely slowed since 31 to nothing jazz takes a knee the guys from New Girl are also getting ready for Daytona day the greatest Daytona Day party thanks nobody throws a Daytona party like you you know why cuz you're the best relax February 26th to that February 5th Super Bowl from Houston Texas Super Bowl 51 Matt Ryan has never been to the big game lions are dethroned with 344 yards washed it poor word past a timeout gummy incomplete say this defense may be better than we realize and it got better is the season one on it was awfully young coming into the year they start three rookies they have a second year player like Jalen Collins they lost Desmond Trufant but they're on the upswing right now they played great against Seattle and even better today the league better take notice cuz this defense is here to stay and they're only going to get better as they did throughout this year I expect them to be one of the real dominant forces in this game as we move forward in future years a lot of first and second year players they were last in the league in defending in 2014 the year before Dan Quinn took over Gummy's going to carry it for first Aaron Rodgers Oh for his last six with an interception as Keanu Neil the young safety they drafted out of Florida and the draft experts thought the Falcons reached four but dan Quinn was aware of Keanu Neal Quinn was at Florida was part of the recruiting process to get Neal to the Gators been a perfect fit what an impressive guy he is we had a chance to visit with him on Friday and wellmannered John he's going to be one of the real cornerstones for this defense when ezel Montgomery leave Kristin Michael takes over who gets it and goes nowhere hangman was in there on the stop and a loss of two well they're trying to get the running game going now after running in just three times there in that first half and see the total yards in the the difference between that that's amazing over 300 yards of offense this Falcons group I think the Falcons are more than happy to let Aaron Rodgers hand the ball off quitting we haven't seen the Green Bay Packers play like this since November when Aaron Rodgers said he felt like they were going to run the table eight wins later here they are in the championship game but not much is going right well then you think after last week's win against the Cowboys that there was so much energy and emotion expended in that win and what a great win it was and they're going to be able to get back to that level play in a big playoff game like this today but that a hard time you talked about the delay that they had arriving in Atlanta and what card impact that might have had I think they're going to grant Aaron Rodgers the timeout before the delay of game claritin explanation of the play clock Green Bank called timeout first charge timeout ty Montgomery goes in to get looked at well this Atlanta team remade the defense according to Dan Quinn's wishes beyond annealed of Andre Campbell Dion Jones secondyear players Ricardo Allen Jalen Collins Vic Beasley jr. and Grady Jared bank went for two years a defensive coordinator to the Seattle Seahawks quints trying to win by the way gift to his third super bowl over the last four years and kind of remade this defense and the Seattle Seahawks image when you play the style of defense that Dan Quinn wants to play a lot of single high safeties some zone coverage mixed in they play a little more man than what Dan Quinn played in Seattle you better have linebackers that can run and that's the first thing they did when Dan Quinn came in they addressed the linebacker the overall speed especially at that position they have to cover a lot of people in those under need zones and boy did they this is fast and a line back for as there is an all of football third down and 12 Rogers passes clock nice catch this time by Jared cook for a first down well one when you're on offense Jo and you're in a game like this and you're down 31 points you don't even worry about what the end is going to be like you just try to focus on one series one play and try to come away with some points it's something then worried about it the next possession and not focus on the huge deficit that you're faced with here's Clark gets a couple of blocks has another first down you can see on that previous cat cooked hit his head against the turf his helmet came off the official checked with him to make sure he was okay cook gave him the thumbs up and then comes back to the 12 yard catch for backtoback first downs 20 duck get away it's a rib injury we need to turn is questionable here's cook again and a nice play made by Keanu Neal well that's the other part of this whole thing Joe in terms of emotionally being able to get to that level just the number of injuries coming in who was going to play was really a gametime decision for Davante Adams and then Jordy Nelson and Morgan Burnett Bakhtiari was hurt last week we seen ty Montgomery leave fefe Lane Taylor left bar a at some point they've been overcoming so much all year catches up with you here's Mike Koval breaks loose first in reminiscent of when they wanted all in 2010 they came through Atlanta that first season they went into the Super Bowl with 15 players on and then lost Charles Woodson and Donald Draper in the third quarter in that game and they still won at all incredible Rogers has cooked with a first down inside the 10 the one thing that we have seen Rodgers is he's he's just not been on the bar like we've seen from him over this last date game win streak we've seen a number of times where Jared Cook has had to go down and make some tough taxes he had made all of them but they it's close yeah no changes that should be no challenge flag from and this one skips in to wrangle car sure I know a lot was made during the week about the flu that was going around the Green Bay Packers Mason Crosby had it Jordy Nelson had it Aaron Rodgers dealt with it you saw Aaron Rodgers before this game on the field would he tell you about how he felt he said he felt fine I didn't ask him specifically about if he was under the weather but that's a factor in anything that we've watched here today I think it's really this Falcon 'zed offense because for the first time in a long time we've seen Rodgers with pressure in his face and it has disrupted his timing within the pocket second and goal Nelson cannot break loose offered with a strong tackle and out of bounds it'll be third and goal backers knocking on the door their first touchdown of the day they need touchdowns I mean to me this is obviously two downs if they need them to get the touchdown this is a has really struggled down in the redzone they teams can score a touchdown and now timeout taken by Atlanta so each side having to take timeouts here recently in the second half the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year award presented by nationwide has been narrowed down to three finalists Larry Fitzgerald Eli Manning and Greg Olson who have all consistently upheld high standards both as players and as humanitarians this year's winner will be announced at the NFL honors show on February 4th at 8 Eastern right here on Fox well that's a great honor Joe and maybe the greatest honor you consider what it entails not just your performance on the field but more importantly what you do within your community so congratulations to those nominees there's a lot of people in this league as I often say a lot of players that give up their free on their days off and give back to their respective communities so says a former winner himself now third and goal Rogers Pass to Adams for the touchdown Rogers looks over to the sideline to check with Mike McCarthy it looked like he's holding up two fingers wondering if McCarthy wants to go for two but he's going to send out nice and Crosby and make it a 24 point game Vontae Adams is excellent off the line of scrimmage and he's able to get inside of Jalen Collins it's just a matter of Rogers putting it on him so the first points are the hardest ones to get and the Packers finally get on the board on the other side you see Jordy Nelson wondering what the play is was going to his left he found Davante Adams and Crosby makes it 31 to 7 land about to get the ball back early third quarter 919 left third quarter 31 to seven for a 12play drive took four and a half minutes off the clock Davante Adams what a great year had 997 receiving yards during the regular season was if he coming into this game after turning his ankle last week on a tackle against the Dallas Cowboys Devante Adams two catches eight yards in the twoyard score see if chronically kicks it deep it's always a chance for an onside kick falcons are up just in case and the play clock was at 0 this will be delay game play game kicking team number two fiveyard penalty still kicked off see Mike McCarthy's not happy about that role and I don't blame him it's it's there's no excuse I mean they're trying to get lined up there was some uncertainty with these guys as to where they were getting lined up I can't imagine that after that scoring drive that they're going to kick an onside kick as you said the Falcons are prepared for it I would expect him to kick it deep but Ron Zook the special teams coordinator whatever was communicated there was some confusion and now they're backed up five more yards into the end zone Eric Weems takes a knee Jody Nelson's been gutting it out all day long with his fractured ribs a frustrating day for the Packers down 24 couple things have happened that will get you caught up on it's the second week in a row first against Seattle now against Green Bay that Atlanta has scored on five of their first six runs and that touchdown pass to Davante Adams from Aaron Rodgers was the 100th touchdown pass in Green Bay postseason history Aaron Rodgers with Oakland one third thirtyfour it just makes it a 24point game toss to Freeman to the 30 pick up five and a tackle by Kenny Clarke and now the hard part now that you finally got on the board yourself now the Packers have to do something they've basically been unable to do and that stop man ride in this offense so far matt brien leads all rushers in this game with 23 yards and a touchdown 14 second and five to his left Matthews in pursuit with bang and they both converged to bring down Matt Ryan flag is thrown in the secondary here's bill vinovich to sort through it holding defense number 36 fiveyard penalty first down I'd say that qualifies certainly qualifies he knows asthma Ryan goes down with the takedown he gets up a little bit gimpy but ladarius gunner he was an undrafted guy at a college he ran a four seven coming out and he's facing a guy playing mantoman coverage that runs a 43 I mean there's no way you could cover that guy he knows it he just hold on to dear life and they've caught it a few times play she and Ryan throws middle of the field catch Jones gets flipped and hangs on unbelievable grab by Julio Jones and Jake Ryan who was in on the stop and there's Gunther who went low to take the legs out Ryan comes away injured on that play Julio Jones he could play any game you want to play if it requires him having to get physical he can do that he's a big guy that can run as I said a moment ago and he's as tough as they come and for him to be able to hang on to that ball oh go on to the ground that's that's it that's something right there this might be one of those times where as we see Jake Ryan come off we heard Chris Myers to open up this game pal Shanahan said yeah invariably in a game you're going to lose Julio Jones for a little bit he's gonna eventually work his way back onto the field but that was a a bigtime fall and catch by him he appears to be fine saw the numbers michael irvin by the way his the NFC championship in a game 192 receiving yards Julio Jones is fast approaching that he's got 167 news Freeman tough to bring down shifty he's strong he's compact he's got a 14 yard carry this is this is what you do you're able to run the ball and you know shorten this game here in the second half with a big lead he's difficult to get on the ground and follow up on Julio Jones these Packers know all about Julio Jones the whole league does earlier in the year he had a 300 yard receiving day and then just against these Packers two years ago we went for 250 nine yards so he's had some big afternoons in one of which came against these pastures then on the Staten Island in the middle of the second quarter here is a conversation on the sidelines and it's Julio Jones who's doing all the talking and it's been Julio Jones who's been doing all the receiving since I think Julio Jones was saying hey throw me the ball that can't cover being Mohamed Sanu he spoke box two now Taylor gay bride they haven't been able to cover anybody Julio Jones by the way 11 cats 182 yards two touchdowns in the championship game four years ago against San Francisco no Joe we talked earlier about the job Thomas Dimitrov did you know in terms of building a defense and some players from hammeron and will Ted Thompson you know back two years ago he drafts damarious Randall and then he brings in Quinton Ron some quarters with their first and second picks last season and they're going to match up against these wide receivers in the spread offenses and those guys have been hurt a lot but so far their second year they have not lived up to the billing temperance is the ball comes in in coverage flag was thrown when those two bodies hit the turf here's the call fasten appearance I don't really like the call to be honest with you he got turned and he's trying to make a place he's trying to locate the ball there is a little bit of contact there but no I don't like that call Mike Pereira what do you say hey did this agree Troy but I really do think it is he does get his head around but is he make it a legitimate play on the ball he certainly plays into the receiver well I'm not gonna argue I'm just saying hey these guys have had a tough afternoon let's get first call from the one Freeman I never seen you fall out of an argument that fast about toy Lolo though I mean this guy he he's primarily a blocker he's a he's a tall rangy guy 6/8 predominantly a blocker he's only had 13 receptions during the regular season but when he does catch the ball invariably there for 30 or 40 yards down the field he's a hefty 20 yards of carry her excuse me 20 yards of reception this season Neches hey he's just another guy that defense is that occasionally worried about it's on top of another loose ball that the Packers can't pick up and it'll be third down and goal Julio Jones will come back into the game and there's the center quarterback exchange from Alex Mack so third down and goal with four and a half to go third quarter slap to the left Morgan Burnett was there those two fought for the football and it's it'll be fourth down just outside the goal line a strong catch by Devonta Freeman yeah that was a it was really challenged here by Morgan Burnett as he comes in and that just kind of tells you why during a peak on it where that ball is if it's about a touchdown Matt Ryan wants his bench to challenge this call sure look from that angle that he had possession and it was a touchdown is it there is there a definitive look down that line and here comes a challenge Atlanta's challenging the ruling on the field that the receiver was short of the goal line timeout the call is it's fourth down on the field is there a definitive look to say it's another touchdown for the Falcons this one for Freeman we'll get the call right now from bill vinovich after reviewing the play receiver acquisition of ball over the goal line Mike Ferrara you told us before this game started that it was in good hands with Bill vinovich and this crews done nothing to dispute that you like this Paul I like the call Paulie Wagner and the replay booth New York chiming in the question is control did he maintain control of the ball after that first contact which he did and the ball was breaking the plane at that point so that's a good decision this to make it a 31point game again today bad rides have in this afternoon I agree with you Jo you mentioned it earlier I think he's going to be the league MVP and welldeserved and the only thing keeping him from being mentioned amongst the greats in our game is getting on and winning a world championship is no good and it's a 30point game at 39th President of the United States Jimmy Carter and Rosalyn applauding a 37 to 7 game thirty point game and man Ryan you said the presumed MVP with an MVP light performance for touchdown passes and a 14 yard touchdown run he's been fantastic well next year is will be a 1.5 billion dollar stadium that's going up next door it'll be a home to the Atlanta Falcons they are so proud of this facility those who have been in it they say it's breathtaking with a board that literally rims that upper circle in the center mercedesbenz Stadium right next door look around the league there are some incredible stadiums that have been built recently Rogers out of the shotgun take off he's got a lot of room to run still going and Aaron Rodgers who ran for a seasonhigh 60 yards in that week eight matchup here in Atlantic it's 28 that shows you what Aaron Rodgers is made of right there as he gets through the line there was no thought whatsoever of sliding when he got there instead he's going to take it as far as he can and not worry about whether or not he takes a hit it's whose longest run of the year on first down here's rip Kowski his poor guy he has the fumble early he's really frustrated got a big enjoy having on their team the second year Pro out of Oklahoma a sixth round pick and I've taken the role of John Coon and there have been a lot of drops today for the Green Bay Packers and TJ Lang who missed three games earlier in the year with a broken foot named to his first Pro Bowl is down and needs attention another injury and we were talking about it yesterday Joe I mean they practice on Saturdays and it seems like every time we've had a Packers game somebody's gone down in a Saturday workout and it's remarkable and I know that Mike McCarthy spends a lot of time evaluating how he's doing things in the practice schedule and how to keep the players healthy that's become what this league is about really is just making sure you get to Sunday healthy enough to play but the amount of injuries that this organization has had not just this year but for many years we can guarantee if the party will be taking a hard look at the way they do things and trying to correct it but I haven't seen any team decimated the way these Packers have been for many years they're still looking at TJ lang this guy is a tremendous pro 8th year out of Eastern Michigan he's not a great year CJ Lange he finally got voted to his first Pro Bowl and he missed some time you can see he's in a he's in a great deal of pain right now now Jason sprigs the rookie will join John Barkley two guys off the bench and the Packers are out of off extra offensive lineman I said this during one of our hits earlier in the pregame the Green Bay Packers by came on October 2nd it's been a long push si lang emotional with that injury to me it's been hard just to try and stay healthy week to week ready go fifteen guys on the injury report coming into this game Falcons at four Rogers throws and the pass is picked intercepted by Jalen Collins what a game he's had and Collins goes down at the 30 we'll take another look it's a turnover so they'll take another look as well that ball looks to be on the ground hard to tell if his forearms were underneath the ball or not the ball definitely hits the ground but did he have clinging possession of it can I get the ball into Randall Cobb he does not work back through the football Jalen Collins is able to drive on at least make a play on it whether or not it holds up as an interception Mike Pereira in our booth thinks it's incomplete not an interception as this ball goes through the arms of Collins then gets trapped against his body but we'll wait and see it's not all that clearcut if it holds up as a turnover it's the third of the game for the Packers in the second interception for Aaron Rodgers who went 318 straight throws without an interception before he was picked by the Cowboys last week I'm going to go back to that TJ Lange injury Joe and by no means am I suggesting that a practice schedule would prevent the injury that he just suffered the point being just amazed at how many injuries the Packers team has had and it's continued again in this ball game this is just today kentrell Bryce was hurt on the opening kickoff Micah high to shoulder lane Taylor's out with a knee Jake Ryan is out with the shoulder in timeout Gummer e his return is questionable with a rib injury and now TJ lang emotional and able to compose himself here comes a call from Bill vinovich tell you more about laying in a second after reviewing the play prior to the defender possessing the ball the ball hit the ground it's an incomplete pass it'll be 30 play at the 47 yard line please reset the game clock for 3 minutes and 27 26 second just to finish on TJ Lang it was a great guy as we said going to his first Pro Bowl his future now is very much in doubt depending on the severity of that injury he's a free agent to be so he's coming off one of his best years he finally gets voted into the Pro Bowl and here in a 30 point game with under five to go on the third quarter he gets that injury that has to be part of that reaction from TJ I think you're right and I think also Jo in addition to that the reaction that we're seeing from TJ Lange you can tell that he believes it's something extremely significant and it's difficult when you're talking about knees when you see somebody walking off the field I played with guys mark Stefan asking my center he played five more snaps after he needed to complete reconstruction so hard to determine anything based on his ratings it looks like he thinks it's a pretty significant stirred down in 10 the pass is caught by his fourth down coming up quick tackle by Robert Alford and Adams can't be getting up with his bad ankle Packers will go for it on fourth and 2 now Adams has to checkout Rogers will take it himself slide with the first down Robert Alford with the hit into Aaron Rodgers at the end of the slide personal foul unnecessary roughness defense number 23 that one Mike Pereira does not agree with and neither does this crowd at the Georgia Dome Mike you don't agree with that call well you know let's see what the bill vinovich has to say after further discussion the quarterback did not slide feed first therefore it can be hit that's why I didn't like the call because he didn't slide feet first so he really doesn't get any protection it's not late and he really hits him in the back area and and I just think again good crew discussion at least of getting together figuring this out so there you go did you pause him be honest but I didn't I didn't I did it's a sevenyard carry for Aaron Rodgers and still a first down more than two two and a half to go third quarter Rogers Pass caught cheered cook could throw by Aaron Rodgers and cook out of bounds with a first down just inside the 14 a gain of 18 it doesn't look like bucks but this is this is probably Aaron Rodgers his best role of the day as cook comes out of that route the ball is perfectly placed on him and there hasn't been a lot of those in this ballgame from Rodgers and then when he has delivered the ball as you said earlier Joe when they've had a lot of drops in this in this one as well within 5 Green Bay Packer drop hoodie on first down the Rogers out to his left to his lap he has to pull good coverage and this time the more clear slot I'll mark him down outside the six it was good coverage and Rogers did not want to have to run with the ball he was trying to do everything because of the score in this game just to score as quickly as possible but the falcons they hold up on the back end and ventually that had to tuck it sicken and to pass is caught somehow by cops and a good play out on the edge by the rookie Brian Poole the calm kind of snacks that one right out of the air that one had a little something on it Brian Poole he's an interesting guy you talked about all these young players on this defensive and he is an undrafted free agent out of Florida another guy that did when knew when he was on that staff and when you're able to find a third corner and especially a slot corner as an undrafted free agent that speaks volumes for your personnel apart pretty cop picked up the first down pass is caught by Nelson for the touchdown seen Jordan Nelson wincing in pain as this game has gone along but he's still out there playing Chloe how tough he is and the Packers now will go for two as they trail 37:13 we saw Davante Adams earlier the touchdown that he got was on the slant route Robert Alford he he slips as Nelson starts them to the outside and comes underneath that when you get down to these areas and critical third downs against the Packers you can expect to see the slap routes they throw them as well as anybody in football this will try to make it a 22 point game backers on the year for for attempting a twopoint try Davante Adams back out there at the bottom of the screen here you go will he go here's Rakowski gonna plow his way in for a twopoint conversion it's a 22point game with this NFC championship still in quarter number three like an old Oklahoma drill with Keyon O'Neal jumping into the the gap he's going to come down and it's just him and Aaron roof Kowski and who's going to win that matchup good blocking up front oneonone Rakowski drops his shoulder and is able to drive his way across the goal line Sohrab Kowski plows it in I can see your favorite Troy NFL players show off their strength speed and skills in the new Pro Bowl skills showdown on Thursday January 26th 7:00 Eastern they'll miss the 2017 Pro Bowl presented by Aquafina on Sunday January 29th of 8 Eastern on ESPN saw here a trip Kowski walking off the field that right arm was dragging a little bit that's the shoulder that he used to go through Keon O'Neill it looked like they're gonna give him a little bit of attention and make sure he's okay to the point now Dorsey Levens was the honorary captain for the Green Bay Packers they might try to find him with Jersey in pads the ranks are getting thin for the Green Bay sideline with these injuries in this game and they have plenty coming in only one player is back that's hearty is taken by sinew and he gets tripped up at the 28 he was sure if they can touch down see exactly who it was that got a hold of him but Mohamed Sanu he catches this one he gets the good bouncing and he sees nothing but endzone in front of him that was Marwan Evans who just got enough of mom it's Anu the ball to the 33 first down toss to Coleman right sure gain for Tevin Coleman of one Blake Martinez on the stop so initially they had Sidhu down at the 28 moved back to the 33 and we are through three quarters in Atlanta one quarter left and the prize at the end of this one Super Bowl 51 for the winner Atlanta Falcons leading by 22 with the football fourth quarter coming up after this from your local Fox station what a day for Matt Bryan to look at today's top performers Matt Ryan with his four touchdown passes one rushing touchdown it's the first time that's happened in Falcons history today is game number 805 in franchise history combining the regular season and postseason 51st year here's Gabriel breaks one tempo and he picked up nine third down then one coming up haha Clinton dicks on the stop Taylor Gabriel he was he went to Cleveland his undrafted guy when Kyle Shanahan was the offensive coordinator a couple years ago with the Browns and they've given away the money that they were going to pay him when he went undrafted and he was about to sign with the Oakland Raiders and Kyle Shanahan said look if you sign with us we guarantee you you will make our team and so he signed with Cleveland he makes the team and brings him here to Atlanta there are 2x Cleveland Browns that are heavily involved for Atlanta Taylor Gabriel and Alex Mack who was there for seven seasons and obviously never tasted the postseason and Cleveland comes into play Troy with the trade that Thomas Dimitrov made in 2011 when he traded with Cleveland to move up from the 27th spot to the sixth position to draft Julio Jones but how about if you're an undrafted guy and you're told by a team under half the guys it's hard to make a clock but you're told I guarantee you I promise you you will make our team if you sign with us that's a nobrainer here's Coleman right side cuts it sixteen I was gonna say I'm not sure what that says about the Browns receiving core at the time but I do know receiving core well meanwhile they drafted five receivers in this past Draft and that meant that Taylor Gabriel was squeezed out you know the story with Cleveland they did get a win but wins have been hard to come by talent has been hard to come by game breaking type players should they'd like to undo that second and six Ryan gets hit as he throws it passes incomplete for toy Lolo Ryan has pulled up and right now if you're Dan Quinn and what is a twenty two point game you're playing keepaway you're playing keep number two healthy that's right I don't want to see him getting hit they're not able you know the Packers have done enough and with their beat as much time left you still got to play your game and do what you do but no question Dan Quinn not wanting to see Matt Ryan on the ground jeselsohn interested observers were the point total at 52 they're down in sixpack now inside the Florida Senate first and goal what a game what a player they go mantoman with Quint Rollins this time and you see the separation with julio jones dangerous collision there is he lowers his head right at the to this play to see that but julio jones in addition to all of his physical skills is obviously a very great player as well because they can line him up in a lot of different places and he's hard then to get a bead on as a defense trying to double him up and all the different routes and he's capable of running falcons are now 10 for 12 on the third down in this game Coleman on the toss touchdown working up the tunnel who gets a highfive from Tevin Coleman who carries it in for another Falcon touchdown Patrick DeMarco 42 he's leading the way now flank oven needed to go 80 yards he could have gone 80 yards there's nobody out there riot has one missed extra point in the game for straight touchdown drives for the Falcons all smiles pointing their way toward Houston Texas another touchdown drive if sport touchdowns on their last four possessions and it's 44 to 15 Atlanta the crossbar and now we'll welcome you inside the broadcast booth I'm Joe Buck with Troy Aikman how about Matt Ryan this kind of goes about his business he's got a big contract people were wondering last year not a great year but man as he played tremendous football today a lot of pressure on his shoulders expectations were highs had a great year how is he going to play you know in the NFC Championship Game two and four in postseason games coming in today and you know now like I said a moment ago the the only thing separating him and it's the case for all quarterbacks I think we all understand it you're measured by what you do in the postseason and and championships and I don't know if I'm willing to say yet he's going to the Super Bowl but a SERP sir looks that way with an opportunity to win his first kasky on a screen the edge Trevor Davis Collins is here to force him out after a gain of 20 but I thought I thought Matt Ryan has been a great player for a long time I remember when he came into the league as a rookie and I hadn't watched him and went back and watched some film one day and I watched about five throws and I turned it off and you could just tell I mean he was well coached at Boston College he knew he was a special talent and now he's getting a chance to show everybody how good he is there's just throws it away now you rewind the tape and remember this game was ten nothing Atlanta second possession for Green Bay and repousse Key was going toward the end zone taken tacklers with him in this play that was made by Jalen Collins not only to force the fumble but then recover it who knows how big of an impact that first half well in the first two possessions for the Packers and missed scoring opportunities missed field goal the fumble by Ricky and after that then it's 17 nothing essentially his game holding second and ten Pass is broken up and a nice job defending by Robert Alfred she got his hand in there pastor Cobb third and ten a great piece done by Bill Pennington New York Times they ran yesterday we'll get into some of that about Matt Ryan next time the Falcons have the ball right now it's Green Bay facing third down and ten low snap Rodgers had the corral at first and cannot get away from Tyson Jackson we can win against the Cowboys Cory Linsley a lot of low snaps back that's a pretty unsettling for a quarterback when you have to concentrate that much on where the ball is going to be snapped but I don't think the snap had anything to do with the end result this was Falcons defensive front been getting after him Mike McCarthy wanted built vinovich to throw a flag for a facemask as Jackson came in with his that part of the face Minsk of Rogers no missing they thought it might have been to shoulder Pat Rogers trying to get it first down fires a fastball for the first down to calm man moving to his left and able to set up momentarily and then fire a laser to Cobb what a throw on fourth down he gets 33 we haven't seen as much of Aaron Rodgers outside the pocket but he's able to to buy some time we've seen so many times even just in recent weeks it delivers a strike books read ballsout and they're gonna say he was down the call is he was down by contact before the fumble I don't think the knee was down then the question is was there a clear recovery all was knocked out looked like before the knee touchdown and was there clear recovery the answer is Courtney Upshaw was there for Atlanta I would expect to see that challenged Quinn's not going to challenge it here's a second and seven years Rick asked you first twenty nine point game a gain of eight for Aaron Rakowski and a fresh set of downs for Aaron Rodgers moving at the speed in which you would expect there in the nohuddle but there's not a lot of urgency with the word go with protection now out to his left Campbell chasing him in the pass his short Jeff Janis secondary's done a nice job for Atlanta in this game yeah they really have and I think this Atlanta secondary is better than they get credit for if you just look at them where they rank in pass defense on the year and would say that their 28th but when you're playing opposite of great offense it's scoring a lot of points then you get into games like this where the team's thrown the ball a lot in terms of yards per pass play they rank ranked eleventh so they're there they're a much better group in covering receivers than at first blush Aaron Rodgers only three four eight completing passes out of the pocket in this game he's out to his left here completes to Allison when he hit the ground that will not be a fumble and looks to be enough for first down it'll be first and goal these are down ball comes out when the elbow hits backers hurry up catch the Falcons substitute back in the endzone for cook and hunters is aware of everything he was pointing over to sideline as an Atlanta defender just got off the field before that snap he rushed it on to see if he could maybe catch him first time Rodgers has tried that tactic in this game he got the Dallas Cowboys last week second and goal 59 flag is thrown free play Rogers he just throws it up incomplete but a defender came across early for Atlanta and it is against the Falcons yeah it's a good job Aaron Rodgers is awfully good it drawn a defense offsides and then he's especially good he he knew offside defense number 93 after the goal repeat stick it out they get Dwight Freeney in and once he knows he's got to play him he he knows that he's drawn the defense and now it's a question of whether or not I got the flag he looks to his left immediately to see if the flag was thrown trying to get a holding call there on the back end but as he's going the ground he was going to sling it up in the air and do something to try to give a chance because he knew he had to free play that's the first offensive penalty on Atlanta in this game 59 will he go we go red couch demos third and goal and Grady Jared was in with Rasheed Hickman they just bust right through that offensive line Jason sprigs who came in into TJ lanes place he's not able to come down and pick up that block and he's got a straight shot for the tackle this defensive front has really played well in this game not early on we saw some pressures by Dan Quinn in his defense but since the early part of this game man rushes and they've been able to do some goody bags in that time stop in the run third down and goal he'll try to run it in himself and can't get there it's fourth down Robert Alford was there to stop it flag is down and so's Rasheed Hickman see what happens with Rogers at the end of this play and he gets his hand up into the facemask of Robert Alford and rips a helmet off his head trying to stiffarm him and the hand came up high into the facemask meanwhile Rashid Hagman is down and there checking on him yeah he wasn't moving at all Joe and it was Aaron Rodgers was scrambling he ran right past Rashid Eggman he was just on the ground we third down so here's the facemask all against Aaron Rodgers today's a call to bakin Soder Rashid Eggman he came off the field on his own powers and the boy sure looked like he was hurt pretty good though hehe in the middle of that flight he just did not move at all been out of gas the way all the way to his left reverse course went all the way to his right came up short the Falcons by the way except the penalty it's a 15yard penalty but it gives Greenbay third down instead of fourth down Rogers was stopped short of the end zone its third and goal timeout taken by the Falcons they have one left there's been a lot of pressure on Aaron Rodgers in this game there it's Deon jobs the edge hit hard Jason Jackson the sap on this possession 657 left will be third and goal from the 18th he has gotten hit a lot those are hits that you just don't see quarterbacks take very often in today's game they were they were clean hits full coming off the edge but they did they roughed him up pretty good early and as I said that is the game wore on not as much pressure by Dan Quinn but this defensive front the challenge of course was to disrupt Aaron Rodgers in the pocket we've done a good job of that throughout this game third and goal in John Janus and the call will be against Robert Alford it's time they get all four he's got hands on the receivers Jeff Janis expecting that back shoulder fade and there's contact and Robert offered he pass interference defense number 23 Paul Kearney end zone first time his left hand on Janus and I think it's the right call and offered he's been plagued by that throughout the season he leads this defense or leads the team actually in penalties he's been penalized 12 times pass interference and illegal contacts and holds just has not been able to clean that up it's something that's been a bit of a problem all year at six defensive pass interference cost time for the secondmost in the NFL during the regular season now first and goal from the one here you go Pass is incomplete for cookkey anima Neal is therefore Atlanta and we've seen that reaction from Aaron Rodgers quite a bit today a little different story here after this eight game winning streak and over his last nine games coming in Rogers 24 touchdowns one interception today 26 of 44 286 two touchdowns and one interception second and goal pass is caught for the touchdown Jared cook and Rogers will stay out on the field as the Packers again will go 42 he draws the rookie Keanu Neal and Rogers throws the ball and makes cook go get it I'm going to come away with a touchdown on this drive they'll go for to the onside kick and see what might happen 6:43 remaining hackers handed a to riff Kowski last time he got it in Kristen Michael comes back in for Green Bay I would expect him to work here or cook us this to make it a 21point game hand off his to Michael doesn't get it Vic Beasley made the play and will have no doubt an onside kick try when we come back the Falcons again expect an onside kick try by Crosby the last one was recovered by Mohamed Sanu 14 play drive 75 yarder and it's a 23point game clickers always looking for that second bounce doesn't get it right into the gutter Mohamed Sanu Falcons takeover 643 left 4421 that made this look awfully easy here this afternoon the boss sits at midfield the Falcons habit there's Matt Ryan who's had the first game in Atlanta Falcons history with four touchdown passes one touchdown run and see the possessions today one punt one field goal touchdowns I've ever seen it look that good so it's pretty amazing there expect the ground game its Freeman Daniels on the stud it's talking about that article that was written by Bill Pennington in the New York Times about Matt Bryan who was the number three overall pick in 2008 went to the playoffs that year as a rookie they ended up losing he grew up playing with family and friends in Bill Henty Park in North Wildwood on the Jersey Shore his grandfather Sam a Pearl Harbor survivor his quote was games are played with a pen I listen to all those years most coolguy just a really good NFL quarterback bordering on great and he's played this place great here today he has he's played great all year long and Kyle Shanahan the offensive coordinator he's had a little bit time with the way in which he fence number 52 fiveyard penalty Matthews trying to get a jump is guilty of the offside the way in which Pam Ryan has played and he's the oddson favorite to take that San Francisco 49er job and they don't have a quarterback on that roster like Pat Ryan and things if he does take the job they get a little bit tougher no Thomas dimitrov he talked to Kyle Shanahan and said hey you got a good thing going here in Atlanta a lot of a lot of good pieces to work with and he's done a math marvelous job coordinating that group but and out to Freeman Freeman just won't stop until he gets to the 40 and that's a first down Kyle Shanahan last year was the coordinator of this offense and it really wasn't clicking they got out to that 500 start but it was a major transformation that Matt Ryan had to make to the amount of verbage that's in the offensive play calls and he said I'd go into the huddle I was more worried about getting the play called right than what I was going to do once the play started and you talked to him this week about that Burbage is fine now for Matt Ryan and we're seeing all he can do there's Coleman now stop you know a lot of Kyle Shanahan when he learned offensive ly you would think it came from his father he wanted to have a running game like Mike Shanahan had over the years with the Denver Broncos but he learned a lot of his philosophy and an offense from Jon Gruden spent the years there on that tampa bay staff and Jon Gruden is known for the long verbage within the West Coast offense and making those calls and and some some of these West Coast gurus have simplified things a little bit but Kyle Shanahan has not and when you're a quarterback having to think about what you're calling instead of just letting around letting ability take over reason why you're not as sharp right Burnett is there to tap him down well after the Falcon victory in the 1998 NFC Championship game head coach Dan rage did the Dirty Bird and then last week Falcons owner Arthur Blank did his own celebratory dance would say what what you win it all looks good you know he'll probably be in there dancing after this one too it should be no danceoff scheduled between he's brought down in the backfield by Martinez it's fourth down and the punt team comes on for the Falcons with under three and a half to go Matt Bryant is going to check in as well so looks like they're gonna try a long field goal I was watching him in warmups from from 58 yards this distance right here and he was making them with all kinds of room to spare it's going to be a 58yard try the play clock is winding down Matt Bryan says he's comfortable at 60 so even with this lopsided score and final timeout Dan Quinn's going to try to tack on three more Matt Ryan played his high school football in Philadelphia area was a triple option quarterback didn't throw the ball that much but showed enough to Boston College where they wanted him that's where he developed the home Madi ice nickname and he was the third overall pick the Falcons have him locked up and there's word that they may they may end up redoing his deal in the days to come and further extend of it now Dan Quinn has thought better the field goals yeah there's a little too much that can happen that's not good from that distance to just try to come away with three points I think he thought things over he making a good decision here to punt it Bosher Davis dancing nets or theme going to break Arthur Blank rubbed off the fans into it here in Atlanta final game of the Georgia Dome all Falcons Aaron Rodgers will finish this NFC Championship game on the sidelines with 236 left 44 21 game Brett Hundley is now in the huddle and ready to show us what he can do in the last two and a half minutes he's been a preseason star taking over at the funny a threepoint game handoff is to Kristen Michael and he's brought down immediately you don't get a lot of work when you're the backup quarterback Aaron Rodgers he just had this ten past attempts for the season but you know we've talked a lot about the Falcons Joe the Packers the further you go along in the playoffs the more disappointed you are well then when you lose and this is hard it's hard for a team in the NFC Championship game to not win but the Packers have a lot to be proud of they overcame an awful lot to get to this point I know it doesn't make them feel any better but they really had a nice run there go down celebration about to kick into high gear here in Atlanta what's on the line back and a trip to Super Bowl 51 well coming up next is the State Farm postgame show Matt Ryan what a moment this is for him validation is on the verge of his third career postseason victory in his first Super Bowl and for the Falcons their second touchdown for Matt Ryan as Kristen Michael carries it takes it to the 10 tell these guys how much he has meant to this organization she treats him holds him to a high standard it gives them some flexibility within the rules he's built some a culture that has pretty rocks of real teamwork I'm keeping for the first down just short of the 25 trying to get encouraged these guys to spend more time together then he gets the ceremonial thong the second year of 500 start last year as a rookie head coach an 8 and 8 finish and this year an 11 and 5 record the number to see and they'll represent the NFC Valken started four and three this year and they will end this portion of their season having won nine of their next 11 I'll say this in a few hours either Keith Butler the defensive coordinator of the Steelers or Matt Patricia the defensive coordinator of the Patriots and have a lot to worry about preparing to take on these Atlanta Falcons a lot of late nights for whoever ends up facing these Falcons and like we've talked about as many ways as they could beat you the thing they do best is they don't beat themselves so pretty you play smart football don't turn it over and then you Michael nowhere to go and that's it the Atlanta Falcons NFC champions August Superbowl 51 let's go down to the field and chrismyers Artie performance Matt congratulations a done career hurdle cleared for you and go to your first Super Bowl excited we played great today all three phases showed up we did exactly what we've been doing all year and it feels really good I know it's human nature
