  "transcript": "welcome to college football ah yes presented by Hampton by Hilton here watching the SEC on ESPN the number two team in the country on the road in primetime as number two Alabama night and all makes the 90 mile drive to Starkville the base number 16 Mississippi State the crowd is loud and hostile and Alabama likely will be number one next week if they can win this game because Georgia the current number one getting blown out at Auburn 4210 with just a few minutes left in that game Wisconsin a winner big over Iowa so four unbeaten teams left an FBS entering this level and hi everybody alongside Greg McElroy I'm Dave Pasch look at Tom luginbill in a minute well Greg Alabama has won 30 consecutive regular season games going back to the Ole Miss game in 2015 but this is a tough place to play especially at night you played here with Alabama the current quarterback for Alabama jaylen hurts he's been so poised great he's only turned over once all year he's done a tremendous job and so many people look at jaylen hurts they say where can he improve well he's 23 and 1 as a starter so top to a pretty dang good start but if you look at the way he works in the pocket there is a little bit of an issue with sometimes trying to escape a little too early he did a great job last the pressure in the pocket moving while still remaining a passer and keeping his eyes downfield right here on third down stepping up hitting Ridley over the middle but of course jaylen hurts he's got to be an athlete he's one of the best runners at the quarterback position in college football and if you don't contain him with your pass rush he can get out on the edge and make big plays happen the numbers will pedestrian but he took a big step forward maybe even a bigger challenge tonight though Tom luginbill going against the South Mississippi State defense well there's no question dragged in the guy to keep an eye on up front is number 94 Jeffrey Simmons he's the Lord daddy he's a disruptive guy that gets gonna be tasked to stopping those inside runs it is imperative for Mississippi State on defense to put Alabama and obvious passing situations which means winning on first and second down versus that stable of running backs now this is a defense has been opportunistic they create turnovers this is a team that turns turn in two points and if you're gonna beat Alabama it's tough to do it without them helping you they points they need to have a breakdown in the kicking game you to take those turnovers seven turnovers have been forced by this Mississippi State defense three of them returned for touchdowns something like that happened tonight for Mississippi State to have an opportunity during this fourgame win streak for Mississippi State it's not just about causing turnovers it's about great plays by the quarterback Nick Fitzgerald who has rushed for over 100 yards in four straight games the first SEC quarterback to do that in 20 years and talk to the Nick Saban last night he's concerned yeah I mean lake Fitzgerald just from an athletic standpoint is as good as any in college football he hasn't yet hit that ceiling but he's on his way there and to win tonight he has to put together a superhuman effort he's gonna do it by trying to get to the perimeter in the run game he's also gonna have to throw in two very tight windows Alabama's secondary is a lead who's gonna be accurate and on time when he does deliver the football he's also gonna have to rely on Dan Mullen one of the best offensive minds in college football he's got to get some guys open for Nick Fitzgerald and when those open guys are there he's got to deliver the ball accurately Alabama defensively a little bit beat up at the linebacker spot though Tom there's no question that the Alabama Crimson Tide they're banged up they're playing without four start tonight went down in the last two weeks this is a concept based defense it relied the Punk communication this is a defense where the linebackers of the quarterbacks and so look for Mississippi State tonight to try and get some of these younger players Keith Holcomb number 42 the true freshman number 18 Dylan Moses get those guys to commit some eye violations move the formations around shift motion inside and get Alabama out of their element I would expect the young guys to play fast and not have to think too much Sonic's is first sec start and Moses is a true freshman meanwhile for Mississippi State the Bulldogs have some injury issues on offense their top three receivers are out bullet gear up to the season with an injury that happened earlier miles neither flyer available tonight ESPN college football brought to you by USAA showing your appreciation this Veterans Day using hashtag honor through action Xfinity experienced TV like never before with Xfinity x1 and Zales tis the season to save and sparkle more than ever injuries are injuries but when you get a rash of injuries at one particular position that is a little more difficult to deal with the other guys plan mr. newer faces but no nothing change this is the people that need a step up I think they know who they are we're gonna have to have some younger guys who have not played much be able to get themselves ready and get to the point where they can play winning football for us I don't know anybody that plays Alabama it's not the underdog outside this facility or no okay so we're gonna win give us a shot it hasn't happened any ASL and it'd be huge to be able to go out and play against a team that you've always been against your whole life is just go on the field jeffrey simmons with the chain is it to say usual so like that the Bulldogs sideline shows everybody else with cowbell in hand here at Mississippi State Nick Saban's last loss against Mississippi State was his first year as the head coach at Alabama the tide won the toss deferred selection so Mississippi State take a scout putting it away and Mississippi State will start on the 25yard line junior quarterback Nick Fitzgerald big guy six five 230 pounds from Richmond Hill Georgia but originally from Germany his dad Derek was in the US Air Force for 20 years Nick played receiver for three years until moving to quarterback as a senior playing for his father Derek in high school and along with Lamar Jackson Nick Fitzgerald they are the only quarterbacks with a thousand passing yards at 800 yards this season it's Janet deep on first down he's got a receiver throws a wide open teeth mix and that might have been a touchdown it certainly would have been a huge play to start the game trying to make a statement early talked about the perimeter rushing attack of Mississippi State faking that perimeter run trying to hit a deep post over the top and the deep balls that Nick Fitzgerald has missed over the two years as the starting quarterback here in Starkville have plagued this team from time to time few bigger than the one he missed right there because to beat Bama you got a hit on those with you get those opportunities play fake Fitzgerald in the pocket throwing again it's high over the head of the intended receiver Jordan Thomas the Nick Fitzgerald's got to settle down here a little bit here on the first drive coming out of high school was a triple option guy attempted just 76 passes coming out of high school really limited his recruiting two offers including Mississippi State and the key for Dan Mullen was getting this young man on campus getting him into camp so that he could evaluate him and that the young man could show what he was worth in person and if you can give Dan Mullen credit in any area he knows how to develop quarterbacks you talk about debt Prescott who was the predecessor for Nick Fitzgerald of what he did for Dan Mullins team the what he's doing now in the NFL big shoes to fill Fitzgerald has got a pretty good job so far coming into tonight 1310 another pass balanced a Fitzgerald is best player defensively you can see standing up on the right trying to create options up front just to delay blitz you have one on one on the outside evans pretends relaxes and then recognizes drop back and goes full speed to bring down Fitzgerald great start to the Alabama defense during that time the sixth set allowed by Mississippi State good Papa Bear caught by Marx at the 34 yard line here comes Jalen hurts I'm a proud Texan Ben from Texas is a little different I feel like we'd do it different you know you hit a motto don't miss it Texas there's just a fire thing there's a lot going down now that I say but the least I can do is pray for them on Saturday there was a penalty marker down without to wait for Janet Hertz to take the field here but hurts out of Houston a true sophomore he's responsible for 53 touchdowns 33 passing 20 rushing but for over six hundred yards this season over nine hundred last season there is a leaping penalty on the pot so it is a first down for Mississippi State the deserts at the ball on the 30 yard line leaping penalty on the pond called against the top so here's a hook on the punt and the defender for Alabama going over the top and that was the foul good call by the officials giving Mississippi State new light that to the three it out seconded to I gotta run Williams again and he stood up by Evans and Lake Borgne Davis Davis 6 7 305 so hard to run between the tackles against Alabama so sound defensively they almost always have guys in the correct spot in the correct gap and seldom do they miss a tackle Alabama's defensive group over the last decade have been among the elites in college football few better target inches just shot a 40yard line Williams again and good push by that offensive line which you say is the best offensive line to ban display this season they are especially the left side of the offensive line which was the point of entry there for Mississippi State's offense Martinez Rankin Dara Williams on the lefthand side they're big they're physical and this Bulldog front really plays with the chip on their shoulder they love to set the tone upfront they've done a good job of it over the last three plays Rankin back and left after missing time due to injury Fitzgerald getting to the perimeter before he slumps out of play after a gain of about three or four so important to have Rankin back and left tackle he had an ankle injury that costing four games played a little bit last week and a win over UMass they need him obviously tonight if they're gonna win this game against second ranked Alabama it's so hard to contain Alabama up front especially when you're not in the hundredpercent fortunately for the Bulldogs Martinez Rankin very well regarded throughout the SEC and by NFL scouts so they spread it out here on second down and seven fits jail one of his passes have been highdollar down on the roads it's a 44yard line trying to get Nick Fitzgerald into a rhythm throwing it first two passes were off the mark now you try to bring it underneath with a slant very advancable tax roll on the facemask and a nice pickup for the Bulldog offense Greg he's gonna have to be accurate tonight because so far Alabama is lined up and press across the board they feel confident they can match up with Mississippi State's personnel is going to be some tight windows here tonight last year they couldn't score when they got into bandit territory will tonight be different Fitzgerald on the roll bitch hands getting work tonight because of all the in breeze they have at the receiver position a jerk the dump this might be an opportunity on second and short not only is it likely fourdown territory but if I'm Mississippi State I might try to hit a playaction shot down the field no one I can come back and get it potentially on third down and remember it was open on the very first play at Fitzgerald just overshot the receiver little option here on 2nd and 2 and the pitch to Williams and he's going to get shut down Anthony Everett coming up the norm support it'll be third and 2 for Mississippi State on the 36 yard line tell you Gregg getting 32 for this offense so that's a dream they've got to be in third and short all night long to have a chance in this Drive they've had third and less than one third and two here that's that's the recipe for Mississippi State and Tom Dan Mullins not pulling any punches you got to think it's four down territory when you get to this part of the field they might have two downs to get it even if they're stopped short here now they got a walkon freshman kicker who hasn't missed this year but he also hasn't kicked on from this length they hand it off to Williams he is stopped the nose man with the head so it's 4th and 2 would be about a 54yard try again the kicker Jayce Crispin his long in the season is 45 the offensive staying on the field this is not even a thought to Dan Mullen as you said he's gone the crowd approves of the decision to potentially go for it and now they gotta calm down took the commo stick though guys it's too early why not Connick try to pin him deep this is Dan Mullins philosophy aggressive aggressive aggressive now Fitzgerald gets up under center maybe just talking to John Alabama outside and they're gonna take the penalty in Kannada I think this is the right call by dan mullen here in Alabama deep play defense and Williamson the referee you've already flipped the field now you're just hoping that your punter Logan cook can do his job senior kickers got a lot of experience but look on the season zero punts inside the 20 saving marks is the deep man Alabama had a leaping penalty trying to block a punt earlier on this Drive and you seen her they wanted to try beautifully done Mississippi State all over that great punt and Chris Rayford is down there for the Bulldog ESPN college football is presented by hem tin by Hilton welcome back to college football on ESPN presented by Hampton by Hilton as part of veterans week on ESPN brought to you by USAA it's a final at Auburn 42:17 Georgia get the roll so there will be a new the college football playoff line we feel thanks from the 5yard line it hurts the quarterback Damien Harris in the backfield and it's going to be Harris good game on first down out to the ten for five yards hurts a true sophomore had maybe his best day as a quarterback against Mississippi State a year ago or touchdown passes and a rushing score there is again and this time he stepped up with the harvester that's got a yard it'll be third down for Bama the atmosphere into the field it's not quite as well as the other with the communication so difficult for Alabama for Mississippi State everybody standing up to the line of scrimmage sack fight GT gray forcing a fight John Grantham the defensive coordinator for the Bulldog ops to bring pressure off the lefthand side and you see gray to slip right around the left guard Pierce Bakker wrapping up Jalen hurts in the backfield huge play in this Bulldog defense JK Scott at the back of the end zone the punt this is his 54th game at Alabama he's been a situation before gets off an excellent kick in a deck Thomas fair catching it falling down he's their fifth string punt returner they've been so many injuries at that position Mississippi State's defense gets a stop and forces a pun ESPN college football is presented by Hampton by Hilton book a room today and follow your team all the way and in part by Kia hurry enduring Kia's light up the holiday sales event offers an su Mississippi State quarterback Nick Fitzgerald from a military family his father Darren boy spoke to this week said he served as an air traffic controller basically in the Air Force for 20 years it was born in Germany moved to Florida at the age of 1 after retiring his father became Nick's football coaches Fitzgerald Jordans ominous dan wants to take advantage of six foot five a prett a corner Jeromy Pruitt the defensive coordinator for Alabama was concerned about the ability that Thomas had and he felt as though if he got in oneonone situations against these corners that would not be good for the Crimson Tide so a second time already Mississippi State has been in Alabama territory fits Cherokee thing it here turning it up inside to the 28 yard line by the yard line for Fitzgerald is a big dude sixfive 230 thread you talk about that matchup on the outside and Dan Mullen talked about having those opportunities it's at a weakened formation um I can get the oneonone that I want but now we've got it executed and in that particular instance they executed it perfectly which sets up the next one down with your best runner in the ball in his hands who's well covered just almost impossible to stop a well thrown back shoulder tom on second and five it's a oneplay Williams pushing the pile near the Raekwon Davis office top third down and one we saw this on the last Drive where they get third and short now they're in field goal range see if that offensive line can lean on Alabama's defensive line which is awfully hard to do but Binney group can it's this one last time on third down and short they didn't run Fitzgerald they tried to get it to one of their running backs in short yardage he got a guy that sixfootfive 230 pounds run the big fella and see if you can get some surge between the tackles or perimeter perimeter instead it's held straight ahead bouncing off the temple inside the 15yard line challenge the teeth of the Alabama defense deep wholesome number 42 filling in for the injured Zhang Jian Hamilton he's there he just doesn't make the tackle great job by Fitzgerald spinning off the wouldbe tackler and falling forward for a big first down Greg d\u00fanedain take a look at how long Mississippi State is taking in the huddle just simple to say low in this game down yeah just gonna say that leaves you've got ten and a half minutes gone by bamas had the ball for three plays they handled all Peter Williams make it thrilled at the 11yard line by Davis again and of two and three four eras Williams you're gonna hear that name a lot Raekwon Davis number 99 only a sophomore he might be the bestlooking defensive lineman in the country he's six foot seven and I think that's a little short frankly he's every bit a six seven the hook maybe six eight three ten and so versatile and athletic very long there in the trenches been very active early in this guy second and seven Williams again it all started with the penalty on Alabama for leaping that kept the first drive alive for Mississippi State which gave them good position rales Mississippi State for the first time in a game since 2008 Williams with a rushing score at a dog strike first welcome back to college football on ESPN presented by Hampton by Hilton as part of veterans week on ESPN brought to you by USAA eres Williams with his third rushing touchdown it's the first first quarter rushing touchdown given up by Alabama in the last 21 games remarkable Diggs and rugs are deep for Alabama but this will go through the end zone the touch back as we check in with Edmund Burke in the studio all right Dave Pasch thank you very much rocket Moore who's playing with confidence update opportu and George the deep south oldest rivalry and what a performance Auburn put on Jared see them to carry on Johnson here before today the number one team in the playoff era had lost four times by a toll at 21 points georgia loses by 23 to over one a game and then check this on Alabama coming into tonight trailing for only two minutes and 26 seconds and they're down late first quarter the Mississippi State not much there for star bro on furnish down on only a yard want to go back to the touchdown Alabama was so good up front that you have to create opportunities with leverage by looping pullers around look at 51 Stewart Reese a great job getting to Holcomb and allowing the touchdown fill one here a second down the 30yard line picks up four luis on the stop it'll be third down and again look at that D line for Mississippi State everybody staying I can push it expands pulled in for a first down Ridley wideopen he mix in a fender missin still going wiggling past the 40yard line weirdly to the 10 Alvin Ridley the best player on offense for Alabama left why toka all because of the protection up club Mississippi State opting for blitz which leaves their secondary and isolation someone you he's going to make for the person I'm 64 the sixyard the leftside stiffarming lunging and they mark him down at the oneyard line great effort by Hertz looks like that left knee was down so I think it about correct but tremendous effort by the sophomore at 240 pounds that experience joined it and purged out of bounds but he got in touch down on Alabama eight rushing touchdown this season for Jalen Hurd's who just beat the defender to the corner so much green grass to the field her Jalen hurts and it's a footrace him and Brandon Bryant to the pylon Jalen Hertz wins it what an answer by Alabama's offense then we showed that graphic about trailing for two minutes and 26 seconds all season they trailed for a minute 54 before scoring a touchdown and then tying it with a point after take off your week 10 NFL Sunday with a countdown crew at 10 a.m. Eastern on ESPN also streaming live on the ESPN app and our Monday night football matchup this week the 4 and 4 Dolphins against Cam Newton and the 6 and 3 Panthers Monday night countdown kicks off our coverage at 6:00 Eastern on ESPN 16:39 bass player Ridley setting up to jail and Hurst touchdown run for unbeatens left in college football with George and losing tonight Alabama Wisconsin Miami spending noted and shortly an ABC and you see a short kickball field it at the ten yard line by time out to the twenty seven want to go back to the last drive and looked at that long pass play by Alabama Mississippi State opting to bring pressure off the righthand side this is called a trap to you see those two safeties deep and the corners underneath nothing but wide open space over the middle of the field and that's exactly where Calvin Ridley got to tremendous job up front by Alabama's offensive line picking up that pressure and giving Jalen Hertz a couple seconds to find Ridley streaking then of course Ridley making it happen after the catch that was Mark Maclaurin that missed the tackle which led to the big one after the catch from the Mississippi State 27 yard line put a mixup Fitzgerald colliding with Highland Hills and Fitzgerald keeping it for three yards Mississippi State beat LSU big at home earlier this season but the games where they played top 10 teams this year they have not fared well they lost 49 10 at Auburn 31 3 at Georgia much better start tonight against Alabama quick throw by Fitzgerald to the true freshman he'll slam down at the 32 yard line by Levi Wallace gain of a couple third down coming up your jaw by Levi Wallace they're shedding the blocker and making what could have been a decent gain a very short one and setting up a third and a little bit more difficult than the third and twos they've seen to this point Greg that's where I think Alabama's so good on defense they're difficult to block and then they tackle in space tackling in today's offensive game the football is so difficult that you got to limit those leaked yards after the balls been caught Fitzgerald on third and four with time broken up incomplete Minka Fitzpatrick Oh Gladys thrown Fitzpatrick look like he made a good play on the football maybe he got the receiver with the left hand as he was knocking the ball away with his right following his nails on the receiver that was sick Budi Jones that's the second big penalty by Alabama that's led to a Mississippi State first down you can see them right here Hootie Jones on the righthand side he grabs that caller that's a great call by the official easy call are you surprised great and how much Mississippi State is huddling trying to shorten the game I'm not surprised at all the more plays you play against Alabama the more difficult it becomes I'd take your chances when you can from the 42 yard line big hit in the backfield the helmet comes off as Fitzpatrick makes the tackle he's gonna have to come out for a play tackles Kyle and Hill but because he lost his lid he's got to sit out for a play see if Mississippi State tries to snap it here doesn't look like it will only go to the second quarter with a game tied at 7 touchdown run by eres Williams and a touchdown run by Jalen Hertz for Alabama number 16 Mississippi State setting secondranked Allen you're watching the SEC on ESPN and when you are born in Starkville you are born with a cowbell in hand everybody's got him here at Davis Wade stadium the things loving it's awesome so Minka Fitzpatrick out to this play because he lost his helmet Mississippi State on second and ten kilowatt hours magnums are the touchdown earlier and he gets a first down here the third time already Mississippi State has been in Alabama territory the good job of misdirection look at how he starts to his right then comes back around to his left and follows big 61 Deon Calhoun through the left hand side nice counter action Alabama is so aggressive and so good and versatile up front you need to get their big guys running in one direction and then come back the other way misdirection is imperative for Mississippi State to try to create opportunities on the ground eris williams gained 10 pounds from last year got a lot stronger it's on a run between the tackles picking all here moving the pile a little bit but Isaiah plunks pushes him back gained a free boil and then he'll take that rung on the football between the tackles against Alabama positive yardage against this defenses of Plus now can't gain three on every down obviously and get the first naturally mathematics Alabama so far you've seen them have a couple issues at the second level with their linebackers Holcomb in particular missed a couple tackles now Holcomb not on the field and his number 18 Dylan Moses the freshman in the middle of the field Williams again and this time brought down after a gain of about 1 by Anfernee Jennings you mentioned the linebackers talked about it in the open with Matt Wilson and Sean D on Hamilton out for the season Paul cone comes back in this is his first SEC start four linebackers out for Alabama and Alabama is about the only team in college football that could handle this type of devastation at the linebacker level they've recruited so well at every position but it's no denying that the most important part of their defense is the second level and they're missing some key players tonight third and seven for Mississippi State from the 43 yard line Fitzpatrick tours to the sidelines it's packed and fighting for the first down as Justin Johnson as he's able to break a tackle they move the sticks 6:3 247 pounds tougher defensive back to bring down Johnson just drag that's all effort I mean a Brits trying to get there I'm Tony Browns in a good spot he's just giving up 50 pounds almost to Johnson it's tough to drag him down when he has forward momentum tremendous job by Justin Johnson from Birmingham you got to think he's got a little left in the tank knowing that he's playing against his home state school oh yeah these two schools separated by only about 90 miles they're gonna run Williams again in trouble in the backfield dragged down loss of one big Quintin Williams and talked about the athletic ability some of these guys was watching him return punts and warmish how does it feel Quintin Williams at 290 and Tom you you recruit you know recruiting as well as anybody try to put into perspective just how good this front seven is from a recruiting standpoint at a depth standpoint well let's see I'm counting right now how many stars the stars one hold on I'm counting them one two three eight eight Under Armor all Americans are on the field right now for Alabama on defense some of those guys are backups including the Brian Roy a true freshman who's in Williams off the left side inside the 30 in short for the Bulldog a great run right there and a good job up front on this big offensive line they found something that they like on this left side they've used some pullers they've used some rappers dan mullen knows that the left side of his offensive line is outstanding and they've leaned on those big guys up front for a majority of this first half expect him to lean on that left side again right here on third and short Fitzgerald fakes now just releasing vertical off the playaction Harrison is looking in the backfield he's a half second late to turn upfield and the results in a big completion first and goal how about Eris Williams 14 carries already 460 yards we mentioned her to blowout losses this year he struggled in those games so he got more yards in this one than he had in those two losses mr. Fong is good at 147 but they had to establish the line of scrimmage he challenged his offensive line if they've responded just another day in the park mr. mowett the ESPN F is a fans best friend that arch knew frankly every espn/abc college football game is streaming live access to scores download the ESPN f to start streaming now so watching games upset already tonight Georgia going down Alabama trailing by seven look at the rushing yards of the Mississippi state Alabama only gives up since 76 rushing yards per game he picked off by foot little Kumasi the 25 we're talking with Dan Mullen yesterday and remember they had a losing season last year so his name wasn't out there a whole lot but it is now and he said look I've been here for nine years people just assume that I want another job that I love it here now I'm sure there are jobs out there he would look at if offered but he said this is a place he loves and obviously he's built this thing up he has and he's built it in his image it's a tough bluecollar football team that really responds to the challenges that he provides what a job he's done in Starkville it's obvious why everyone thinks is one of the best coaches around for Hertz and it dumped it off two inches the tight end out near the 34 and a thing with Mullen is who you work for admire with him at Utah with him at Florida his development of quarterbacks something that probably doesn't get talked about enough and identifying talent too he knows what to look for from the fans of the standpoint at second and short they run Josh Jacobsen he's able to get the first out of the 38yard long you know guys this is the first series that Alabama has been backed up in the closed end of this steel and it is getting loud and they've done a nice job of moving away from the south the line of scrimmage was there first and then Cory Thomas who's been out with a foot injury cleaned of all this the last three games put us back tonight second and ten for Alabama time to throw for her climb in the pocket but everybody covered so he takes off there's it pushed out of bounds at the one that's twice Mississippi State has forgotten about the best player on the field for Alabama I love that this part of Jalen hurts his game is really starting to come al last year here to take it off in the run now eyes are downfield he identifies an open receiver that limits it very accurately on the run but first in gold Jacobs into the endzone touchdown Alabama 61 yard pass play to Ridley sets up the oneyard score by Jacobs so much poise for this Alabama offense as soon as they get hit they counterpunch hit counter punch and they did so with a big play in the passing game by their quarterback and their outstanding threeyear starter at wide receiver Calvin Ridley this remarkable owe that twice Mississippi State has lost Ridley leading two touchdowns for Alabama as we are tied at 14 ESPN college football brought to you by Allstate official protector of college football fans and nisa premier partner of the Heisman Trophy so Alabama's trailed twice tonight but for a total of only three minutes and 410 snaps 16 snaps all season long both touchdown setup by huge pass plays to Ridley on the go line is Reggie Todd hits when he goes but a flag if that's on Mississippi State I'll have to start from there 5yard line Brian Robinson huge hit block in the back turn to number 29 half the village we go first down huge penalty we'll start at the 5 huge penalty here you can see right in the middle right there and that's just in front of the referee and they're gonna call that every single time CJ Morgan's gotta understand that when that kickoff players cross his face he can't hit him in the back and put your here on their own five the first time first time grad we've seen the skilled positions flipped in Alabama's favor it's to keeping it able to get outside get the first down shooting out of five twelve yard run for Fitzgerald they had numbers on that right side Fitzgerald coming in to try with over 800 rushing yards the 13 career games where he's rushed for a hundred yards that is a record for an SEC quarterback he is a very Airy in the passing game every week they go into here on first after the 17 Gerald Thomas had it but just couldn't hang on it would have been a gain of about 30 at least man huge play potentially Thomas just can't reel it in he knew the hit was coming it just slips right out of his grasp just a terrific throw Greg from fish jail this is the most accurate I've seen him all year long no doubt Tom and you see big Jordan Thomas going to the sideline the Bulldogs need him on the field that's been a very good matchup to them so far second and ten fitzgerald running in trouble and slammed down with Sean Evans two tackles for a loss tonight for Evans we talked about the guys they don't have it linebacker but as long as Evans is on the field they're okay they got him that's a big deal for Sean Evans just another in a long line of outstanding linebackers for Alabama Thomas still shaken up on the sideline very difficult third down here for Mississippi State Alabama so good in coverage and terrific rushing the passer averaging almost five sacks a game the last four games this is a V state doesn't give up sex though only six on the year but one tonight play clock winding down it's a 2/3 and 13 and Fitzgerald just a quarterback draw and he's out to the 20 so that's just to get some yardage and give their punter some more room hopefully help themselves a field position and a few missed opportunities for Mississippi State so far the first play of the game they try to go deep Nick Fitzgerald overthrows it he's made some great plays between then and now and made a great one too when he threw it to Thomas Thomas drops it he can't make mistakes like that against Alabama because they're going to get it back now with tremendous field position 10 punts this season for Cooke have gone more than 50 yards Mississippi State could use one of those right here and it is an excellent they flip the field with a 62yard punt and a near giveaway bump punt by marks but able to jump on it it's number one versus number two number four versus number five one night two blockbuster matches and the college football playoff rankings will be announced from those games will Alabama be number one Georgia law so there will be a new number one but Bama right now tied with Mississippi State first out of the 18 yard line they run Harris and he gets three to the 21yard line new offensive coordinator this year at Alabama with Brian De Ville taking over 17 seasons in the National Football League he goes back with Nick Saban to Michigan State he was a ga there when saving was the head coach of the Spartans good job he's done in seven hurts to the air again has being chased and throwing it out of bounds by a hit Jerry shooting no Greg I I'm okay with that right there you don't make a dumb play with the football back duck but what his ability to work through progressions dick within the structure the going to have to do is communicate news Frank top third he was outstanding on third down last weekend it continued here tonight really good job Hertz improving his game as a passer third Dan that shoulder to Wrigley and it's incomplete really well covered and land it out of bounds I thought he stepped out of bounds first and didn't preestablished anyway they review every play I think Nick Saban wants to take a longer look at it yeah I wonder boy goes snail it wasn't a complete pass the previous play is under review did the foot touch before his backside hit not about right but look he's out of bounds there does he reassured like he reestablishes himself it doesn't look like it to me so close of course on these reviews there has to be indisputable video evidence beyond all doubt to overturn right there it's so close it's so bangbang it's difficult to assume that they're gonna overturn this one again it looked like he was out of bounds and he went out on his own to begin with wasn't pushed out initially so he shouldn't be eligible to even catch them I think that's gonna be the question here guys because if you look at the actual reception he secured the ball with his left foot inbounds they're trying to see if he established himself I'm sure but the letter of the law I don't think he did which would result in illegal touching here but again he went out on his own went out on his own was not forced out a lot to consider here for the replay officials and those back in Birmingham at the SEC office this shift stain it would be four down but even on that play there you see the growth of hertz and the work that david who's done with him right yeah and then obviously the rapport that he started to develop with Calvin Ridley that's tight coverage well covered well thrown good job by Mississippi State but sometimes a better throw beats that good coverage but it looks as though they ran out of room there on the boundary for Alabama so again they're looking to see if he went out on his own first or was he pushed out to clear presents the ball was in Venice morning if you're pushed out by the defender you can reestablish but he was not there for you can't a lot of bounds on your own and then be the first guy to touch the football so it is an incompletion for town yeah that's a good job by the officials Calvin Ridley is having a chat with them trying to understand what just happened hang on saying I caught it fit fix it now the decision has been made and I think it was a good one Dedrick thomas is back JK scott had a killer punt the first time in thomas had trouble with it he also has a punt return for a touchdown this year that was last week this is not a good kick by Scott but it takes a couple of Alabama Hawks Thomas picked it up and got leveled right as he grabbed it by a Holcomb and Mississippi State will start at its 30yard line midway through the second quarter all even Allstate is proud to be part of the team that comes together to do good by contributing to participating universities general scholarship funds for each field goal an extra point kick the date allstate has contributed millions in scholarship funds welcome back to college football and ESPN presented by Hampton by Hilton as part of Veterans week on ESPN brought to you by USA a Alabama ranked number two Mississippi State number 16 or tied at 14 packed house here in Starkville Mississippi State back on offense on its 30yard line through freshmen Thailand Nick Fitzgerald a quarterback he'll finds a hole and is able to get up to the 34 for a four yard run this is pretty darn good company for Nick Fitzgerald yeah it really is and it's in really good company too when the first words that come out of Nick Saban's mouth when you ask him to compare Nick Fitzgerald to a particular player that he schemed against first guy he said Tim Tebow yeah and then the second guy that Tom said was Matt Jones at Arkansas I think he's very closely resembles Matt Jones with how big his stride is and how much ground he can cover when he takes off with the football on second and six Fitzgerald peeping it and he's close to the first on the market guys what about the differences between him and dak Prescott and how the run game is with Fitz Jericho paired to what it used to be with that dak is a little shifty er a little bit better side to side Fitzgerald is more explosive when it comes to running north and south of course he's a little bit taller as well just a couple inches though so they're very similar with what they tried to do with Fitzgerald and dak but dak is a little bit better running between the tackles where most of Fitzgerald's big plays come outside on the perimeter the huge third one here for Mississippi State from Columbus Mississippi this is about 20 minutes from Davis Wade stadium move the change is a big recruit Dave a fourstar guy in state and this is a pretty deep stable of running backs so for Kyle and Hill to be able to get some turns on critical downs like a third down there that tells you how far this program has come under Dan Mullen in the caliber of athlete now that's coming to Starkville and they use Kyle and Hill in so many different ways his ability to process everything they're throwing at him is a true freshman it's pretty remarkable magnetic Adair is Williams a break he's got 14 carries all editing in this game he'll again this time Alabama's defensive line was better Quintin Williams is there for the tide from an offensive standpoint fellas I don't know if this game could have gone anymore better than it had than it could be because here's the deal you slow down the game now a sudden you keep Alabama's offense on the sideline you're frustrating them and you've got balanced run to pass which I don't even think Mississippi State coming into the game thought they'd be able to run the football the way they have here tonight in the first half and the time of possession numbers are just staggering Mississippi State dominating in that regard over 20 minutes now with the football Fitzgerald drumming the ball here wrapped up by Kieran Payne was there first on the 44 yard line third down and long here Mississippi State nearly three minutes to go in the first half you just have to stay out of these situations if you're Mississippi State coming into this game on 3rd and 8th plus situations it's exactly what this is they convert only 17 and a half percent that's 104th in college football they have to be more efficient on first and second down because trying to gain big chunks against this defense and third down is almost impossible Rush's five and a deep from the hands at the antenna receiver Reggie Todd but Tony Brown jumped in front that may have distracted the receiver it's fourth down that was hot the way the ball was flying looks like Brown almost touched it or he did touch it with that left hand and Todd he was all alone on the sidelines as he threw on the depth chart come into the season but now of course forced in the action just miss plated in the air look like a little bit it was really hard to tell if Brown got a finger on her another missed opportunity on a deep ball though for Mississippi State Marc's gonna let this one with the golf swing there he had some backspin on that baby all right Dave thank you coming up from the mercedesbenz halftime report Georgia number one team in the country losing to Auburn what does that mean app the playoff Catholics versus convicts Miami Notre Dame 2017 update there and of course well the biggest but games the year in the big 12 t soon Oklahoma Joey Galloway Jesse Palmer me coming up Dave back to you Dan thank you let's see how Alabama handles does first down from it's 2 yard line because starving it hurts in the pistol start going straight ahead to the floor and a few yard run Vick Jeffrey Simmons in the nose and a little pushing and shoving afterwards it's always difficult to be backed up on the road it's especially difficult to be backed up with your back to the student section from Mississippi State and to hear those cowbells go swing up very difficult to communicate in this part of the field you speak from experience I've been there it wasn't built out the way it is now it's a tough spot on the field to be for Alabama's where it's changing things up here Hertz running a star both laughing apart what sir Adam there is a penalty marker down on the far side of the field at the 5yard line dan mullen was going to call timeout but because of a double burger he came from the 44 big mistake by Cory Thomas Mullin was going to call timeout but not now so 7 3 and the 9 yard line it's Harris breaks a tackle stumbles just short of the line to gain Arras showing some power there it's 31 besides judge the referee of the timeout being called and he couldn't get its attention that's how loud it is on that side of the field tongue yeah there's no doubt about it you talk to the Alabama coaches you look at the quarterback Jalen Hurd teased back here they've got to communicate with all this noise all these cowbells behind us here and it starts getting cranked up so it takes the verbal communication out of the equation so we're gonna watch you and when you see teams in the shotgun from speaking and they've gone to the Handclap with generally pierces the noise but it's very difficult to do now that this stadium is enclosed in this end zone let's see how this play goes let's see if my Hey can hear at 14 to go we're to design here today gets the first day out to the 18 yard line I actually heard it a little bit there here is because it quieted the crowd a little bit with that first down we get to clunker take first out of the 17 Hertz to the air climbing the pocket delivering a strike cam Sims on the catch out to the 35 and let's see now if Alabama uses a timeout walk will start on the ready for play as they reset the chain bird setting up and it's better down Marquis Spencer here to be the one to get a hand on it second and 10 if in mind the field goal kicker for Alabama Andy pop Anastas long in the season is 46 yards which means they need to get it down around the 28 yard line movement by Alabama met Rome at the right tackle first your starter Smith to the penalty here comes the crowd fellas Ross Pierce Baker has not returned since angry to the air escaping the pocket and stopping the clock by scooting out of I'm forced out by Spencer and if they don't get it you would imagine that bring it on all soon way covered feel good about where you're at if your top Grantham and a guarantee all the players are saying cut the number three cuz he's the guy had lost place for their place it's a quarterback too long and hurts out to the 40 Dan Mullen should call it timeout here on fourth down and he does with 32 seconds to go so they'll have one timeout when they get the ball back but you also have an excellent putter and Jake hey Scott Nick Saban was trying to call timeout both INEC dan mullen beat him to it why wouldn't it save him call it team was rollin Elam he went out to the field and was given the timeout signal surprise it exceeded would call a timeout unless gotta go for a fourth and five from your own 40 but that's what making us no I don't think that's what he was thinking I don't know if there was a a miscommunication there's something but I applaud Dan Mullen forgetting the timeout down here because since 2014 Mississippi State is one of the best teams in college football when it comes to blocking kiss big blocks one already this year for a touchdown so expect him to come after it here be aggressive and see if they can't get a hand on it all right we all thought that maybe Alabama was vulnerable because of the injuries at linebacker but you surprised by what you've seen so far this game I'm not their offenses played very well right that a few big plays they've been relatively methodical the one thing that I've seen though is their defense they've actually gotten pushed around a little bit at the point of the tackle they've also given up their fair share of explosive plays through the air and the couple missed opportunities to for Mississippi State I think both teams will go to half feeling about where they're at and saying hey we control the next 30 minutes we're gonna win the football game look at this Mississippi State has nobody back they're just gonna let Scott Conant and it's not a very good kick that bags around the 30yard line doc the Mississippi State didn't want to come after that I wonder Gregg when they saw saving coming onto the field were they worried about a fakin so they said you know it was just be safety or not put a return Mandeep went with the actual defense on the field I mean they were lined up in the simple quarters coverage can't say that I've seen that especially when you've been opportunistic in the kicking game over the course of the last few years well it's interesting sitting and go for the block and now they're not gonna go for yardage they're just taking a knee here that doesn't surprise me we're on your own 28 yard line make it to half don't let anything catastrophic captain feel good about where you're at at 14 apiece Georgia number two Alabama lose tonight in Starkville tied at halftime you're watching veterans week coverage on ESPN brought to you by USAA welcome back to college football on ESPN presented by Hampton by Hilton you're watching the SEC on ESPN number two Alabama and number 16 business apiece day even at 14 apiece as we get ready for the third quarter at the Craig McElroy M Dave Pasch Tom luginbill in the minute and Greg the story of this game is Mississippi State not letting Alabama's offense on the field Bama was out there for eight minutes the reason this game is tie because of the big boys yeah it's because Mississippi State saw a tremendous job controlling the line of scrimmage it's rare to see Alabama on the field for as much time as they were because they forced so many three announced that Mississippi State's commitment to the run game and a success that they've had doing it and I think that's something that Jeremy drew at the defensive coordinator for Alabama has to try to get a dress because Mississippi State did a tremendous job being the follicle throughout the port for the first 30 minutes 23 first half plays and they will start the second half on their 25yard line let's take a look at the Allstate All Hands in play Calvin Ridley has been a star tonight much like he has over force of his career big play in the passing game and right here in the scramble drill uncovered puts the mailbox signup race that right hand a tremendous throw by Jaylon Hearst the fencing game tonight has been outstanding in large part due to what Calvin Ridley has done in uncovering and make stamp right there is what we've seen in here as a young Jacobs on jet sweep here in the first play MIT ball is forward for a first down to the 37 yard line but you look at Ridley coming into the game 44 catches the rest of the team has right around 44 Simmons and sweat continue to push Alabama offensive lineman Ridley is explosive a wide receiver as you'll see not as big as a Mary Cooper not as big as Julio Jones but very quick and really good with the ball on his hand under two heads live in Texas in Alabama behind the bar a Cooper Burks to the air short pass to Jacobs and Jacobs hit with a stiff arm and it jacobs lowers the shoulder to the 44yard line gain of seven the fellows it's not too surprising dan mullen pretty pleased with the performance of his team in the first half but the one area he said they've got to do a better job in is not missing opportunities for explosive plays you remember the drop ball down the sideline with Thomas there in the second quarter they can't allow that to happen again if they want to win tonight they fake the jet sweep and let Harris fake finally down to the 10yard line Brandon Bryant tackles Harris and Bryant shaken up on the play Harris has been so good this season they hit the Jets we from the they take the jet sweet bear gets out the gate poor job at the second level by Maclaurin number 41 the safe he's sliding in there Paris great job bursting for a huge play he's been as reliable as any of the tremendous backs that alabama's had this year brian is hurt Maclaurin missed attack on a Calvin Ridley pass in the first half and does so here as well welcome back to college football and ESPN presented by Hampton by Hilton as part of Veterans week on ESPN brought to you by USAA tied at 14 early thurb at Alabama's got a first and goal at the Mississippi State 9 yard line Expedia reminds you we are here at Davis Wade stadium in Starkville matchup between Mississippi State and Alabama Crimson Tide if they win tonight they'll be number one in the college football playoff rankings he would imagine on Tuesday with Georgia losing big at Auburn meanwhile Brandon Bryant shaken up for Mississippi State on the tackle of Damien Harris he's been through so much his dad was killed in a motorcycle accident two years ago he thought about quitting football came back to play for Mississippi State and has played so well for them the last couple years threeyear starter that'd be a big loss great effort by him too chasing down Damien Harris they can see that hope he's okay his replacement is Jonathan Abram who did not play with because of a targeting call last week they weren't suspended for the first half of this week's game purchase head of the backfield and brought that's a huge play for Mississippi State Maclaurin was back there along with Adams just pressure coming off the lefthand side and the righthand side out of the flat to Wrigley bailando cleveland date of one it's going to be third and goal from the 12 yard line big to play sequence for Mississippi State after giving up the long run to Damien Harris the tackles for loss goal from the 12 the drain a chance to regroup Alabama has not as train twice daily goal hurts Enzo attendances Judy did not come up with it here comes the field goal team that's a massive stop Mississippi State's defense to high safeties trying to get that post route out of the slots of duty and really the first errant pass we've seen from Jaylin hurts tonight he has been in such great demand that one coming out of his funky taking a nosedive like a sinker that a pitcher throws off the mountain hasta sound for a 30yard field goal try to get Alabama please 17:14 the tide in front ESPN college football brought to you by Koch Industries challenge accepted and Chevy the

of the final four Mississippi State ended up losing to South Carolina the championship game but their final four banner was raised last night Morgan her teammates coach Mitch shame for getting their rings tonight and what myself I was like dad ratchet anima to pass the 20 and all the way to the 32 yard line nice return as we go to the studio in Edmund Burke well they passed the AT&amp;T field pass let's get you up to date what's going on first with big 12 action TCU and Oklahoma a huge game here Baker Mayfield the Greg Cal Cantera TCU known for that great defense but so far already get up 17 points and it's early in the second also Notre Dame Miami on ABC look at Malik Rozier on the keeper right now it is all hurricanes 14 nothing only in a second Dave Wow imagine if number one and number three go down and again number two only as a three point lead from the Mississippi State 31 Fitzgerald keeping and a nice run a lot for it was an outstanding game plan coming in tonight for Mississippi State trying to establish the line of scrimmage stick to the lefthand side because it sets up plays like this they fake that same run action to the left and they hit green on the seam route in the red zone it's been a nice mix of run pass but the amount of success they've had on the ground has really opened up their offense for Dan Mullen that eres Williams of the backfield with him Williams at 14 carries 60 yards in the first half Fitzgerald peaking here trying to get outside as the first Irish on Evan it is hard to outrun for Sean Evans and Fitzgerald just did it I was thinking the same thing you're breaking away from Rashad Evans he's one of the fastest most disruptive linebackers in the game clearly his speed is on display it's not often you see an Alabama defender beaten to the perimeter especially by a quarterback it just goes to show you just how capable Fitzgerald is with the ball in his hands again Fitzgerald pitching it to Williams in midfield again it's Evans on the stop but excellent yardage on first down that's a gain of six but they're staying out of obvious passing downs by winning on first and second down now and second and short then Greg to your point if you can run the football like this and you decide to just sit in the huddle for a good 30 seconds it's going to frustrate the defense that's used to dictating turn it keeps Jalen Hurd sitting on a bench more than four yards per play on first down four and a half here second and four at midfield it's a great play call Alabama goes with a little fire zone off the lefthand side which vacates that area and Gibson reels it in probably makes it a little harder than he had to but verse forward really good play called timely play called air by this Mississippi State offense Gipson gonna stand for first down at the 41 of Alabama Ivan it's gone by in the quarter Gibson and running right and again look at the yard again you just don't normally see Alabama's defensive line leaving at this point in the first half it's not about the linebackers it's the D line yeah you don't ever see Alabama's defensive line being driven back it's rare but to see this offensive line and this is the best offensive line that Alabama has seen at any point this season this group is tough they're big they're extremely physical and they really play with the chip on their shoulder this is a tremendous challenge for Alabama and so far Mississippi State's been up to the task second and six on a 37 of Alabama Fitzgerald to throw Dinkins defense which they've been frustrated but how they passed this off and you can see who d jones he actually releases upfield turns inside and runs vertical which allows the wide route to take place if who d jones would have stuck with that running back from the beginning of the play the would have had a much less much smaller chance of getting positive yardage instead it's first in ten right on the fringe of the red zone alabama only gives up ten points per game they've allowed 14 so far Mississippi State gone four more as that passes it's picked off I thought it was intercepted by Holcomb they will get incomplete but I think it may have stayed off the ground there it did but as Jamie Mosley was going to the field and sliding down you'll see the ball just trickle out of his grasp look at this but does it ever hit the crime does right there yep it did you're right but my goodness I mean that ball was thrown a million miles an hour to see how quickly it bounced back on the recoil and Moses unable to bring it in fortunate play there from Mississippi State on 2nd and 10 another pass by Fitzgerald kids Nick and is incomplete fitzpatrick got to Fitzgerald its third down to ten just right around the right edge you can see Fitzpatrick what a one against a running back Harris Williams whose solid in protection but Fitzpatrick is just so elusive came into the night a little concerned about his hamstring would he be full go would he be limited would they try to take advantage of him and clearly that right hamstring not an issue after last week the interested to see what they call they just run the ball trying to get more yardage to make it an easy kick nope Fitzgerald to get the first pitch gates fearless Fitzgerald when he escapes the pocket he's looking the throat it's not often that he escapes the pocket and keeps the football right there he sees that he's got a blocker out in front in the full head of steam and he knows he can get the yardage as clearly Nick Saban is displeased with what his defense is putting out there giving up 1/3 insanity with this defense go first down on the 15yard line Fitzgerald keeping drop that beats 12 by durante 3 art pickup down the way through the third quarter threepoint family congrat dragged a gonna talk with Nick Saban right before we went to happen he listed all the things we don't have the ball we had poor field position and we couldn't get off the field on third down I think that's the most demoralizing thing to a defense that is so used to dominating on first and second down and then they get behind the change and they have such an advantage they have not won at Mississippi State behind the chains here in this game certainly the second half all those injured linebackers for Alabama second and seven Williams already with two rushing touchdowns and see if they give it to him to try to get number three the quarterback keeps it and Fitzgerald hit by Jones heavy to Mississippi State looking to go back in front led twice in the first half 7 nothing and at 147 of will Dan Mullen call here a lot of options second and goal from the two I might try to get Nicki Fitzgerald out on the perimeter sprint him to the right and see if he can't find a receiver in the flat for half that potentially some green grass to the white side whose picture rolling the summit saved in there just a moment ago talking with defensive coordinator Jeremy Truitt probably wondering what happened our defense on that drive 13 plays 69 yards 6 minutes and 38 seconds and it's 21 17 Mississippi State in order to beat Alabama you have to have a superhuman performance from your quarterback Nick Fitzgerald tried to deliver and his coach loved it do it it takes Archer jeopardy have battles of KDF anyway Delta Jose that's to beat my first six Gerald after the touchdown feeling filled here to be vomiting on the sidelines the medical tent put his out and a deep kickoff and Alabama will started the 25 of her shoes that man thank you David AARP real possibilities studio update TCU in Oklahoma rocky Anderson 3 Street heard your games coming in at a 30 yard game and on the next play that 24 yard program the touchdown Sooners up 247 all over to see you Dave it'd be really interesting especially if Alabama goes down at the top three teams of the playoff rankings a great start for the teens at 14 nothing perched at the pier and the sense of hope the touchdown by Nick Fitzgerald he vomits on the sidelines we were looking at the replay trying to see if he got hit awkwardly in the helmet but didn't see that it they just went on 13 play drive it when the tent came out was back that is a true freshman he keeps on continuing sink an enchanted forest taken to 24 this is city state looks like it's coming so there first because of coordinator chop Grantham the pressure right middle and we could see in the floor and get in his hand on it jaelyn trying to get rid of it quickly on the quick slant it's not quick enough JK's sky to punt for Alabama from inside his 10yard line Dedrick thomas taken down right away there at the 36 yard line 17 correct take us back with our Buick Drive recap outstanding 13 play drive stay this right here on Nick Fitzgerald opting to keep it on the lefthandside picking up the needed yards and Fitzgerald calls his own for the touchdown all the momentum here midway through the third quarter they have dominated time of possession Alabama had the ball thrown the eight minutes in the first half Mississippi State holding the football here in the third quarter Fitzgerald turning it upfield oh man levels by deshaun hand ups to his feet though no game they've allowed three rushing touchdowns on defense the most under nick saban the last time it happened was what a freshman in high school right now I was actually a freshman in college and joke Pines was the interim coach that was the Independence Bowl and Joe pines famously said he got stopped inside track and that was exactly what he said that inside trap got us a couple times that night against the folks but good first down defense here with hand delivering the blow who Fitzgerald and off his Joe gotta run it again he's taken down at the 38 yard line he made the point on the last Drive of exhaustion perhaps of that 13th play driver and he's getting a lot of run here in the third quarter keeping it at the Senators it's not uncommon for him to half 15 20 25 carries he can handle that load he's that big of a body but with all the adrenaline and the emotion there's no doubt that I'm sure he's feeling a little bit he's taking some shots tonight too he has Gregg I'm watching him right now he's shaken is that a little bit and kind of loosening his neck after each and every play getting up kind of getting himself resituated you know we talked with him yesterday remember with dak Prescott we hear he was vibrant and this guy comes into a room and he stoic he tweet does not change emotion at all for a 10minute conversation can handle these moments 39 Jarrell's gotta throw it into some tight window I mean that looks great great separation that's an NFL drug that's the type of accuracy you have to display when you're trying to dissect Alabama through the air right on cue therefore Fitzgerald 22 yards and look what happens they go right back to the huddle take more time off the clock keep that Alabama offense on the sideline painful at times down they've been in Princeton tight territory eris Williams and Janee that of course the piledriving the defender that a 39yard giorgia lost earlier tonight the number one team the number three team Notre Dame is down 17 nothing in Miami right now and the number two team is trailing late third quarter and Starkville with Mississippi State trying to add to its fourpoint lead now the last time number one and number two lost on the same day you got to go back to 2012 I wonder when the last time number one two and three all went down might happen tonight so create a sport in the world never know what's going to happen on second and 7 of the run play a Williams again keeps the lakes rider get to the 30yard line for about three gonna bring up third down and for the Mississippi State the dread of really interesting play call here Tom third and five right tential four down territory albeit unlikely depending on how close they get to the sticks it'd be interesting to see if they run it or throw it here on third and manageable but there's so many options to Gregan and I don't think we can emphasize it enough how each and every one of these snaps that ball that the clocks going down inside 10 seconds and just frustrating Alabama 3 2 1 time of possession Mississippi State over Alabama if they get just past the 28 yard line if Fitzgerald will for by Wallace as tall as sit back inside trying to create some chaos with that bunch formation that's exactly what they got and picked up yet another big conversion through the air from the 11 yard line first and 10 Williams another player just waits till the fourth quarter Darryl Williams the left guard a little slow to get up the way this thing's got so far pretty sure they're not running any place we go to the fourth quarter you hold on before welcome back to the great see College Football on ESPN presented by Hanson by Hilton the SEC on ES Taco Bell a proud partner the college football be on the lookout for Taco Bell student

in fact it was January 1st 1966 so these were all folding the last time two top three lost on the same day Georgia lost earlier tonight Notre Dame down 17 nothing a huge third down and six can extend believe with a touchdown teakettle one score game Fitzgerald rolling out incomplete going for Jordan Thomas and then after the play pushing and shoving going on the officials have not thrown a flag yet the Mississippi State's gonna have to bring in the field oil team from our couch but Mississippi State was getting into it with a couple of Alabama players and he saw some of couches teammates go in there and rip him away from the fray big stop right there from Alabama that for Mississippi State has done a great job getting to this part of the field stalling there on a third and long but there's some bad blood in this rivalry there's no denying that you can see as evidenced by what happened after the play little chippy on the field Jase Fishman has not missed this season he's 8 of 8 on field goal talks 17 there is a penalty flag down at the 16yard line it's a fiveyear penalty it might make Dan Mullen running into the kicker be fair the fiveyard penalty still would have been fourth down the den Monsun yo we're taking the points we're not going to go for it on fourth and one so it's 24 17 this is a bee sting now you're watching that dari gene and Chris are watching this

on ESPN brought to you by USAA a fuel doll by Mississippi State going to keep it in one and running it out of the end zone as Henry loves a true freshman he gets a flop to the finger at the 17yard here in the second half FIFA support meter Todd Grantham is opted to bring a little bit more pressure with his defense they pin their ears back when they're rushing the passer this time only for the third bring him before and right there or in the a gap on the right hand side tip in the pass they've been very aggressive defensively the point of the game mentioned that winning streak of 30 straight regular season victories off the left side it's Jacobs and he gets good yardage about seven firstyear defensive coordinator Todd Grantham there was a Nick Saban protege coach Berman Michigan State excellent deport inator outstanding well respected as a Georgia for a Bentley over the last couple years here's Hertz taking out look at big guy Hertz and it looked at Hertz there the game on

team in the country down seven here in the fourth that's a good defense they're playing I'm at ECU for a big 12 team they have really good personnel on defense Baker Mayfield just continues to do things that just don't make sense he is he's spectacular the splenic all took long 2017 yes go to the Talmud possession alabama's had a parole of 13 minutes in this game and a timeout called by Mississippi State they have to burn one on defense the Bulldogs have the lead the Nick Saban's squad is on the move right now tipped off your week 10 NFL Sunday with the countdown crew at 10 a.m. Eastern on ESPN also streaming live on the ESPN app and then our week 10 monday night football matchup is a good one between the Dolphins at forest board and Newton's Panthers at 6:00 and free kick off at 8:15 a fastbreak macro whites ha pollutant villain Starkville Mississippi state hasn't beaten Alabama since Nick Saban's first year back in 2007 9 straight losses in the last two years he's gorgeous 9 nine points against Bama they got 24 tonight the tide is moving first in 10 on the Mississippi State 40 her taxes Morris McClure saying every time they brought him with pictures at Lawrence eight o'clock mark big Lauren coming off the edge with the safety pressure and Jalen Hertz knows it's coming just doesn't have anywhere to go runs into Josh Jacobs and he's dropped for a loss big play and great Paul by Todd Grantham trying to catch Alabama's offense lengthen its second and 15 here's Jacobs tourniquet appeal and stepped out around the 34 yard line so it gets a big chunk of it back 11 yards we drag let's see what gap sighs to attack this time de Ville the offensive coordinator this could be for down territory depending on what credits setting on and in the pass in the church in women complaining intended for Devon basement fourth and four it would be about a 52yard field goal try for path Anastas whose long as 46 to the offense will stay on the field the agreement that he sees you do today in Florida for control I don't I would funny Judy indicated they have none going for the snake hurts to throw got a whistle and Mississippi State called a timeout so that will lead the Bulldogs with just one had a bit of a substitution issue yeah you could see Grantham motioning to get off the field they had 12 guys right and the last time they took a timeout they were having a difficult time lining up and then follow it up with a sack so let's see what Branson dials up it here on for find out what's called part of the substitution foul one Mississippi State they've got guys out there that don't normally play it's fun because of all the injuries they've had on defense in this ball game you see Dez Harris Brandon Bryant two starters go down with injury I'm out off the board though guys defensively this thing's got a lot of time to go 11 minutes here in the fourth quarter that's to time that you can't afford to burn if you're Mississippi State all right let's focus you guys on on Alabama offense leaders we're going forward here and forth before what should we look for I think you have to get Jalen hurts out on the perimeter it'll simplify his read the problem with that is that the ball is on the right hash and he's a righthanded passer so in a perfect world you'd love to run him to the right but since the balls on the right hash he might be forced to run him to the Hertz stuffs up the neurons and as the first one down to the 21 smart place saw that everybody was covered and took off and picked up close to 15 yards huge play how many times over the course of the last two years have you seen Jalen Hurd's and take off on a critical down of distance to pick up the needed yardage with his feet so many times he's been able to create on his own right there it hasn't been a bigger play in the game always seems to make the right decisions Hertz to the left side toward the turf at the 40 but that's seven yards on first down Errol Thompson shaken up and he's in there for the injured Dez Harris they're gonna have to go third string here at linebacker we talked about all the linebacker for Alabama that are injured so it's a second down in three coming up for Alabama but while we have a moment we'll bring an adman from the studio thanks very much today just want to update you what's happening with regards to Notre Dame in Miami so Ian's book is implanted whimpers that's Trajan banding the pick6 donor named quarterbacks have five completions and three interceptions they are gonna get hammered on abc27 nothing right now at the half you is back Dave man and and then you think about it Manny had some close games where they barely won and we thought of going into Virginia Tech oh they're gonna get beat by the Hokies it didn't happen they won't rather easily and look what they're doing the Notre Dame in that offense they are so good at the line of scrimmage defensively in front seven I mean their linebackers as a unit there is good a group as I've seen in college football they are off the charts good with quarterman and McLeod Pinckney literally making life difficult for a Notre Dame offense that is majored in running the football not having a lot of success clearly tonight you saw errol thompson walk to the mississippi state locker room Dez Harris is back on the field so that's good news for Mississippi State again three ACL injuries he got four earlier the quarters what is that down to 73 player to drive it's been mostly young girls here comes pressure air is straight ahead first Peter the chance for the target time what a drive by Alabama 10 plays 82 yards tremendous poise an outstanding execution really impressive with Alabama's ability to weather the storm deal with the Edison flows and we talked about Jalen Hertz that's just a polite conduct number 70 the offense 15yard 1450 the game so you heard that Alex Leatherwood who is a backup offensive lineman that's out there committed a foul that will be enforced on the kickoff which could be big that's a huge bat just when you seize momentum can make a mistake like that don't see that very often from Alabama happen is the tide again splits the uprights third different Alabama player to score a rushing touchdown in this game 2424 Alabama trying to stay unbeaten and get to number one in the country eyes the game back up here in stark go Tuesday a lot going on on ESP and we got the State Farm champions classic from the United Center in Chicago at number one Duke taking a number two Michigan State at seven followed by five against four Kentucky Kansas at 9:30 we also have the release of the latest college football playoff rankings they won't be Georgia at this rate when the pivot on Alabama just tied the game 424 here at Stark but a penalty on Alex Leatherwood took his helmet off and when it celebrated with the team while he was into the game so they got him for penalty so Alabama is picking from the 20yard line it bounces at the 20 and here's Tom that's the 31st in the studio thanks very much Dave stopping heard this McCory rodney anderson doing big things for oklahoma he has over 200 yards from scrimmage and four touchdowns and that's in the first of the Sooners against that TCU deep at 38 14 a huge route in Norman also coming up next Jose Ramirez he's fighting for water rights for farmers in California and the super lightweightt rankings he certainly ranks high top ranked boxing coming up after your game day and who does win this game will end 942 to go and we're even and great starting field position for Mississippi State because of celebration penalty on a true freshman for Alabama on the sidelines talked about the poise of hurts Nick Fitzgerald's been pretty good in that department as well tonight Maris Williams getting the carry beautiful stutter step he just started forward a heartbeat six of eight yards they have really committed to trying to run the football and have had success particularly running behind their left tackle Martinez Rankin and their left guard Darrell Williams those two guys up front with Mississippi State gave out helmet stickers they'd each get a few of them after the performance that they've had against what is a stout and athletic defensive line group for Alabama Harris Williams closing in on a hundred yards go get it again on second and two and if kids does a great job of being patient picks up the first down one carries down for air as Williams he added in the offseason got a lot stronger and you can see it's paying off tonight Alabama just having a hard time Greg with their run fits in me what's easy to sit there and say the inexperience that linebackers playing a role and it may very well be but it's those guys in front of the linebackers that's been so surprising to see Mississippi state control the line of scrimmage you get movement when they've had 46 rushing attempts Tom had really tried to commit to delivering those body blows to Alabama's front first down in Alabama territory Williams getting the carry for a third straight play stumbles for about to the Greg think about how Mississippi State's started this game they came out throwing the football the first three downs Nick Fitzgerald got pummeled and then the play that changed things for them was the punt with the penalty and that gives them a fresh set of downs and Mississippi State goes right down the field Alabama's given up 171 rushing yards they allow on the season just 76 Fitzgerald will run this time and don't get much good job by Alabama thunder on pain so good at the point of attack third and long for Mississippi State Nick Fitzgerald has had a lot of success on third down the night Mississippi State 8 of 13 keeping drives alive and they've had a number of third down attempts that have been eight or more which is very difficult and not a down in distance that Mississippi State has had success with to this point of the season probably the biggest snap of the game at this point with the Bulldogs right now Fitzgerald will throw on third and eighth fires to the sidelines it's classic straighter line the game Thomas on the catch Fitzpatrick in coverage and you got four to the bomb three do you try to pin them deep or do you keep the offense on the field and go looks like they're gonna cut it and I agree with this their defense for the most part outside of that last Drive has been pretty solid the night and their punter he got to give him credit as well good he's dropped it inside the five a couple times and if you can pin Alabama deep on this side of the field with the student section right behind you that's advantage for the defense this one had kicked too hard a touchback it will come out to the 20 that's a huge mistake by the punter logan cook this week's college football rankings brought to you by Goodyear they're going to look a lot different next week at this rate with Miami trouncing Notre Dame Georgia getting hammered at Auburn Oklahoma dominating TCU the Wisconsin Badgers who you said on Tuesday if they went out they're gonna be in the college football playoffs they stay unbeaten out tenon of0 Wisconsin initiative next week in Memphis 1966 January lots of the same day nobody has done 27 nothing by the way Jacobs past the 25 that's his Scarborough excuse me to the 26 so that's a good play on first down to Scarborough gets six yards this is where Scarborough has been effective over the course of his career fourthquarter late in the game you put in a running back it's 235 pounds he's difficult to bring down so when their legs are tired defensively dragging him down big number 9 is no easy task Scarborough again got the first down and more out to the 36 10 yards for Beau's Scarborough at Mississippi State defense is relatively fresh but right now Alabama's offensive line winning at the line of scrimmage and these backs are pressure they keep rotating with Harris Jacobs and now Scarborough thirdstraight caring for Scarborough another first down stepped out near midfield 13 more yards five and a half to go and Scarborough calling for substitution as he hobbles a bit to the sidelines he looked a little awkward going out of bounds right there if he could have tightrope that sideline there was a lot of green grass Brian Dave will the offensive coordinator calling the same play three consecutive snaps just to sweep to the right left wide side of the field first out of the Alabama 49 here's Harris off the right edge it's upended inside of the 35 but it's all about the run game here on the fourth quarter for Alabama just dominating Mississippi State with the rush in particular on the perimeter that play right there the exact same play if they ran the we try to get out on me yet 129 in the fourth quarter by 82 the first three quarters from the state 33 Paris again and this time they stopped up after a 1 yard game it's Errol Thompson who was injured earlier comes back on the field and makes a play here second and long really nice tackle by Errol Thompson right there there was some grass out in front of Harris if he could have a big number 40 but he drops him there for a short game second and a let's go throw it here facing flesh here and he just throws it away at the 31 thought grants of the defensive coordinator and you do account for Hertz Blake from fork and floor they brought pressure he broke they got a spy the quarterback they bless I'm 39 French taking a shot to Ridley down the beam into place a flag thrown at Chris Reaper there was contact at the 10yard line that's a good place to go at the ball because Ridley is so talented he's either going to catch it are they going to interfere with up on those jump balls pass interference defense in the 24 absolutely a lot of contact nearby Rayford good call by the officials not a popular call here in Starkville as you can hear from the crowd's reaction but the correct call nonetheless so it's a first down at the 16 yard line during the four minutes to play here in regulation that was a 15yard pass interference call and Chris razor hurts keeping it trying to and he steps out after middlegame to the 15 so this is where jaylen hurts it's been so good guys until I turn the ball over one time all year long but he has yet to turn the ball over in the red areas been perfect six touchdowns no turnovers he understands the moment in situational football in relationship to field position we have to wonder why dry and able has abandoned that wide sweep play here though Tom you think they might try to get back to that at some point on this Drive they had so much success with it earlier there is Harris lead in the backfield hurts on the world sanfur SAS by jeffrey Sinan although wait a second Hertz was acting as if he landed on that offender Simmons but they blew the whistle at the 20yard line so let's say big loss of about six yard once I heard says get up dog but we do jeffrey simmons at some point empty backfield is see fairness leading and down it's time to fire Andy Papp Anastas has made a 30 yarder tonight a season line is 46 he's 15 of 18 on the season it'll be a 44 yard old was good why to the left the path analysis who's been so consisted this year for Alabama and this asipi state takes over on its 23 with just one timeout 203 on the clock here in regulation it's a shovel pass and it gains only about a yard to fahrrad Green does Mississippi State go fast here or do they say you know what we got only one timeout let's be conservative I pay for overtime I think they play conservative but Alabama has to be thinking may have three timeouts in their hip pocket depending on what happens here on second down they could potentially decide to maybe take one and see if they can't get another possession I think Dan Mullins going off to run the football that's been the point of least resistance so far for Miss the snaploc take a shot on the hoodie Jones dropped it he had it and he rolled over and couldn't maintain possession oh my goodness Wow now it looked like he'd never had it actually on that replay throw his law would've been a great pick that he come up with it would have been a great pick just to miss communication between fitzgerald and the intended wide receiver he thought he's going to hook up over the middle I'm just surprised into the ball me too and they snapped it with so much time on the play clock when you're in a situation you back back to 24 yard line Fitzgerald design we'll call a timeout to stop the clock with 1:15 to go or will they know yeah they do they've been couple more seconds came off the clock there looked like it should have been 1:15 when that timeout was called board down really surprised by that sequence yeah me too from from Mississippi State opting to run the ball and then throw the ball not forcing Alabama to burn one of their timeouts now you're having to put it back to them giving them potentially good field position to give Papa Gnostic another shot maybe on a gamewinning field goal and he got Jalen Hertz to who has handled these situations so well yeah over the course of his career Alabama though the damage it's done in the fourth quarter Gregg has been running the football and out of the situation now without a lot of time left where it's probably going to be up to Hertz through the air with two timeouts you have a little bit more freedom to potentially run the ball from twos they need a good pun from cook and they kid they're caught by marks at the 32yard line tonight at 12:30 a.m. Eastern time 9:30 Pacific on SportsCenter following championship boxing on ESPN Kirk Herbstreit will break down showdown Saturday the impact of Miami's ups it over Notre Dame if it holds up also Sixers warriors Ben Simmons against Steph Curry Baker Mayfield may be running away with the Heisman at this rate Sports Center Linda cone stands erect also streaming on the ESPN a minute nine to go in regulation tied at 24 birds will fall out first down looking rolling out running stepping out and it gained only a yard 101 on the game clock the good job downfield guys by the secondary there for Mississippi State but more importantly the ability to keep your eyes on the quarterback come back and make a play and not let him yeah pull the ground that banal says just missed a 41 yarder his long of the season his 46 keep that in mind here of second in on hurts it's popped by ribbon at the 45 first down to the 48 yard line clock will stop as they reset the chains on Jalen Hertz I'm looking in the direction of number three on every single drop back hurts again to the air pressure covering ferrets on the roll of throws it out of bounds 44 seconds to go in regulation pressured by Lewis but now that you're at the 48 break just a running game come back into play here at all for Alabama I think that a quarterback draw could be the play call right here potentially because you have those timeouts you have to save one for the field goal unit but you have the luck running it if you so choose birds nickel a second time he gets hit Alabama that'll leave the tide with 136 seconds to go and they got five sects by Mississippi State in this ball game all right so drink you got third and long here thirtysix seconds remaining in the game not as Alabama handled this situation in regulation and a tie game like I said well in the last play I think it might be a quarterback draw because if you throw incomplete then you're potentially punting again and Mississippi State being as good as they are blocking punts and blocking kicks over the course of the last few seasons I think a run here right now see what you get and then evaluate how you want to play the fourth down conversion prevention however this thing shakes out what a day in college football number one Georgia Falls number three Notre Dame is getting blown out number two in regulation thanks necks hurts he's in trouble he said he steps up he's got clean but wait a timeout was called by Mississippi State nobody heard it prior to snap timeout Mississippi State third and final timeout of the half time at there's some boos but did you see how much running room hurts head off the left side there was nobody home was they don't know the ice the offense there that was interesting because they brought pressure and Jalen Hertz escaped and there was nothing but green grass out in front whirling dan mullen not liking what he saw from the defensive alignment or take a little addition time to take a peek what he wants to dial up does this change your strategy offensively now knowing the Mississippi State is palliative time battles on third you still run a quarterback draw and then if you get the first down great and if not you just run the clock out is you don't have to punt now right because you're inside 40 seconds to go on business city state doesn't have a timeout you can really take run every receiver as fast as human maneuver around showing books banning field goal range stepping out of the 26 with 31 seconds to go Todd Grantham the defensive coordinator for Mississippi State showed it you saw the pressure you saw the Blitz Brian Dave all knew it Jalen Hertz knew it delivered the slant on time to their best weapon at wide receiver cannot dismiss 140 43yarder from here than alabama they couldn't run the ball they have a horsemen to the goahead score with 25 seconds remaining live by the sword you die by the sword defensively when you man up in that situation you better be better than the opponent 3124 Alabama after Jalen Hurd's 11th touchdown pass in the season what an incredible sequence by Jalen Hertz in this offense blitz right in his face look Lauren off the edge and he finds Smith on the slam one of the most surehanded receivers on the team at the true freshman tension sit astride and defense bullet touchdowns mr. and mrs. Hertz are loving it pressed again with Jaylin heard to this moment and out Mississippi State out of timeouts they had to burn a couple early in the second half now you talked about Jalen hurts Dave and how he handles the moment just watch his body language whether you're in the peaks of the valleys of the game he carries himself exactly the same calling for for this football team on that sideline Tom really over the course of his career he's beaten so many opponents with his legs they city state knew that they said we're going to challenge you we're gonna blitz you yep uncritical down in distance he stands in there knowing he might get hit and delivers to perfect for the goahead score standing execution by the sophomore and it goes out of bounds what a terrible kick there what is he doing at the 35 yard line no idea why you would do that you get the ball now at the 35 yard line I know that he was trying to poach and keep it in play you've got to keep it in play there because now no time comes on the clock he got 24 seconds Grandda you got to go 65 yards without a timeout it's Gerald's got the arm though if they can just pick up ten or twelve or fifteen yards he can easily get it to the end zone in the potential Hail Mary situation so they put that second back on the clock no nope time should have come off there so they fix it to 25 seconds Fitzgerald in trouble chased out of the pocket go of Alabama you got one more of the sideline here 10 15 yards and then get two shots in the end zone maybe yeah I think so see if you can pick up another first down of course have to make sure everyone's alerted that a potential spike could happen if in fact the guy is tackled and balanced Fitzgerald building to his left now throws incomplete 11 seconds left Todd couldn't hang on a Verdun coverage two more plays you would think left here for Mississippi State and Pitt's here we'll take a moment and talk with his head coach Dan Mullen I get no timeouts Fitzgerald moving to his left again throws it downfield 20 incomplete Patrick downfield makes the play on Jordan Thomas five seconds to go one shot to the endzone that's the guy you want to target in a contested catch situation big Jordyn Thomas at sixfootfive coming off the field rather gingerly in a Hail Mary situation he's new you won on the field so that's a potentially big loss not out there on the field but Fitzgerald understands got to buy some time and heave it as long as he can into the end zone Alabama drops four guys deep in the end zone Fitzgerald backing up that's stepping up destroy Fama's rushing the field but we may have one more play here in Starkville pastor deters defense number 42 an untimed down one more shot to the endzone from mississippi state i have very rarely seen pass interference called on a Hail Mary but clearly Holcomb tackles the intended wide receiver made it an easy call for the official and it's a good call it's the correct call even though there's a lot of contact in that Hail Mary pit the correct call by the official so no time left Alabama has a timeout remaining trying to figure out where exactly to spot the ball was on the 49 yard line so 15yard penalty puts it on the 34 no time left final play unless a penalty on Alabama Fitzgerald backs up now launches it into the end zone Eddie throws two to four each the back of the endzone the game is over Alabama survives number one goes down number three about to fall but number two wins tonight come from behind fashion at Starkville what's got out to top coach how would you assess the performance of Jalen Hertz on that last Drive to take your football team down and win this game well I think he did a fabulous job in the whole second half great job in the last couple Drive so even when we missed a field goal that was a heck of a drive so really proud of our team that's a tough circumstance we had a lot to overcome God did a great job but your defense struggling to stop the run for most of the night but you made some plays late there in the fourth quarter how would you assess their before we got two stops when we needed to which is the most important thing and we didn't play that great but yeah technically looked like what we got to do to fix it and try to get it fixed with their play all right Thank You coach thank and there will be a familiar team at the top of the college football playoff rankings on Tuesday Alabama stays undefeated winning in Starkville against Mississippi State 3124 coming up next on ESPN top ranked boxing the Greg McElroy Tom Lydon bill our entire crew I'm Dave Pasch from Starkville",

  "transcript": "when it's not 90 degrees or feeling like 95 or 100 but we got the same today as we had last week and the week before Li Shu leads the alltime series this the 52nd edition and the last time offer and one here was 1999 at the long time ago cameron Gamble's got it teed up though charger on coming off one of the biggest wins of his career he told us in that victory over Florida we'll see if it carries over Gus Malzahn on the other side of his fifth season you know it's awesome Gus doesn't wear the sweater vest exactly and we're underway in Death Valley return looking after the 25 and we check the chickfila starting lineups led by the guy that Gary already talked about Jarret Stidham who was out last year after his freshman season at Baylor and came on highly touted and a little bit of a rocky start early but he's really come on the last three weeks yeah you can't help but love his arm ability he's been very very accurate and I one thing he has learned with this defense you don't need to score a lot of points to win you do not have to force the ball Miriam Johnson in the back here they faked it too and instead of watch to throw it out and I want to hit it catch man what a thrust pretty impressive Cannella the tight end and Stidham had it crusher I think was like it's your right in his face eat through that retreating and going to his right at the same time so they go hurry up after a pickup of eight and here's Johnson breaking into the secondary down the sideline coming off a big game a week ago with over 200 yards and he's got a first down there talked about that first pass they roll out locked her on the right side of your script well that's actually the run the second play right there the first pass he throws that the second play is a hurry up run to the right side and they tack on yards both teams interestingly have told us in our meetings they want to start fast actually for the same reason oh so you want to keep one team wants to get the crowd in the game if he wants to keep the crowd out of the game right now offers in the game and in LSU territory already at the 33 yard line he's a toss out to Johnson nice stiff arm maybe they got out of it you know when to top that off if you're Gus Malzahn you've been part of this you have been part of an offense that has come here since the last four times and have trailed at the half eighty three to three so he knows he does not want to get down in this game he's get the crowd of the game stenum looks to the sideline as with his offensive flux straight ahead Johnson got about three out of that we take a look at the rest of the Auburn lineup Boston's Golson who can play any position on that offensive line and might today well the big note on there for seniors playing in this game for Auburn on that line and that's going to be a big contrast to LSU's offensive line leading third down conversion team of the conference with a third and six here and their opening drive Stidham gonna go deep down the right sideline maybe it was really good coverage that time by grand elfin number nine bumped out to the outside he's he lists him as a safety but he bumps out man the man actually a perfect throw but darn good coverage there's another look in my stove had it lost it and out comes the field goal unit with one of the best in the business kind of steering right into the Sun on that play to leading scorer in Sec history but six field goals a year ago in this matchup this one from 46 yards out kick hit the light up it's good but a weapon huh Daniel Carlson you're not killing just a couple minutes into the game Auburn's offense stalled but you can always count on this guy point number 416 and when you're in a defense and you hold the team at home no touchdowns and lose you can get frustrated but still if it's stopped by LSU yet the CBS Sports app for the fastest scores an inside access to Auburn LSU and all your favorite teams download the CBS sports app today 3nothing Auburn's Tigers leading LSU Tigers after a 46yard march in six plays and Carlson's 46 yard field goal put them up you'll tee it up now and back deep Edwards our lair just wanted to mention Brad I got a text from Vern he just said one word oink I should hang next time it goes off the right upright burn it's a guy and this one they gonna keep it I didn't get out to the 25 and with that let's check the chickfila starting lineups the Tigers of LSU led by their quarterback Danny Etling there's his numbers of the year yeah and and truthfully Danny knows and everybody connected with the program knows the coach staff knows he has to up his game if they're going to beat the Auburn defense one of the best defenses we have in this league we need they need a better performance allaround performance from Danny Etling he's decisionmaking and throwing he knows it Matt Canada knows it we talk to those guys about it yesterday in motion first down at the back of the defender he had a lot of pressure though right in his face as he let it kill I mean that's really tough I mean you got marlon davidson right in your face a little bootleg and they were ready for it as he lets it go he's got pressure under throws it and just kind of you know maybe five yards short on the throw and you know it got Monta vias at concern right in the numbers look yes Trey Williams is not playing not starting that's why my Travis is in the game is Williams and he stuffed at the line of scrimmage not going down and finally does but no gain and it's gonna be third down at ten for the LSU offense the rest of the group looking like this Sadiq Charles there's the three freshman on the offensive line that are sterling and that's tough in anybody's league I think Adrian McGee is in the game at right tackle though in this game I think they might have made a late switch in the game so now only but only two leagues rushing got a redshirt Waterhouse's third down at 10 Lake pressure coming going deep down the middle got a man in church he's got and dropped it and offered scoops it up at the 37 going the other way Carlton Davis so a big pass play and then a fumble yeah it was an in and go they ran it and practice on Thursday first play a twominute drill watching it in and go a double move he had time to do it sharp makes the catch and then Stephen Roberts comes over makes a technique catapult on it there Diane LSU for big plays they finally get a big play and they put the ball in his hearse that part was good that part not so much Auburn ball with a three point lead when we come back a moment here to check the LSU defense and it got younger in the secondary because even though though George Ron told Ali that John battled with play Eric Monroe is the starter so we'll wait and see when battle comes in there he's the guy they look to in that secondary for leadership so they've got three freshmen back there and remembered it they already lost the safety at Paris so that's two of their safeties out guys that counted on in that second level keep it on the ground after the turnover area Johnson something to watch for LSU they don't have as many bodies and the defensive front as Auburn does Auburn will go ten deep in their defensive front LSU will go six they got the same lineup in there again can they last all day with their number one group out there second down and seven ball just shaded in to LSU territories didn't Logan a man wide open and he's got a minutes hastings touchdown will hastings a 49yard touchdown well if you're a quarterback when you got your slot matched up against the safety you say I got exactly what I want there you go you got your slap matched up on dealt with the safety safeties thinking Hastings is a short option runner not this time one move and he beats them by a mile look at that centerfield while that wide open perfect throw great protection up front and the big play from Auburn will hasty as quick as an eyeblink shows you why there Carlson in for the point after kick is up and good and Auburn wanted a fast start you can't get much faster than three and a half minutes into the game with a tenpoint lead 52 yards in just two plays the 49 yard long ball the Hastings and they are Byrne Tigers up 10 nothing a project smarter presented by Home Depot carry well sometimes the smartest thing to do is if you got a good pass rusher buckets maybe a question market defensive tackle you should rush art and key here to the left side of your screen drops their best pass rusher only rushing three players you get plenty of time to throw the deep ball think about that Ellis you only really rushes three and they still get the center field wide open for a touch not pass not very good defense not smart you see your tools that's Hastings third touchdown catch of the year it is longer so far we got a 47yard earlier in the season Carlson's been a busy kicker already and this one won't be returned either so here's the challenge as Daniel he comes back out in the field where are they going to find points you know last week against Florida got 217 held on almost afraid to throw the ball to name run the ball against this great rush defense where are they going to find the points to stay with our because it looks like Garber's going to put points up today as a defense for the Tigers on CBS Atkinson playing are there for Trey Williams who's out today Williams one of their leaders in the linebacking core and our Birds rolled through their backups are in already on the defensive line first down at the 25 the guy's arias only got about three probably as healthy as he's been in a while we saw in the second half a week ago it seemed like he got lathered up a little bit thanks so he gained confidence in and I think got hit a few times fell beauty bar where it was happening and still not the guy I remember from a year ago but pretty close now second down and eight haven't seen one of their jets meets what I was going to say we go here either gently going deep and overshot charkh good coverage back there by Audrey Matthews and apps third and long so now third and long with these pass rushers that Auburn will feature off the edges that will really strata here they come they're going to bring in their cheetah group four different players will come from different areas and they're all excellent pass rushers Holland Davidson who else they got out their balance their crown and Nicko another really good pass freshman at Lee those they're coming third down and eight things in there and throws a strike to Dylan there you go you're going to challenge that young offensive line remember them without their two starting offensive tackles plug it in Danny Etling steps up makes a good throw to the outside it's still oneonone coverage you have to have confidence in that throw nice route to the outside and they make it happen third and eight they get 16th at a first down at the 41 so when we see as Brad said the first jet sweep action not yet just a toss two guys puts his head down and goes for almost 5 not saving this Russell on the shop unless you wanted so badly to use the crowd to their advantage and Auburn has taken that out of it so far at the 45 second down at six the guys made one man miss cuts up inside nifty run but gonna be a first down and they keep pushing she push it as Brad mentioned the the jet sweep really turned this Florida defense inside out Matt candidate offensive coordinator came up with the package early and until about the third quarter of the game Florida really not got it didn't really get their defense planted with their cleats in the ground and the wide receivers it out rushing the wing backs ago here they just need a yard third and one guys whoop stop action and down it goes that didn't work so well Nick Cole makes the stop and a loss on the play again I mean you have you know elite defensive lineman playing against knitwear it's a bust it that's a busted assignment right there nobody black Nick go at all left tackle turns out at the play and just releases command at the point of attack it's not gonna work and I saw much of March for LSU runs into a Zak man Rosenberg punt and all very clears every there it's going to be down by La she's around the 16 or 17 yard line and Auburn their defense comes up with a big stop their offense will have it back with a tenpoint lead when we come back ten nothing harbour yeah let's look at that last chair play is going to be run right here but watch the two fresh fruits unique child's is going to pull out and just release the point of attack Nick Coe that's way too easy too big of a mental mistake and no matter how well the other ten guys did on that play the point of attack mistake costume though I will the ten point lead and go over the Wildcat here Johnson there's a couple of wouldbe tacklers he gets out to the 26 yeah you know they're gonna dice in a little bit of this Wildcat with carrion Johnson we do expect the see camera Pettway today doc Gus yesterday city's a little more healthy wants to get him 10 or 15 carries in the game Johnson got seven on that last year a Stinson motion now stops in they're gonna flip it out to him it's got a lot of room let's check in with Alex LSU's John battle showed his leadership on the sidelines getting right up and fresh and grant del phix face and saying you're better than that I want no excuses you said you know exactly what's coming you can be better than that don't hang your head let's move on to the next series told us yesterday the biggest thing for those freshmen is telling them and teaching them how to play big boy football this is big boy football first down at the 36 Johnson nice cut to the right dices his way through some traffic and got it out to the 42 in this game Dave Aranda is going to move art and key inside to play defensive tackle Martin watch what it's like to play defensive tackle kind of blown right off the ball this offensive line with a lot of seniors I've seen a lotta luck so they can run back I think he likes the edges he's lined up there again second and three same play first time la cuchara made the stop but Johnson's got the first down for Robert Gus Malzahn is opening drive on 46 yards ended in a Carlson field goal second time after the fumble return a 48 yard touchdown pass to Hastings and they've got it working again first down at the 47 already 45 yards on the ground for Marriott Johnson timeout call from the bench formation didn't work right Jared Steadman was still moving people around and Gus pulled the plug night suck thanks boy Harbaugh what I had a heart attack huh they lost that one yes a lot of mystery exactly here's a wildcat again cariann Johnson broke a tackle on a crate cut in the hole when he's 212 pounds of these shifty absolutely they say he's a great short yardage runner but look at that cut right in the middle of all the traffic up front getting a lot of clean out Darius team's a nice chap swishes guy pass modernday offense blocking is pusher guy any direction he wants to go running back I'll find a crack and then the Wildcat he's not afraid to throw once in a while steps back now the joint stood up in the backfield got it to the outside where he's to the 25 I think we're going to get number 78 I believe Darius James did he get the whole there was a little farther out there was such a nice hole out there when the running back starts in one direction where the play is designed and then goes outside it fools the offensive linemen they're trying to push their arm at in this case outside and then all of a sudden it goes the other way right in the middle of your screen you can see the hole that negates a big pickup and I think Casey done this guy actually got hurt a couple plays ago tried to play through the pain and he's not happy one of the captains of the offense will check out him when we come back and heading to the 10th is Casey done we told you earlier when we set the lineups Boston Golson can play all five positions on the offensive line and with that he ships from tackle to center here Cameron Pat wait the lineup for the first time for the Tigers stead of blade blitz in trouble buys himself some time and then goes down for a loss yeah see that's say almost exactly what was happening in the Clemson game with some of the sacks let's look at Casey done I think there was three plays ago the Casey done injured his right leg right obviously Center right in the middle of the thing let's take a peek see exactly what happened he starts off to his left and then pumps but the pro pile gets pushed into his right leg here's a long yardage situation for the Tigers they haven't been in this situation so far today third and 14 it's a must stop for this LSU defense they can't let Bella board convert here to throw out in the flat wide out screen and they're gonna get not only a big play in a first down but they might get a touchdown out of it all the way inside the five is Ryan Davis I'll tell you a chip Lindsay is living in Dave Aranda is the defensive coordinators head right now he expected the Blitz he got the Blitz wide receiver screen look at all the guys downfield he's got a convoy tries to set up every block at home gets a huge big play out of third and long LS she went man the band's lids on third and 13 that's a 52 yard pickup to the 4 yard line first and goal there the touchdown maker is going to get the direct snap and he's going to take it straight ahead and thirteenth score of the year carry on Johnson yep the only possible way that this doesn't count as if his knees touched just before he cross the line but they go Wildcat and they score touchdowns here's another look carry on Johnson diving forward just his knee came down but swear what's the ball when his knee came down you gotta slow it way down me down about dumb one we'll take a look at it for a team that was behind eighty three to three perhaps visits here this is huge for Robert Bob would snap something good 3 minutes 30 seconds to remaining in the first quarter today's Tyler stones fumble the snap but got it down and this guy got it in the end zone for the 13th time this year 17 nothing otter Wednesday on CBS David Boreanaz stars in a new drama about the most trusted team in the war on terror SEAL team new episode this Wednesday after survivor I got to wonder if the Tigers of LSU were going to survive a 17 to nothing deficit yeah and their offensively challenged anyway this is kind of the worst case scenario for them start now let's go back and look at third and what twelve or thirteen neste 14 yeah yeah don't really here is the five rushers one two three four five and if you watch right here the middle linebacker chases the back no one in the middle of the field they clear out six people get three blockers perfect call against the defense the up fire was only guy he didn't scare any Maui so what others started 225 remember LSU's last drive they come up with a third and wanted lost about three arts areas guys this is a setback first look at the Czech jets week action it's a point fake and here comes the rush and down goes at wing and it's Jeff Holland I'll tell you I've watched a lot of tape on hopper and I've watched a lot of football in the SEC in the last 12 years this front is elite there's as many athletes at the front eight nine ten for Auburn this year as teams like Alabama and Florida in the past or I'll tell you another one LSU in the plans in the pads in the past Holland who plays that buck position they call it that's his sack over five and a half that season Williams and Williams got an opening up the middle Williams good gain still gonna be third down so here we go right now this quarterbacks down right now you got to come through for your team your defenses sucking wind a little bit they can't stop them you need at least two or three first downs you know Auburn and Kevin steel is going to come with their dime package they're going to play combo coverages all over the field six defensive backs on the field tight end Moreau on the right side shark in motion XANA is a shovel pass to Williams in a short boy author those waiting right there forum Nick Ruffin lay the tech well coached you can see almost a lack of confidence for this LSU offense on a third and medium they really didn't trust their offensive line remember they had just gotten pummeled on the last one they try to get Mick a first down and the Auburn defense is very solid Ruffin does his job and it's an easy stop Ron Rosenberg to put again Roberts again will try to clear his teammates out of the way there's what it dropped down around the 21 yard line a minute 27 remaining in the quarter and 17 to nothing Auburn is rejected with Ally Geist a seed on his out of the 10th he's dealing with the right knee injury is heavily taped and wrapped he's doing some jogging on the sidelines he looks comfortable jogging but no official word from the team yet all right now he thanks you know what strikes me is this Auburn offense from the last couple years you know there were a run first offense but now there are a run and big play offense in the Mississippi State game our bird had seven plays of more than 30 yards and we've already seen a couple of big ones in this case yep a 49yard passport instead of looking for more yeah they want it all don't pay the overshot his intended receiver Eli Stone's hard and key got a little pressure that time they named him to get more and more pressure yeah you know where they talk to the staff and they say he's getting better every week but he did take five months off football no spring practice no fall practice he's trying to get football ready during the season very difficult lose carry on Johnson in the Wildcat fakes the handoff goes straight ahead another first down hood he's gonna have a hundred yards by the end of the first quarter the way he's going right he's come into the game with six career 100yard games and this Wildcat is giving the LSU team Fitts that in the blocking an offensive line he's averaging seven yards of pop comes back to join stood up in the backfield on first down and gets the carry again whoa broke one tackle and then ran hit la catcher now that time Devon white number 40 got in there and forced carrion to make a cut he was not running as tough behind his pads and la Couture gets to clean up watch number 40 makes the cut right there actually it wasn't it was 48 d Danny Alexander that enforced it Donnie Alexander and man Lockett sure cleans it up Johnson will stay in the Wildcat here on second and nine rates for his blockers doesn't find any nice play by key and he got help from Gilmore yeah Jared stidham's looking over at the bench enjoy are you aware that I'm cleat completing almost 80% of my pass here I just want to let you know over there coach up number one of the conference's in percentage well one group of Tigers had their way with the other 17 to nothing at the end of the first quarter for Auburn will return to Baton Rouge after this message and a word from your local station set to start the second quarter with Auburn up by 17 here in Baton Rouge gonna go Tony Romo on here and predict it they're not going to blitz what do you want to be a part of that one whatever you want to do and 9 Stidham pocket holds up for him long ball near saggy it was a beauty yes it was is he in he is dropped it right down the chimney the stovepipe the Darius latency look at this throw balls way up here watches they come right down the chimney can't stop that one and a fingertip catch with his left foot in everything going right for Robert right now Darius Lake was struggling with injuries so early this year he is there's deep threat and boy great king fake catch crater now they go Wildcat Johnson that's what I'm kind of talking you through it pretty well right that's what Gary damaged you know everything that could go right for the Auburn Tigers has everything go wrong for LSU burned it you know they can run the ball they can throw the ball they can stop the run they're very aggressive Nick and a secondary there a good solid football team LSU needed to play really well you know that early turnover on the completed pass I know that was the one I you know David lob they have that play back Johnson the backfield give it to him across the 30 Johnson all the way to the 20yard line what's three now once I miss when I did he jumps with his left foot twice as he goes sideways watch the middle of this rod watch it cut it cut again beautiful work right there by Johnson back to the red zone and they give it to him again that gets bumped right at the line of scrimmage by Gilmore and stopped for no gain maybe lost a yard I think he lands in the middle of this run obviously kind of going sideways down about six yards down and he goes watches that's right at the end of the play right there I said he might have 100 yards by the end of the first quarter he's got 89 so that backs them up to the 26 yard line Frank karynda's entered the game for LSU's his first action this year another body up front players they've been misses and they're going to get him active and playing in this game they need him in this heat against this offense take the end around to Davis Stidham fires too high and temper Hastings at around the five yeah I thought way too late to Hastings had them with a kind of a post corner move this Paul look at that this ball is thrown to the sideline it isn't it's way too high to the inside of the field had to be led away from the safety of kind of sale that stood up that time if will was six three maybe but not at five ten yeah grant Telford number nine is going I thought a safety I just had to play safety what's all this cover these guys they're down at sixteen rover they picked up a third and 14 of their last Drive and remember they got their kicker in their pocket here though that's gonna be motion I think up front a couple of penalties messing up this drive change the right tackle first guy right there just a shade early and that's the second penalty on the offensive line coming into this game the offensive line in 427 snaps only had two penalties that's over 2,000 opportunities they've got two already in this game here's their longest yardage situation on the first half third down and 21 they might just give it to they call timeout Auburn did why that was a good time out by Aubrey because that saved another 5yard penalty right look thanks well Oklahoma thinking after what happened to Clemson last night that all they have to do is just keep on winning and they'll be in the picture at the end it's a good wakeup call for all those elite teams up top and 41 I'd like to at least get a little bit of this to give Carlson an easier fuel goal I'm going to try to kill a strain on a Trent McGirt nice job by LSU defensively last year it was all fields old in Auburn's 1813 win because of this guy from 29 29 31 37 and 51 six few goals for Daniel Carlson in that win single games school record and now he comes out and this is going to be about a 48 yard attempt you see his numbers on the year the SE C's alltime leading scorer his first one hit the right uprights and went in 48yard field goal what a weapon to have you don't think about kickers until you don't have a good one Auburn's got a good one want to stay uptodate hey Siri show me college football scores look at on Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge the Tigers lost one of their greats why a tittle or the most iconic photographs maybe ever when he played for the New York Giants but he played here in the mid 40s 44 to 47 yelburton abraham tittle who passed away and in his locker they honored him with a locker today before the game passed away at the age of 90 on Sunday both Football Hall of Famer MVP of the Giants is 63 7 Pro Bowls he was one of the really good ones the bald eagle that's for sure I think he was actually drafted number one in two different years the NFL in the old American Football Conference finally a kick to be returned back at the nineteen do have a little connection with Yee Chinn illegal block in the back number 27 the CVT business or goal line a celebrity golf tournament away that's a good gig right they needed an extra golfer and my son rode with ye tittle and he was their fourth white man the day was nine years old that's pretty good it's a good way to spend a day it was why a one of three former Tigers who in the Pro Football Hall of Fame along with Steve Banderas and Jim Taylor right now they could use all those guys they're down 22 not have got it at the 10yard line after the penalty on the kick return Daria's guys the single setback to tight ends in for the Tigers and it's guys there's been one of the day picks up about 13 maybe 14 that gives them a little room to work me give you a little clue as to why the jet is not happening when this guy goes in motion Aubert is coming very wide with their safety they're giving the look too well as you watch it gets whips they're telling them we are not in alignment gonna let you get outside of us when the motion goes they get wide quickly there's the motion again and finally they give it to gauge gauge at a 30yard touchdown last week and he's off to the races here gauge one man it worked that time it sure did when that's all you got is the jet suite to use the chat suite first time they really ran at all game gauge goes one way comes back the other way the safety did not get wide enough to see that at first and goal at the seven Nick Ruffin did not get wide enough and all of a sudden the jet sweep gets outside the double motion one way or another did not allow the safety to get wide enough in a big play a big running play for LSU engage seventy yards on that carry down to the seventh and end of it he just kind but some LSU player right and his back with about two or three meters it was Steven Roberts number fourteen Jerry they got to take advantage if they do they're almost four down territory no matter what right yep I mean if you're calling plays now as Matt Canada you're thinking I'm using all four plays so I'm going to go with a seven it tried again with Dylan Dylan trying to get to the edge PPM's only got rekt at the one by Joe Harris Davis when you talk to the coaches around the league about these jet sweeps they talk in terms of option offense they say it's assignment football and to them it's almost insideout defense you got to stop the jet sweep as if it's a pitch first and then you got to move inside they've got guys in the backfield that Darryl Williams the other running back on a wing he's gonna go in motion nice not gonna get there fourth and goal yeah I think the flags down I wonder if Ellis she was in the neutral zone I wonder if excuse me Auburn lined up in the uterus all they did it the boy offside line up to the neutral zone number for the defense no Jeff Holland yeah just I think his head was overtheline right there so another crack at it here another third down a little bit closer at Lange under center with dice behind various dice err more nothing we created the line of scrimmage Auburn just pushes the LSU line backwards and didn't even allow Darius guys to get in the air he was going to try to dive over the top he had no chance to even jump captain's had met him in the hole but he got a great push up front there's their red zone efficiency this year and they need a yard badly fourth down has it worked so far they've got Tony Carter in that position every caught a touchdown pass a week ago try to get to the edge touchdown Sullivan boy they needed our took a fiveplace but they didn't go inside inside that time and they got a huge one Sullivan coming across hits at fullspeed breaks one tackle that time from Jeff Holland and that's all he needed extra point is up and good and the lights that LSU's Tigers desperately needed they just got on a 90yard drive in six plays the big one was Russell gage going 70 yards to get it closed Sullivan did the rest from the one on fourth and goal 22 7 Albert Stephon Sullivan's first carry as a college player is a touchdown they saved it they save for the last moment well they just did not feel they did too many shots up the middle they need a head to try something else whether it was a playaction pass or a jet sweep and they went jet sweet so gamble the kickoff big big noggin e and cam Martin are backing deep for the Auburn Tigers get out let me show you the big play that y'all we talked about assignment football and what they're trying to do here's Nick Ruffin the other safety Steven Roberts now watch what happens here when the motion goes this way there's good depth when it comes back Ruffin doesn't get outside enough and his assignment is the sweep why are you looking inside he takes that one step to look inside and it costs Auburn a big play Kevin Steele the defensive coordinator map that out for us yesterday said we got to get wide and let them run where they think they're going there's Kevin Kevin Steele right there right in front of us used to be defensive coordinator here at LSU can't that way in the lineup for just a second time let's see if this LSU defense could get juiced up we have not been calling the leading tackler in the SEC us a lot in this game Devon white yep I think he got one right there though well Eric Monroe though lost his hat so he's got to go out and play and remember he's in for John battle that's safety so they're probably gonna put like Jacoby Stevens to come in as lief play a snap there remember the toughness and the grip that LSU showed a week ago can they do it again in this football game coming from behind second down and nine the pet way he blasts his way across the 30 but it's nowhere to throw down at 40 Devon white just made backtoback tackles after we talked about it Casey done is back in at center moving goal sit back to left tackle to be a big stop for LSU they can stop a third and four we're out as into it through the defense Stidham leftside buyers almost interstate the coverage Kevin Tolliver yes it was well there's a lot of teams in the SEC that call themselves d bu but LSU loves their heritage it coroner and Kevin Tolliver gonna play mantoman right here and watch him break out the football he feels it he hits out it and he makes the play great defensive play by Tolliver one more half Stephon that might have been six the other wife's father's first punt of the day PJ chart back he's got a 65yard touchdown to his credit nice coverage to drop him at the 29yard line by Jamel Deane so LSU's got it back after a touchdown on their last Drive it's almost eight minutes remaining before halfton us great play by the corner Tolliver they give it back to their office it's in Morgantown here's what we've got going on our game before that jet sweep by Russell gage the running game it produced less than 30 yards for LSU nothing from the running backs go to the wide receiver one play they get 70 yards no running back has rushed for over a hundred yards against Auburn this year and it may have to be a wide receiver that doesn't hit the defense did their job now let's see what the offense will do from the 29 yard line Darryl Williams in there in the backfield Matt can define another big play the motion man got about three Cheryl Williams made the stop there are Williamson stop on Darryl Williams don't get that too often LSU is only 119 place in the first half they still need to give that defense couple first downs field goal something be huge in this football game for the Telus tree Tigers jog engage both to the right and now they bring it back to gauge this is played at down 70 this time it got him about a yard as we check in with Ally you guys Sullivan had his teammates cracking up or rolling their eyes either one after he scored that touchdown he Sprint's it over to the bike got on the bike and had so much energy he started pedaling really fast for about a minute saying I got to stay warm I got to stay well no one else down here is worrying about this 90 degree I would guess not very clever one career rushing he goes to the bike yep they're down conversion so far for LSU they need another here at third and six Jeff Holland has lined up as a linebacker he will rush from that spot here he comes Evelyn has time the tie tomorrow should have had it got hit as soon as the ball got there but it forth up and that's pretty darn good protection for Danny Etling this pass rush is fierce for Auburn you see number four Jeff Paulo taking on a lot of space in front of him throws it and come on step back to that football one step forward by Moreau might have been a completion I think had helped her quarterback that was a good throw there that should have been completed Rosenberg's punt roberts will feel 30 with a fair catch 621 remaining in the half and Auburn with a 13point lead and one timeout still to work with confident on the field and in the classroom here's today's scholar athletes presented by Quicken Loans Derrick brown from Auburn Danny Etling we just talked about for LSU Quicken Loans commitment to the investment of our future shown today by donating a thousand dollars to Auburn and LSU general scholarship fund or Danny AMA horn upstairs carry on Johnson the back view our Yuki way back there with the spread formations he's walking off darion johnson carries on into the secondary guys cut man that was pretty well defended again carry on johnson is able to see space where normal guys wouldn't watch this taking on well where's the hole where zonal cut back beautifully got nine second Avenue you are elections shifting on the defensive thought Johnson Soph the first down run and now he's over a hundred well you know Gus Malzahn loves to run the football and if he can run the football keep his defense on the bench run down the rest of this first half and get another field goal or a touchdown he will take that now his offensive coordinator chip Lindsay might be a little more aggressive 107 on the ground it's the carrier little bit of labia bell there you know see very patient pause relax trust that you're gonna find that crease you know where your offensive lineman or good run blockers he looks up and just says I'll just be very patient and I'll find something here he already said the 700 yard game now that's career playaction Stidham fire by Davis where you cannot do any better than that he faked the post playaction pass plenty of time to run this out and you look at that layout that was pretty first out of the 32 too many men in the field hurry up snap is gonna get a freak play instead of two they'll get five but to be very careful against the balls on offense when they make first downs that was not desertion to on the defense 12th player was not able to get off the field prior to the snap first sjon McDade our referee I remember as a defensive when they make a first down you want to get your regular group in there but Auburn doesn't substitute so they can go as fast as they watch and I got at least 12 men on the field Jonathan Rucker was the last guy trying to get off so it's first in five at the 27 tight end Paris in motion lead the way for carrion to be about a yard shy the first dumps would be second down and one well Mike Orton regular left guard for Auburn has played every game injured Austin Golson has gone to his the left guard position and Golson as Brad told us played five different spots on this offensive line and today he's in this third right now that's right there he is left guard number 73 right there second down a yard again yard line and they eat clock and they make first downs talk about Austin Golson the captain here's her snaps my position entering today center left I have a right tackle left and right guard even for a tight end in goal line that's a guy that can do it all and that's part of her pants philosophy the offensive line coach for Auburn so number 95 penalties declines personal foul glass through the space master number 18 of the defense this penalty they enforce at the goal line automatic first down I didn't see the face with I didn't hear Christian Lockett sure number 18 is the guy who was called and this methodical Drive continues she does get the ball to start the second half but they may need it Center Stidham tribal jet sweep of their own to standard stove cart meals down to about the eight maybe inside the eight you want to see how to turn the jet sweep is much Cory Thompson number 23 on this play he's gonna turn it in by kiddy width he sees the jet sweep he widens he takes on the blocker turns it into the help and allows the tackle to be paid over and back to the Wildcat he's their efficiency in the red zone area John LSU equal to the task and Devon white another big tackle for number 40s Devon white talked to us yesterday about not looking at the window dressing when the motion goes across don't even think about looking at that guys inside linebacker keep your eyes trained on the tailback for the remaining back and he did it on that one stood him now it's third and goal and got one on one on the bottom if they want to throw the fade he got away from the 8th there's this a very nice play by Williams at the last moment to get his right hand and remember that's andreas Williams a true freshman it's a great matchup I know no doubt you have to challenge the two freshmen right there and he came through they call him greedy and he was just greedy enough on the last second on that play yeah it's a perfect play nothing bad usually can happen on this thing but drea Williams comes through he leads the team in interceptions with three true freshmen by himself out there so that brings on Carlson for the third time there should be a chipper from 26 nothing good again 26yard field goal but it could have been worse LSU defense did their job to hold the Tigers of Auburn to three so Auburn goes 62 yards in 10 plays a little over 4 minutes off the clock they had to settle for a Carlson field goal but for the LSU Tigers a sort of a win need to give up another touchdown right there yeah but but if you're LSU an Iran has to look at candidates say you know we'd like to maybe be careful with the football down here danny has been a little shaky see end of the Florida first half where he was shaky but the way our bird is scoring you got all three timeouts I think you got to be aggressive you're going to get the second half kickoff you got to get back in this game you're not gonna be able to simply say Edwards a lair will feel this one 2:16 to play LSU has all its timeouts yep you just can't waste the possession here going up Geico halftime report look Vijay and Rick have all the scores and highlights from earlier games talk about this one look ahead to what is yet to come tonight so on the Geico halftime report we're gonna be out there with them because we're always on I don't think no no it's hotdogs times a guy down the kickoff I think it's Jason Smith yep pretty bad when you get hurt on a kick return that isn't returned I don't wanna lose in return see if we can oh wow it was just like a bump to I help him off we're like a charlie horse hit him right there and then right there little midthigh senior automobile well you know he had to slow down he saw the touchback right maybe shouldn't slow down yes so let's see what up unless you can do with two 16 three timeouts gary said can you get aggressive yeah you have to and you got to be rhythm passes you know you're not gonna have all day get the ball in and out of your hands it's chart no katako down the sideline there's the big plane they need it it's all the way to the 38th and now you got your whole offense as a long throw a bit of a gamble by Carlson Davis that time he misjudge the throw it cost it you need to play safe there Carlton you cannot give up a big play on a three yard pass pick up a 37 trouble in the pocket I think Jeff Hollins thought he had a sack he was gonna say when wait a second I don't want to get called for roughing the passer watch Holland come around hey handsome and then all of a sudden he gets rid of it the keeper head to the sideline got out of bounds with 1:25 to go on a first down you can take your time no brewery at all here LS you've got an eternity especially with that full pocket of timeouts at the 27 my Carleton Davis like to have that one back to a three yard pass you get burned like that with that big of a play by chalk three wideouts to the nearside the heat that's intercepted receiver fell down and is picked off by Daniel Thomas yeah Russell Gates did falls on a slow wait a minute maybe he didn't catch you about one of the official rap I'll tell you that right now Russell gage is the guy he's in the slot and that's an easy interception he drops it drip off nice call by the officials yeah Daniel Thomas would like to have that one back that might cost him and Ling quick slant that complete Russell gage short of the first down but they're inside the 20 unless you line it up in a hurry you'll be about a minute left when we snap this we need a first down here they need to run the ball Williams he got the first down and then some inside the 15 to the 14 years and got this Auburn defense a bit on the run now do they take a timeout err that just call another flight they're coming up to the line it looks like they're just gonna keep grinding 45 seconds in the half I'll take the time out I think it was my travia's Atkinson number 48 that read that play and made the tackle that's the second time they tried that a lot of congestion in there not a lot of space I think was a good kind to call that though a lot of actually going on the field Auburn's suck and wind a little bit on defense catch up with a bit of a trick play and didn't work this is a breather for the Auburn defense as Gary sitting on their heels a little bit now they get a breather during the timeout to get to this point there were two big plays starting with shark on this quick out yeah b\u00fcndchen something a three yard pass for 39 yard games throw it out there you're just trying to get it you know first in five they get 40 yard game 39 now game and then almost a interception Epling keeps his ball alive on one play earlier before he almost threw the interception to big huge place for the SU offense at the 14 yard line 40 seconds remaining two timeouts on this drive down the only four or five Tipton field going into halftime with points on the board here for this LSU offense the ages of the slot gonna throw to the gage diving attempt that he catch it yes touchdown it's closed it's closed it's very close let's make sure he caught it see until he's behind the camera on that one here's the look another layout does the ball bounce actually remind another camera we got cameras everywhere here now he's behind the body they're gonna give him the touchdown I think we do not have anything clear this play unless we see something on this one the ball can touch the ground that's not a big deal right yeah I think they're gonna count it what a catch beautiful and Danny Etling Connor Culp with a doink but what a touchdown grab by Russell gage 14 yards to give LSU 14 points five yards in a minute 45 seconds yeah here's the matchup third man in one of the plays that everybody has in college football inside slot is going to be oneonone coverage it's on the corner perfect throw from Danny Etling mantoman coverage tamal team gets beat ball goes up it was close but nothing to overrule muscle gage second touchdown of the year through the air and it's made at a 23 14 game on the return yardline well there's consequences rightness consequences all the time you have a chance to put away a drive you have to put away Daniel Thomas when he gets a gift that's gonna end the half yep it did not end the half Russell gage tripped and fell on that one and you get the light and they make it count 75yard Drive 8 plays key play was at 37 yard quick out that DJ chart took down to the 38 yard line that opened up the offense didn't it that allowed you know that Canada to feel good about calling any play and LSU stays in this football game down just 9 Gary R Johnson that was for seven more yards to add to his total here the first half which is up around honor 224 on the ground and that might be it for the first half again ever since that Troy loss they went into Florida the leaders of this LSU team took over and said if we're going to lose were to lose like men you should see practice 30 Thursday they were in everybody's face and they fought really hard in this football game might not be a sellout crowd here today but they're making some noise for their team as they head to the locker room the first half 2314 when they head out they'll get the football where Ali's halftime interview with coach Arthur rod you can go to Twitter at SEC on CBS but right now let's head that him sucker the guys in our New York studios all right now forgot illegal white room that you're really trying to get it and you don't really need a big perfect does it taste as good as you remember thank you the back end is only less could say it and coaches meetings are not the same without last mile but you know what this LSU teacher lured from that 2017 they were down 10 points to Auburn in 2007 came back and won that game only nine points the biggest story of the first half Alice you stayed in the football camp and a great drive 75 yard march before halftime to put them right in the thick of things as we start the third quarter in Baton Rouge at the 25yard line the Tigers with the ball that link bloating and couldn't get rid of it the yards loses three supply game is gonna be sacked for a fiveyard loss got a couple back yeah I thought Marlin Davidson was going to get him that time was it Davidson three or four coming around the corner it was Marlin Davidson I thought he had him and then it ended up being Jeff Holland gets the sack his second of the day here's an endaround Dillon giving a lot of ground try to get to the corner we got back to gain maybe two yards from the original live scrimmage well if you look at the trends in the first half you can see the big story was Carrie Anne Johnson being able to run the ball nearly the whole half over a hundred yards the LSU running game with the running backs as we talked about wasn't there the big jet sweep Danny Etling started out slow but that quick out for shark at the end of the first half allowed him to throw that touchdown pass keeps them in the game but here be careful third and long this front for Auburn list for 30 long all three wideouts to the left looking that way through complete to sharp first down how about that go down 12 yards and once ye chills used to call this pass back you say son just go out there 12 yards I'll get you the ball yep back in 46 they threw that same round night first down at the 38 yard lights that's a big third down conversion Gus I remember to true freshman playing a lot of guys playing different positions and that offensive line great story for this offensive football team be able to play without both offensive tackles in this game now you can go back to guys if you choose though it's gonna be a throw maybe by gage floats and fires did he catch it I don't think so while taya Steven Roberts thought saw his life pass in front of him he could feel it behind them the ball was just overgrown by a yard I'm surprised Roberts didn't grab and get a penalty on the play he kind of almost did but it wasn't enough and drink Davis did not get the pass interference call that's what he was looking for instead second down and ten that's the bad Canada chips we've all come though look at watch and then the jet sweep off it nope straight ahead with Dyson Darius dances spins his way out to the 45 but mission accomplished he's gettin up Chad sweeps and it allows that offensive line to get a crease that's all you need a crease and they got it they got a manageable third down here they're down at three and our Adrian McCurry segi number 73 has played the whole game two weeks ago Ness he was not even on the depth chart couldn't even find his name yet the media guide to find the guy they picked up a third and long can they pick up a third and short got a bunch set over there on the right that gauge comes back in motion to the slot case wide open what and builders to gauge the first out remember they ran that same type of thing to put gauge in the slot when they threw the touchdown pass late in the second quarter this time he's got oneonone coverage to the outside that clears it out allows gauge to go right out there you read the outside guy if you see it's mantoman you know yet sage on the quick out to pitch and cat nice third down conversions rattling now and they got it at midfield opening possession third quarter for LSU Tigers nice all over and he drags him to the 44 yard line let's check in with Ally guys coach Malzahn told me it's a half he told the team were up nine in a place that we haven't won since 1999 we're in good shape he believes they know what LS he's going to do on offense it's just about executing Auburn did confirm also that tre Matthews will not return with the hamstring it's a tough break for them and that's why Daniel Thomas was in the game that would have been trained Matthews on that interception he'd been trade dropping him guys behind that Lee gets the call gets the first down I thought he was going to lose a handle and not only did he not lose the handle he broke about three tackles first down remember when the season started this year darius Geist was named number one for all the running backs it was the year of the running backs Quan Barkley Bryce love Nick Chubb beau Scarborough everyone thought Darius Geist was going to be the guy to watch he gets hurt he's just now finally getting healthy not on another first down at the 38 they toss it to try to get to the edge get there and lose two or three Davidson done out there along with Roberts to push him out of my own I wonder if this LSU offense can do what they did at week ago against Florida remember at Florida they kicked a field goal to end the half and came back in the first series of the third quarter remember the long 50/50 bucket shark they scored a touchdown can they do it at least they got the touchdown in the half could they back it up with at least a field goal here that go on the sideline getting some hydration second at 12 chart in motion intended for Gage and complete Daniel Thomas was covered here's no the third long first possession of the third quarter they had a third and 12 and they picked it up on that button it has accomplished one thing no it's a 10play Drive you know allowed them get some offense keep that Auburn defense out on the field remember his second half that Auburn defense is in the Sun while the LSU bench is in the shade that bench for augurs miss staring right in the Sun for about another 45 minutes that lay in trouble somehow got a and throws it away nice escape by Etling just to get rid of that thing yeah that was almost like the one in the first half see on the left side that awkward bench nice and cool in the shade excuse me the LSU bench on the left and the Auburn bench on the right side in the Sun and there's your nice and cool but that's in the Sun yeah that's on too close to 100 in the Sun you keep telling me it's not hollow grabbed into punt Roberts waits on the other end this will just be a fair catch out of 10 for the first time in the third quarter on offense nine and a half remaining in the third quarter good matchup of tigers from Auburn from LSU 23 14 well LSU's offense didn't score but they did flip the field a little bit and offer to have to work from its own 10yard line hammered that way in the backfield gotta believe they'll go back to this morning and pounding game don't you think Ria's cam trying to pound and he gets handled from behind but he goes forward for maybe two yards this is the first time really since before the Mississippi State game last year that carry on Johnson in camp that we're both pretty much healthy at the same time and they wanted to get cam 10 or 15 snaps running back not only to give carry on Johnson a breather but to get him back in gear as he's at 235 pounds and there's Kerry honors over 100 already in the first half carry on is just cutting ability and big playability is just kind of almost stole in that position Ville tamara's engine still flushed out of the pocket take a hit from Arden key right at the line of scrimmage Vanessa Cameron dead weight might not be getting as many carries she wants but watch him pass block steps up in the pocket and Johnson back in there for receiver group though first didn't they're down at seven and iron she make a play he's at his track stay.its up there on the right side Hastings on a crossing right wide open can't get to the sticks no again man what a tackle greedy Williams great open field tackle yeah I think well hastens would like that one back thought he should have planted his right foot and don't for the line Oh roughing the passer as well let's go to the ball oh and an RT key hits him about a step and a half late on the play that's a you watch it I thought well hey C's could have just stepped up and drove across the line he tries to go outside and Williams makes the nice tackle but it's gonna be a first down anyway so they gave operative freebie there that is a frustration penalty ardent keys used to sack in the quarterback he can't get there and he just got too aggressive where's down at 34 here's an endaround Eli's stove looking for a block in his quarterback maybe got four yards out of it Kevin Tolliver made a stop here he was talking about the Sun and the shade of these respective benches LSU on the near side in the shade a nice nice cool what 80 88 degrees that's 200 over there degrees it's amazing that could go out and buy those thermometers that fast the things we talked about it they run to the store come back out here get it we got unbelievable proof yes they're very fast second at six Johnson runs into his own man breaks it outside he tumbles into the Auburn bench well you know I mean you play good defense you stop the line of scrimmage you run right into your big tackle perfect prints I know I actually was day Darius James number 78 that time bounced outside that's how running backs make your offensive line look better than they really are sometimes you got just what he needed to first down 22 carries that's how many he had a year ago in this game from 93 yards today it's 22 for 129 and we got a long ways to go it's about to say empty backfield but camp that way comes back to join Stidham nice open field tackle by grant Delpit the freshman that's a that's a self it on a veteran running back that's 235 pounds huh LSU has played 20 true freshmen so far this season the most in all of college football Delpit is one of those true freshman Ben Burke once we saw that will Hansen's got him but that's all you got that too you play on the job training yep then it would status online as do the rests of the offense for Robert Monica a second and 12 in fires far side and completes a a Kevin Tolliver will not back up he has no fear at all anyone going to Darius late in that time did not back up Tolliver at all one on one he's on it he hunts it no throw possible there great defense this is the biggest third down that a flag flies in what might be twelve men in the formation well it was late knew was trying to get off at the end of the play our lease see number 81 trying the hustle over there there is once you get into formation it's just like getting in the huddle they're gonna call it naps are down at a bunch longest third down today for Robert and the crowd is a bigger factor now than any time in the game they've been tough for that off instead of pocket holds up crossing route Hastings dropped it for thefts don't think he would have made a first down I think Kevin Tolliver would have stopped them they're short of the first down but good fast protection they go to gauge things I don't think he would have got the first down Toliver number two says Ida had you right here right over the umpires head that might have had a stings take his eye off the ball just for a second the Gary's right I think he would have been well short and that forces a punt DJ shark big play guy waiting on the other end from Aden Marshall and he'll out of bounds right at the 25yard line 533 remaining third quarter LSU's defense does its job hands it back settling and company when we come back the art of Cajun cooking does that look good what and I think our duck will agree Aflac trivia question we asked you earlier bcs college football playoff air which teams won a national championship their home state we figured we gave you a little bit of a hint LSU in oh three and oh seven and Florida did it in oh eight Oklahoma was looser and two of those no gain for Darryl Williams I know as Kevin Steele Brad told you there is working the gum a little bit I've been all around college football stops here as he said two years ago before he went followed up Will Muschamp as defensive coordinator for this Auburn football team he actually gives will a lot of credit for setting the path for this awkward defense to be what it is now a lot of man to man went out recruited the corners and the edge and we all know we'll can build the defensive see what I like shoes offense can do short throw and short armed that one intended for John David Moore John David Moore fell down that time rattling wood had an easy completion but let's go back to the first play too big of a gamble in that time by Carlton Davis Lau's the first play to be almost 40 yards in the hopup this by Danny Etling getting and boarding a sack and then these reciprocal of those gifts as a quarterback one of those oh my gosh I get to do this again and if I do I don't mind allowing it up I put the touchdown you know Matt Canada said Danny Etling he had to have his best game I think he actually yes I think so too gonna need 10 here though on third down and here comes the rush steps up fires and incomplete intended for Derrick Dylan I thought Derrick Dylan stops on the house Danny Etling thought he was going to keep coming across the field and Dylan stopped that's why the ball looked like it was such a poor throw honey Danny was also maybe thinking about a holding call he's still looking up at the jumbotron yeah he's wondering what happened to my receiver he was running across that field full stream huh huh while rosenberg to punt around his own 15 Stephen Roberts has to backpedal on this one got it at the 27 and play great job by Russell gages doing it all as a runner receiver and on special teams because they know that was about a 15 yard extra yardage there if he doesn't make that tackle Stephen Roberts gonna make one guy miss and goes down right there ninepoint lead for Auburn their only blemish on the season in a five and one start to the Clemson Tigers remember when the earth was falling and it was really bad it was 11 sacks against the Clemson team when he actually watched the tape it was a little bit of everything in this football game some crowd noise where the left tackle didn't get up and a little bit of jarred Stidham holding the ball a little bit too much they cleaned that up and hasn't been a story in this game just one sack for the sovereign football team those negative place early we're killing the offense they've got that out of their game now remember he would a whole year without playing so he was still getting in to bigtime football after a year off here he's got a first down at the Johnson five more or maybe six let's check in with Ally guys LSU's defensive and Rashard Lawrence is dealing with ankle injuries to both ankles he went into the half before the team earlier then they just put him back in the gentle reap tape boat he suffered one against BYU and it just keeps creeping back up he sets up the other today and he's there he's there bell cow on defense he really is he's their leader but they got Frank Herron that they could put in the rotation until this game they didn't have that no sup at that position stated playaction dared going along and jump ball broken up with Darius case was lucky Darius Slayton was fortunate to knock that one up because if he doesn't knock that ball away that's an interception there he is playing defense yes is that Delta take there said oh I thought I had one there now see with it as a plea collar you got 2nd and 5 you call a pass play you're expecting your quarterback if it's not there to drop that thing off don't need to take a risk on second and 5 so third down need to get to the 40 Stidham flushed out of the pocket gonna try to run for it he's dragged down by Devon white how about that played by Devon white he puts us to the right and then comes back and makes the sack or almost sack on the play White's gonna go one direction he's over here he's reading the play and then as it bounces out he comes in while it falls off and make it he's made a lot of those early this year through six weeks we talked to him yesterday he looks you right in the eye when I talked to you he was afraid I was gonna get sacked a couple of times no Marshall the puck PJ charcoal fair catch taking around 24 yard line so LSU's got it back they're still down nine still a lot of football left 3:06 remaining third quarter in Baton Rouge yes touchdown Auburn still where we were at HAP tonight 23:14 in Auburn in front don't forget tell that before we're done play the game presented by NAPA Auto Parts we've got some good candidates we got a long ways yet to go Brad Nessler Gary that isn't Ali to force our CBS crew with you in Baton Rouge battled Tigers for the 52nd time and Auburn has lost eight straight here in Death Valley but they've got the lead and they've had it most of the game or the entire game first down from the 24 but that's going to be a free five Jeff Colin lost his balance fell into the neutral zone I take it back my fault Adrienne McGee yeah we were talking about earlier two weeks ago didn't even find him on the to deep depth chart is starting at offensive tackle and the LSU offensive linemen were not happy with that call and after that the crowd saw the same repeat replay weren't happening uh so it goes v the opposite direction that I bought the motion loads goes deep in that chart admit to you first now tell su while Nick ruff and knew the play the safety he anticipated watch him come over here he knows he's gonna run the wheel round he beats Chuck to the play I'm ahead of ya no way the quarterbacks gonna throw it books back shoulder throw and a good one yes it was hiccup of 31 Maine you do exactly what the coach told you here it comes I got it I'm in front of them that's completely 172 chart now a motion all the way across the field at its Justin McMillan this position we thought that we might see him today a little bit trying to find any offense anywhere to help this keep this Auburn defense offbalance Auburn will just treat this even though it's a quarterback Justin McMillan now treat it like a running back until he proves but these offensive staff will let him throw the ball peddling raising a second at 11:30 major loss of one not one jet sweep yet in the second half for LSU will they show it will they do it that's Dillon they show it but they give it the guys and guys into Auburn territory third down coming up here for the LSU Tigers Bank of your mad cat Canada calling plays you could not be happier with the past protection that young changing offensive line has given the LSU quarterback Danny Etling in this game there's Matt yep well charkh engage have been the big play guys at the receiver spots today friendly fires far side all incomplete intended for gage broken up by Jamel Deane and again it was a decent pocket and remember this is a needle deep pass rushers for Auburn good time to step into it that's all you can ask for put it up there 50/50 ball Clemson bred through seven 5050 balls just mantoman it's a go up and get it they got two of them and one pass interference you have to challenge Auburn's mantoman coverage background Rosa verda putt again Roberts just lets it go goes all the way to the end zone with 58 seconds remaining in the third quarter and now it tastes a tradition presented by Sonic here's Ali hey Brad so did you ever wonder how purple and gold became the LSU school colors well the story actually traces back to 1893 when dr. Charles coats he was one of the world's leading sugar chemists he amalgamated the two colors together dr. coats a chemistry professor here on campus was assigned to coach the tiger football team before the first game he went on to bison special material to gussy up the jerseys which are blue and white back then well stores were stocking up from right across the only fabric available a purple and gold two of the three traditional Mardi Gras colors the Tigers lost that game he didn't coach again but the sugar professor delivered some sweet history did he ever and when you go to Mardi Gras you go to New Orleans or out here most of the beads are golden purple and a lot of student body throw some beads at me doing an open of a basketball game one time they all saved him until we did the on camera and they came flying at me final half minute of the third quarter Callie was talking about the injury to Rashard Lawrence he is back in the game number 90 no harden Kea to stay there on the other side warrior playing number nine he makes that tackle it was such a great thing for the LSU fans that watch these guys lay it on the field not playing for their own name playing for the LSU name seniors take out in the black with Lawrence does and watch her make the tackle what a play do they have some more of that and some offense in the fourth quarter that's the question they are down by nine at home to the Auburn Tigers into 323 14 tiger bowls got a quarter left will return to Baton Rouge after this message and a word from your local station margin down the Mississippi and margin into the fourth quarter at Tiger Stadium at Baton Rouge Auburn 23 LSU 14 third down and five Auburn at its own 25 crowd trying to help the LSU defense Stidham steps up fires near sideline \u00e7etin couldn't get to it and it's fourth down Toliver again holding his own over on that corner as we start the fourth quarter Brad Nessler with gary Danielson something just flew in in the face god hey we got a good game we do you know it's all been either LSU's defense or lack of execution by this Auburn off and say a 188 yards in the first quarter last two quarters under 130 only have thrown the ball under 50 yards last to the corner you sit Danny Etling spent his best game they take more out of it right needed at least an a game from and he's got to finish this off they need two scores and we've seen some crazy things happen in these game right to the last charka Camp Center this one at the 25 be a block in the back maybe not Chuck going the other way got the corner blockers in front turn down the sidelines he's gonna take it seventyfive yards his second flip return touchdown of the year the man they call the flash just flashed 475 it has his team right in the thick of things well there are a couple blocks that were close and I'm sure we'll get another look at it but once charkh got to the sidelines he's too fast for anybody to catch and good 23:21 and nothing I don't say anything and it goes are all good no calls right there the L is in at the end you could be Steve to take there Kobe Stevens number three with a great shield fly the last guy that have a chance couldn't get through number three and now it's time for our Geico game recap the pretty fun stuff to recap with Geico Derek Stidham 165 yards a long haul to Hastings was a first touchdown of the day for Auburn Danny Etling Gary and I said think this is the best we've seen him look this one did shark was a big play that led to scores Marriott Johnson has been the workhorse today in the backfield for Robert his seventh career 100yard game including some great runs out of a wildcat and then this guy Russell gage the long 70 order to get him close Etling after what would have been an interception lays it out to gauge for the touchdown and then moments ago the guy that called the flash DJ chart second time this year he's taking one to the house on a punt return 75 yards and so 30 seconds into the fourth quarter it is 23 to 21 in this place is starting to rock a little bit now I know all these Auburn players don't remember how long it's been but dis show underlined s how long it spends that they've won there we were working together the last time there's a kick it's gonna be fielded at the 2 and he's got the return to the 25 let's check that night after Turks scored the touchdown you saw a guy in a red hat go running down the sidelines it was Brandon LaFell the former tiger who now plays for the Cincinnati Bengals he said that's my guy and moments before that play he pulled him aside he said you can't your teammates that they have to go out there and make it happen you have to show them and he responded on the very next play with the touchdown guess so oh well and there's a lot of LSU guys in the NFL more than any other college team 50x LSU players in the NFL number one like I said earlier it may not be full but it's getting noisy in here let's see if carry on Johnson can quiet the cow goes for four more Devon white as always seems like in on the tackle carry on Johnson's closing in on his career high in carries which happened a week ago so did it 28 times in the win over Ole Miss there are no easy pass completions for Auburn on the field I don't know why why are they just constantly throwing the deep ball give him a short pass maybe the Hastings they're gonna keep running it yards short Johnson hard to convey to stop that tonight throw down at one remember this game was 20 to nothing Auburn two field goals since the first quarter for the sovereign offense less than 50 yards passing you know their last two series replays five yards puffball times here they go they got another third down they got extra tackle in the game now they've got six offensive linemen in the game let's say it's carrion Johnson no it's not it's an endaround the Eli stove stove got the edge got the first down when Devon white made the stop but not before removes the change I was a good did a good job of keeping this from not being a big play look at him make up ground on that play stove is a big fest a fast guy and white runs him down so there's the first first half of the arm of offense in their last three possessions we were talking about where with the LSU offense come we're asking the same question about Alden pasta bowls in his back at center JC done injured again Arion Johnson hesitates lassies way ahead got about four out of that again one of the questions I had about this offense is would this Auburn offense be effective under gusts without the quarterback having the key look at that ignore it by LSU's that's Nick Marshall or Cam Newton they're not ignoring that got that right the next carry by carry on Johnson will be the most he's ever had in one game number 29 of dives forward to midfield Masseria was talking about those two guys running quarterbacks not so much with number eight yeah when we talk to Gus he said I've done it before without a running quarterback get out I listened but I don't remember any championships third and one will it be the thirtieth carry for carry on Johnson and he didn't get there stop short big decision for Gus Malzahn right here will he go for it on fourth down Donny Alexander was the first guy to meet Johnson same look that they handed the sweep before he's going to go pump formation at least I'm surprised forth in less than a yard last time Aiden Marshall funded to number seven it went 75 yards the other way I was think he would like to keep it out of his hands take it a mile in the air way sure yep and it's either my upholstery that fall is free right dead right there and right there's about the 27 yard line here we go LSU's got it back 1028 to play down to going to have a great finish in Death Valley Louisiana State Museum all a culture of history this great States and here in Baton Rouge reminder for you coming up after our game state to the CBS sports postgame show powered by Rams we've got 10:28 remaining in the fourth quarter and the Auburn Tigers clinging to a twopoint lead and the LSU Tigers have it back on offense from the 27 here's a give the guys darius darius guys nice stiff arm got about 15 so this is a formation that LSU could not Beecher until they got a healthy guys having two running backs in the game Matt told us yesterday that he had a real package put together for Williams and guys together and you see it right there he gave Daniel Thomas one right in the face mask with that left hand to pick up an extra five yards an out guys split out as a wide receiver he'll come in motion first down at the 40 see again notes Danny Etling he's gotta know where his other guys are he's got Darius guys to drop the ball off to after he bakes the fake if you don't have it your coach is depending on you to say go to your progression if it's not open down here remember the guy you faked it to watch playaction pass nothing there drop it drop it off to your running back there was nobody we're gonna get intentional grounding nobody within 15 yards of guys either nope and he's in the pocket and you have to throw it to receiver when you're in the pocket laughs sit down as well see that's that's just a mental mistake that you're hoping when you call one of these plays that your quarterback fits not there I'm going to give you a play that's a big play but if it's not there don't hurt us and that's exactly what happened second down at 16 the big shift will move to tight ends to the left as well as Dillon maybe a yard Steven Roberts from the secondary was the first man to get to it while you can almost feel on that call Matt Canada says it's a feels old game I'm second and third and long I'm not gonna have my quarterback make a big mistake here and end this football game but just if we have to let's punt it but let's do something safe here let's not make a mistake at this time there's nothing wrong with a punt there's still a lot of time to go third and 15 Harbor Tigers branded a blitz that Lee is gonna throw along wall to chart began I don't know if didson just lost track of the play or the ball or one but it fell in the lap of chart and what a safe throw it was you're gonna throw it throw it downfield man the man either your guy gets it or nobody gets it all the way down to the 34 one of those 50/50 balls that hurt Auburn in the Clemson game now some indecision I don't know if he thought that he was gonna hand that off that didn't look good I can Clemson through about seven or eight of these 50/50 balls Auburn plays mantoman coverage throw the ball on third down if a mistake happens we want to have it way downfield we don't want to throw those interceptions eight or ten yards down the field great call by Matt Camden Jacque gets a breather he's been unbelievable in just about every capacity today including on special teams second down at 12 Williams with that Ling in the backfield and that leaves in trouble again and all the kids up again he throws at the last tip he might get attentional grounding again or was his knee down they might have this as a sack was outside the pocket was able to throw forward passed across the line stream and curtain down was his knee down before he threw it very close it's a bangbang boys it is difference of a what couple of yards maybe on the call I think you're right here and any rates throw down at 12 when backs out of the Blitz Italy still though getting heat throws knocked up in the air then complete and you'll Thomas back there so is Darryl Williams and it's fourth down yeah this would be about a 54yard field goal from this spot he's right on the sidelines good job knocked away that time had a chance one more step back maybe you could have had it but good defense routings go to punt little too long the trial if it was Daniel Carlson it wouldn't be well the LSU kickers probably and over in punt will it make it to the end zone no can he feel another wide receiver just engage all over the field Jharkhand Gager everywhere yes they are they run it they play special teams they catch it they make touchdowns and they produce field position I'm Gary Paul Johnson to Mark Richt know each other pretty well don't they 23 221 at the 3 yard line Auburn has to take over an office now like every year right Georgia Georgia Tech yep Jacque has been all over the place today so is gage seven and eightythree they're not on the field right now because they don't play defense that's the only thing they don't to carry on Johnson in the endzone for Stidham the loss key is there and so's Devon white yeah Devon White was the first guy that forced it and then cleaned up a hardened key at the end of it Devon the wood is so good at timing some of the snap and hitting at full speed he's leaning at the snap and look at him get in there that offensive line is trying to rub off on him he's really hard to get to it was a loss of a yard so they're deeper of their own end zone from the two second and 11 stead of the throw gonna go long it's incomplete intended for Darius Layton Monroe and Jackson were back there again the lack of the intermediate passes it seems like every since the beginning of this football game it's been deep Falls and nothing else from Auburn they've got to get to the 13 yard line for a first down and if it wasn't hard on Jarrett Stidham to here on that last play it will be here play clock winding down they didn't get it off by a lot frustrated Gus Malzahn yeah it's it's not the biggest penalty in the world no they're still going to be eight yards of their own play clock expired delay a game you mean if here's a quarterback on this one if you're not sure you don't feel good you know no use hurting it it's a now everything's got to be perfect though snap the whole thing third and 12 from the one scrambling gotta get out of that engine Devon white porta taina this LSU defense has to be proud of their effort ever since the first quarter you know they fell behind they were in shock early but since then they have controlled this football game against Auburn offense this is not going to be an easy spot for a true freshman to punt now and guess who's going to get it number seven last time after the kick threw a punt return for a touchdown he almost shaked it that was a 23 yard or the last time now he's on his own end line to pick the tallywacker in a charcoal 45 great field position in Auburn territory LSU takes over last play on defense forced the putt LSU only trailing by 2 was six for me to go Alabama's got a date with Arkansas a little bit later Auburn wanting to stay there at 4 and oh but that's very much in doubt right now because the oneonone LSU Tigers have the ball at the Auburn 45 yard line well they know they neither a quarterback and even the freshmen are going to the 60 or seniors and go we believe in your man go get it done day we'll get it done let's see if they can great Starling spot they Auburn 45 it's Carter that H back in motion various guys tried to jump over the top of Darryl Williams and couldn't talked about these guys as wide receivers DJ charkh is the flash they call Russell gage the Black Panther Danny Etling is a green arrow and it all started with John battle who was Batman so they got their own Justice League going John battled that played a lot today because he was injured the Green Arrow better shoot a couple straight arrows here does he do that I'm not sure he does let's see what he's got in his quiver that's jargon come back the other way straight ahead with guys barbar but he got about four out of it out of the five I think that Canada may be secondguessing himself the last time remember after shark catch down there to the what 35 40 yard line he's called Matt did three straight pass plays got a sack incomplete incomplete out of field goal range this time he's come back with backtoback runs now what do you do on third down field goal would give them the lead but again and their longest field goal here's 4045 yeah so they're a little bit limited in that area and that guy knows it Throwdown at 5:00 that leg is gonna bring me Derek Dylan emotion two dice in the flat can he beat Williams he hit his head down I got a first down remember when we circled dice before I'm not the only one that's sought Matt Canada had to tell Danny Etling the next time we call this play I want you to drop it off to guys and see if he can make a first down it's did was that collision same look two receivers running a combo pattern to the wide side of the field throw it out two guys they didn't use the motion but it was the same exact play over 200 yards now the air 4:42 go down just inside the Auburn 35 instead nice again he's down to the 28 follow JD more number 18 and you got a positive play JD Martin little poor bags little H back at that time he got to the second level and guys got to the second level you saw Connor call Foreman up on the net over there on the sidelines right now they'd like to use about four minutes and get a touch back another one of those lastsecond plays right yep just a second earlier than last year both time ends plus Stefan Sullivan but it's guys that's it four minutes that was a great play by Jeff Holland that time he did from the his left side just beat his fanning out in there before guys could get started it's great at a 45yard field goal here right now third down and three Darryl Williams comes in guys goes out there's Connor cult trying to have to think about it can't take a sack can't take a penalty you got to remind everybody and it looks like they might have to take a timeout they will we will as well 325 remaining the LSU Tigers at home trailing by two let's take a look at the GMC game changer we got a couple game changers both wide receivers Russell gage for one this diving catch sensational touchdown absolutely and then his counterpart the flash PJ Chuck Darryl shark jr. number seven is good ever at a 75 yards on the punt return for the touchdown we are a two point game with 325 to play what a big play is how do you do it you let Danny Etling run here he's close just now what a call here you know if you make a first down you're going to take at least LS Auburn's three timeouts away from them but a field goal wins the game you don't have the greatest field goal kicker and that's why you're making the big bucks they're gonna go whew they're gonna go for it I'm saying no change their mind they've gone back and forth here comes Connor Culp it's less than the length of a football the redshirt freshman from Phoenix Arizona can be the hero of the day if he hits the kick and then the lead holds up clock going down take your time if you're gonna kick a field goal here you don't want to be rushed Connor gets to think about it for another minute so do we that's how close it is you can see the marker on the far sideline you see where the tip for the football is at the 25 Connor Culp 42yard field goal attempt his longest as Gary mentioned earlier this year is 45 for the LSU lead for Colt brannad practice Thursday they probably simulated seven or eight twominute drives where it had to end in a field goal I will say this they all got closer there were only 25 yarders this one was way more pressure and I think there were five people watching not 80,000 or whatever it is here and their quarterback says Santa Maura Connor it'll be the smallest big man on campus tonight if the lead holder now that LSU defense has pitched two and a half quarters of great defense can they finish off this game Auburn obviously all three timeouts ah nerds got all their timeouts Jared Stidham in this half one of six for six yards too many people's not enough easy throws Gambel's kick with the adrenaline flowing all the way out of the back of the end zone now remember a year ago it came down to one tick on the clock and this was it headling trying to get the play off the clock had expired they didn't know that at the time he rolls close to the end zone it's signaled touchdown when you go back you can tell as you look at the play clock out of time before the snap now it's Jared Stidham and the Auburn Tiger offense they only need a field goal to come back to win 236 all their time actually play action quick swing pass Devon Barrett that hammers as soon as he caught it how about Craig's grant outfit number nine he gave up that early touchdown he's a big guy sixfoot to 200 some pounds comes up and lays second down at 10:00 sharp Lawrence back in the game number 90 playing on 1 April basic trick didn't play action to Johnson that level does he not going to poll and it's incomplete intended for Cannella the Titans Devon white times out just the late blitz and lays out the quarterback if you want to play quarterback this is what it is I was gonna feel that one until Thursday and all Devon white did was to lay a half a second allowed for the center to turn and then he hit at full speed third and ten here comes a blitz it's picked up around let's do a notice but it's incomplete Slayton couldn't hold it remember they got all three timeouts you have to punt the ball here wouldn't have been a first down had a caught it no potato contoured of any con and I'll tell you that oh man they're going to take a timeout now which almost declares that they got to go for it I thought for sure they would cut think about that nessip they catch that past its fourth and one bright beta gone for it they're going to go for it fourth and ten they've declared their strategy here we told you to combat a crazy finish Brad called it the Blitz was picked up inside ball is slightly outside but should have been caught Slayton does not come up with it that would have put him in a fourth and one here's the ball game you go to Hastings Hastings in the slide number 33 right there fourth and 10 look like things are moving on the line still steps in steps out trying to find an open man fires deep broken up by Dante Jackson LSU takes over our downs nothing was there he felt the clock ticking had to get out of the pocket one throw downfield and Jackson makes the play if LSU runs the ball here our bird should let him score we talked about that last week and that's should have been the strategy in the Florida game remember if LSU runs the ball they should let him score if they run it down and take a knee bring guys down after they'll get the ball back with about 45 seconds another timeout 90 seconds left in Death Valley the home fields been pretty good to LSU against Auburn for a long time eight straight the Auburn Tigers look like they were in control earlier this game remember this LSU has a play and if they get up first down they take a knee they do not want to score nice got about three they talked about it with us Friday that if we make a first down we instruct our back to fall down big day to day and maybe it's not maybe it's just a normal day in a normal place with normal crawfish prepared thirtysix ways maybe today you'll make that breakthrough and maybe tonight you'll break through two maybe it'll rang it maybe you'll shine or today could just be one of those days for the unpredictable and the unencumbered at LSU maybe counts for a little something extra maybe absolutely over and out of timeouts it's a third down and four coming up LSU often they don't make the first down LSU will have a fourth down call with approximately 40 seconds to go in the game Daria's guys has been the guy to handle it on each of these snaps on this Drive we'll handle it again middle of that pack got back to the line of scrimmage and that's it for town so if you let it if you're LSU now you'll end up riding down as far as you can you take your time out you got to kick the field goal you can't allow Carlson to beat you with a long field goal at the end we get down we go under a minute and write about a robbery sink in the other the 19 yard line happily taking his time looking to the sideline hit on will call timeout with one second to go standing right with the official one second ago in 42 on the game clock twenty four twenty three forty two ticks left count up tonight on CBS begins with MacGyver and NCIS Los Angeles followed by a new initiative 48 hours tonight's only CBS a feeling maybe MacGyver was a kicker in college so how about the decisions that endures Iran is made down the stretch here remember he passed up a 54yard field go unpunished that put the ball in the 2 yard line then he came back and kicked the 42 yarder with a foot to go to take the lead and now he's got his team in position to make it a fourpoint lead it has managed this perfectly if the ball goes between the uprights Josh crowding the hole johner cult to try to tack on three more his last one was 42 this is a 36yard field goal attempt good again that much closer to the big man on campus perfect execution from the snap just a little bit long below head high second kick in her own right down the pipe and the reaction from the redshirt freshman nothing to this so 27 23 38 seconds for Auburn and no timeouts we're looking at each other it's 20 to nothing and we're thinking how can LSU get back in this game how could they possibly score 27 points I think we were thinking too right and they they did it with big place and you know that was I think would shock the Auburn defense the most in a couple of big plays the jet sweep when they were not in position with her safety a three yard hitch route that goes for 40 yards right plays Eric Brown was the Auburn player down and he's up and going off the LSU defense stepped up they sure did I mean you caught Jarrett's stenum 2 for 10 in the second half for 6 yards and of those 10 attempts eight of them had to be more than 25 or 30 yards downhill Hardin he put some pressure on Devon white made another million tackles Rashad Lawrence toughen it out all those guys are the LSU defense had a part in this and our gamble will kick Ryan Davis city life stove weight back at the 5yard line gamble nailed the last one out of the back of the end zone and you know do it again I work from the 25 down for if they need to touch through there's the numbers Gary was talking about it was a lot easier the last time they had the ball all they needed to do was get to about the 35 yard line to win the game this time they had all three timeouts this time they got nothing and they got to go the whole length 75 yards away in 38 seconds Stidham look at IV people behind cinemas gonna take off down it's a big first down there clock stops to move the chains wait didn't started holy cow Barbara's going to be upset with that that any fires broken up intended for Hastings Dante Jackson they're cost them about six seconds on that play by not stopping the clock sixteen seconds remaining first down is called a single timeout the clock never stops two or three plays maybe depends acquits fires under pressure broken up again by Dante Jackson I say a friend is not playing prevent I'll tell you that right now he is coming after the quarterback he's playing man the man behind it one free safety but they're coming Adams coming around the side Cory Thompson this time is the guy that puts a pressure damping away from the inside they're giving him two and a half seconds and he has to throw the ball eleven seconds left here they come again there's and Jackson almost had an interception it would have been a touchdown well that's the second well this interception actually isn't as big as the last one that was dropped by us it cost him seven points this one would have clinched the game obviously remember when we said earlier it hasn't been a good 24 hours for cat's ninth ranked Cougars of Washington State loss last night second ranked Tigers of Clemson loss last night the numbers 10 Tigers of Auburn have won get back here and the 10th ranked Tigers fall as well now the Auburn Tigers still looking for their first win at Tiger Stadium this century has now won over the fans who just two weeks ago we're calling for his and the athletic directors head just two weeks ago since then they knocked on Florida on the road in a top 10 team Auburn at home down 20 points and now it's LSU in the thick of things in the West because they're 2 &amp; 1 five and two Danny Etling is keeping that one remember this though authors still controls their destiny as well Alys with a winning coach coach congratulations on the win first walk us through under three minutes you're driving you're down to what are you telling your coaches in this team just continue to do we dawn we're gonna win the game we felt like we were gonna live the game the whole second half what a great team win I can't think there was a difference in the second half how emotional is this win coach that's good after being down 20 nothing this team fought they did what you asked them to do they give up on their first SEC loss what do they prove to these fans into you I'm just so proud about just our fans enough there's one team one heartbeat what a great win for the Tigers you're outstanding you scored the touchdown that brought this team within two what did your mentality have to be to overcome that 20point deficit the guys know how hard we work we came out we've been in in spots worse than this before and we just wanted to show that we can do it on thick well a lot of guys counters out we never County none of us out and guy helped us out and all glory goes hell this has been a different team since that loss to Troy what did you say to each other as teammates as brothers I mean you know we lost the Mississippi State and it was like oh yeah you know they have SEC team then we lose to Shore and we knew that we the guys that came before her before they would accept that and we know we don't want to be the guys to let those guys down it's a brotherhood here and so we all got together we gutted it out and this heart we got to play for now you had a moment with Brandon LaFell on the sidelines he gave you some advice then you go out and score the touchdown what did he tell you and did that hype you up then he was just telling me whenever big players come to come from our room that receiver room and like I said those guys come back it's a tradition and for him to talk to me and I was just hyped up and you know God did whatever was next congratulations on the win thank you so the man that caught a touchdown pass it was a second too late last year is the hero today one of the many heroes for the LSU Tigers DJ shark the man they call the flash and that leads us to our play the game presented by NAPA Auto Parts and DJ spinning a pretty good play here on a 75 yard punt return got the edge then got to the far sideline and said we'll see you all later here's a call from Chris Blair Marshalls punt in the air chart coming up now backpedaling fields it at the 25 near side now goes to the far side of the field has some blockers in front of him he's to the 40 45 down the far sideline one of the many heroes number 7 DJ charkha anything the players aren't loved in the last couple of weeks John battle hugging his head coach coach Oh dating back to 1949 this is the biggest comeback by LSU against an SEC opponent in Tiger Stadium yeah and you could amplify that by opponent who was a top ten team that everybody was thinking is right in the hunt for it I know they're still alive but what a comeback when a couple of weeks ago they weren't exactly the toast of Baton Rouge they are now aren't they",

  "transcript": "Michael Badgley will kick it deep and Derwin James and Keith Gavin are the return men James have touchdowns home back last week but they keep it away from him and here's Gavin for FSU and he's passed the 25 to the 26 yard line so James Blackmon true freshman quarterback from just north of Miami and Belle Glade the first true freshman quarterback to start for Florida State since 1985 chip Ferguson was the quarterback been and Mark Richt was a ga at Florida State that Rick does not coached in this venue since he was the offensive coordinator back in 2000 James Blackmon was a year all done and they run the ball on first down past the 35 yard line tempo spectryx go go near the Miami 40 way to start the game appear normal 35 yards establish the line of scrimmage is the first priority for this Florida State offense they come out heavy formation heavy set big personnel and take the fight right to the Hurricanes to start this game that trick a junior from Orlando and 100 yards last week here's a swing pass tonight from Murray able to stay inbounds and pushed out after a game about three on the play you've watched a lot of tape on Blackman what have you seen so far did some things really well last week in their win he looks like a freshman some really good moments but also some moments that leave you scratching your head he's trying to make sure that there aren't as many peaks and valleys just be more consistent throughout the ballgame again you saw only 121 yards last week but had the play of the game Jimbo Fisher told us he's picking things up quickly though for a true freshman on second and seven Blackman pumps throws into traffic it's knocked away incomplete well James Blackman the young freshman quarterback out of Glades Central High School Belle Glade Florida that's in South Florida now that's Miami territory and this is a program that routinely produces NFL talent year in and year out but they haven't produced quarterbacks this is going to be the first time we've seen a major contender at the quarterback position at a power fire school I played central bright future for this young man see how he does here Tom and third down and seven at the 37 yard line of Miami forced out of the pocket an excellent job by Miami downfield bubbling and then Jeff Thomas chasing black men out of play it's fourth down now they do have a kicker and Ricky equai oh who can kick it this far the question is do you want to do that in your first possession the upon how do you go for on fourth and seven he's keeping the offense on the field at least give it some time to think about it I punt and play field position at this point certainly don't want to give Miami opportunistic field positions wide punt allow my great defense to take the field against an inexperienced quarterback in Miami backed up hopefully if in fact this punt lands in a good spot for the Noles so the problem here is Florida State two too much time they're gonna have to burn a timeout or they just take the penalty delay a game here give him five more yards to work with offense by God now Logan Tyler has struggled this year Florida State is near the bottom in net punting but he did have a big one last week against Wake where he pinned the Demon Deacons inside the 10 and that's obviously what they're asking him to do here plum fells when you have an opening drive like you've had here he doesn't have to be an exceptional punter now because he's got a short field to punt into all he's got to do is ensure that Miami stays backed up Braxton Barrios is the deep man Barrios lets it go over his head it checks up about the four yard line great job by Logan Tyler the sophomore Miami quarterback Malik brazier from Mobile Alabama is for no as a starter takes over for Brad kya now to those wins were against Duke and what was in that crazy crazy eight lateral game two years ago but last week against Duke he was upstanding he did have a pick but at two touchdown passes almost three hundred yards through the air he also ran for a score it's his athleticism that really adds a new dimension to mark Rick's office he's got a great security blanket standing next to a mark it is wolf healthy's been battling an ankle injury all season we'll find out here Walton to the ten yard line a little bit of room gain of close to seven on the play ROS ears mom Dana Hudson is here along with stepfather Ron Hudson making the sixhour trek from Miami that sunny skies here never expected that they almost move this game again because of another hurricane as well as here's pass is deflected incomplete he was trying to set up the screen and boy he almost threw a pick six outstanding job by Josh sweat number nine you'll see he's looping around he sees that Rozier is going to drop into a screen type of drop Rozier decides to throw a missile a fastball instead of trying to float it over the top good play by the defender needed a changeup picnic or a knuckleball anything over the top Josh sweat six six hard to get it over that outstretched are 23 where the swallowed by DeMarcus Christmas it all started with that great punt pending the Hurricanes deep and now they got to kick it out of their own end and Tavares McFadden very dangerous with a football in his hands and a true freshman punter and Zach fievel's your honor with his nerves are like right now kicking in this rivalry for the first time and he almost got that blocked terrific punt goes out of bounds around the 43 it's a 48 yard food for Fiegel rivalries are all about passion and emotion you see the big fella Christmas Bible rematch up brought to you by Wendy 60 second meeting in Miami leads by one win Florida State has won the last seven going back to 2009 the last three games decided by a total of 10 points including a one point win for FSU last year on a blocked extra point Santa will start this drive from their 44 yard line swing pass to Keith Gavin and it's a six yard gain to midfield James Blackmon has had some great moments but he's also had some frustrating times here he is last week this is a simple screen pass to the right hand side this is a JV junior varsity throw and this throw right here the exact next play the next play this is an NFL throw between two defenders cover two he fits it in there somehow this kid's got bigtime arm just got to get more consistent Patrick trying to find a hole and it's not there wrapped up by Demetrius Jackson for a loss well fellows this offense requires a quarterback to do a lot and I think there's three things you got to pay attention to today number one down and distance an area of the field James Blackman has to know where he's at what his line to gain is and then he's got to be able to communicate the place coming in from the sideline personnel groupings formation shifts motions and then after all that's done why identify and then again get his team set up watch the communication between him and his football team prior to each and every snap you're seeing it right now third and five black men in trouble gets hit a couple of times and finally goes down a sack back at the 42 yard line Hendrick North was there for the Canes among the top teams defensively in every category in particular tackles for loss number two pressure off the right hand side McCloud coming in he gets picked up which frees up Shaq quarterman the sophomore star at middle linebacker to add to the pressure Blackmun just has no chance to get rid of the football it results in a big sack for the Canes defense Tyler Barrios lets us one go and it does not check up this time it goes into the end zone for a touchback 57yard punt but only a 37yard net is kendrick Norton he using Blackmun's leg to play the guitar what's up with that football is presented by PlayStation View watch the biggest moments in sports try it free today a hurricane Irma Rex so much havoc on the South seemed like a football game was so trivial the game originally was set for September 16th but because of the hurricane they rescheduled the game both teams were off for about three weeks it was like starting training camp again and actually thought about moving this game again because of another hurricane hurricane Nate but we actually have sunny skies there's a little bit of rain in the forecast perhaps for towards the end of the game but that hurricane is moving west they were thinking about moving this game either to fly a night or to noon here's a pass play Rozier completing it near the 30yard line to the tight end Chris earned it last year Mark Richt had a home coming to Miami going back taking a head coaching job we played quarterback look at all the guys that he was around back at the U but he was at Florida State for 15 years including winning a couple of national championships as Miami runs the ball does not get the first down I'll be third and short but Rick's last time in this stadium was 2000 the year after Bobby bond won his second National Championship what a job he's done with Miami his approval rating right now ninetyfive percent at RADA quarterback sneak here Rozier on third down and a timeout was called it appears prior the snap timeout by Mark Pryor to the ball B and snack time out my anak Wayne heat is our referee third and one when we come back the fourth ever night game at Ann Arbor and it's a rivalry game Michigan Michigan State 7:30 Eastern on ABC midway through the start of the first quarter this rivalry contests 60 second meeting third one Miami sea is in the game big number 65 Cory gainer Rozier rolling out falls hi Herndon suppressor by Brian burns and Rozier couldn't complete what seemed like an easy pickup for the first down got to make that throw again Malik Rozier it's a great play call by Mark Richt little food action we have the back up offensive lineman and pull back from the states you have Florida State they can run you just can't connect on the pass fee goes first punt almost 50 yards out of his own end zone he's back here is 15 yard line here at 4th and 1 and this is not a good kick McFadden letting it bounce but it takes several hops inside the Florida State 20yard line a 53yard punt so changed Blackmon back out there at quarterback he's in for DeAndre Francois here is where he got injured against Alabama week 1 seasonending knee injury and Francois the ACC Rookie of the Year in 2016 he was going to make a play for Player of the Year in the conference in 2017 you expected huge growth from him this year just so unfortunate to see his season cut short there in the opener against Alabama but you know he's hungry he's prepping and rehabbing and when he gets healthy again it's gonna be very fun to live so you got the true freshman in there instead at quarterback it's six five one hundred and sixty nine pounds that's what he's listed at he completes it here to Patrick to the twenty five picking up six yards now they've hit three good first down plays so far offensively but they just haven't been able to complete those drives finish him off with points and they haven't really taken in these shots down the field trying to work James Blackmon into this game playing get him some confidence early before you start to stretch his arm one of these days though they're got to take a shot downfield Miami daring him to do that stack on the box with eight guys they try to run into that eightman flat packs are gonna play professor he's got home it's a backwards quarterback and in the Miami territory lifts up a 30yard run on the first drive that one goes for 30 again 39 officially this is all because number 22 right there Sheldrick Redwine he loses contain nothing there inside he loses track got around the edge on the lefthand side he got to be smart when going against these heavy sets that Florida State will throw at you twentynine check that officially on the run first down at the 45 yard line and this time it is the true freshman cam akers and he is tackled for a loss of five on the play Molina young and run support from his cornerback spot little corner cat off the edge there huh Greg yeah I'll bring it they'll bring it yeah Manny Diaz defensively the defensive coordinator for Miami he preaches chaos chaos chaos and disruption he'll bring pressures from all over the place safeties corners linebackers on any down in distance anything's possible you've got to keep your head on a swivel as a quarterback he's another former Seminole he was coaching at Florida State as a ga Blackman throws incomplete trying to hit Gavin Shelby third down and 15 under C Jimbo Fisher on the sidelines gesturing to James Blackman about ball placement that ball was coming out of his hand a hundred miles an hour and it goes back to what you touched on on the last Drive Greg you got to have some nuance to your throws can't be JB one snap Marcia the next he'll learn every snap has a new opportunity this young man is going to be fun to watch as he grows over the years third and 15 to downfield and it's tipped at the line as Blackman got kicked Michael Jackson will cut off the corner welcome to passive defense number 28 that's a huge play obviously for Florida State there as they were going to be off the field offensively absolutely can't do it if you're Michael Jackson that's the easiest call that official will make all day clearly the ball is gone it's tipped at the line of scrimmage by Demetrius Jackson well played defensively you're off the field especially on third and 15 and then you give the Noles a fresh set of downs you can't do that against quality competition I know it's a rivalry game you're jacked up to play you got to hold your water you just hurt your team first out at the 35 and kids running ran four black men with ties to the 22 yard line 13yard pickup see number 34 on the end of the line of scrimmage he runs down with the zone read fake which allows nothing but green grass to the outside for Blackmon Charles Perry took the cheese and allows the true freshman to get out with some free space well done he doesn't run it often but when he does you got to be decisive north and south at the 24 yard line now his title handle hook the left side goes Patrick stop Chris Patrick running all over this Miami defense so far the third big carry for Patrick and it's a game about twelve this running game is starting the feel itself after last week they played a couple great run defenses an NC State and Alabama now they are starting to see some opportunities up front in the run game they got to continue to commit to it Patrick again 235 pounds between the tackles gets to on the plate joke Jackson on the stop Greg you've got to be impressed with the Florida State offensive line to this point this is a unit that has been subject to much criticism both internally and publicly and they're going against the defensive front seven with Miami those three linebackers Michael Pinkney and Shaquille quarterman and Zack McLeod they have not been able to make plays and get off the secondlevel blocks and up front Tom they were banged up after last week three guys Derek Kelly Landon Dickerson and Cole minshew all a little bit beat up after the Wake Forest game answering the call now playaction Blackmon looking ends I've got a man that he overthrow the intended receiver Knight Quan Murry new knee as they call him got free in the back of the end zone maybe the nerves got to Blackmon on the throw he Adam he did and the windows get tighter as you get close to the end zone and Blackmon they're gonna come after them every single snap this Miami defense is aggressive they're physical and they're trying to affect the quarterback Blackman has to be more accurate in the red zone when the windows are small on the time hi Ted Thomas said you're true fresh I'm gonna just drive your helmet into the ground make you think twice when I come at you next time little gamesmanship happens in a rivalry game of course 3rd and 8th and they're gonna keep it on the ground with Patrick interesting call there it's got a show that Jim Fisher doesn't trust Blackman yet and also maybe he expects this to be a lowscoring game right I mean why else would you just hand it off there and third that you just don't trust your quarterback and you run it to the middle of the field to to make the field goal a little bit more makeable for Aguayo who's been ice water throughout the course of his career for the most part tell you what Greg is you've won the field position battle get points while you're on a short field 27 yard attempt for Aguayo made his last eight kicks when it's on the money and Florida State with the early lead and as a star the running back for Miami you see him going through the pregame working that right ankle no problems and then you get to the left angle not quite the same look he's been banged up to this point of the season still been very productive but he hasn't been quite as explosive or powerful as he was a year ago we'll keep an eye on that left ankle and see if it affects him moving forward throughout this game he's number two in the country in yards per carry in number five nationally in yards rushing overall 403 Florida State strikes first with a short field goal by a glioma now touch back Miami will start on the 25 as we check in with that hamburger all right Adnan and then up said earlier today in the top five of Oklahoma going down at home Florida State trying to upset Miami the Seminoles have won seven straight in the series a lot of people saying it not now when for Miami along talking with Jimbo Fisher yesterday we asked him is this the best Miami team he faced he said no he said they've been pretty much to see in the last several years and if Mark was not a hundred percent they're definitely not the best team that Fisher's played against and his tenure wolves on the sidelines here and they dumped the pass off to Jeff Thomas a true freshman lined up in the backfield and the Seminoles are all over that well they might be given mark Walton just a bit of a rest here and to follow up with Greg on that ankle injury it wasn't an ankle twist wasn't ligament or tendon related he actually got hit so it's more of a bone bruise type situation where he's dealing with pain tolerance so they'll continue to work Jeff Thomas young freshman and Travis Homer as you see in there right now number 24 next to Rozier oh my gammit 80 yards a carry so he's had a good start to the year so far McFadden coming on the Blitz was here going downfield and it's incomplete Lawrence KJ went up high for that one couldn't pull it in with Levante Taylor in coverage it'll be third and 10 if you're Rozier you love the matchup cager it's six foot five Taylor just a hair over 510 he had a chance at it it's a good no call to buy the official some contact but I think it was well within the rules he's got to make that catch Greg you have to if you're a city up five receiver and you're giving out that much down with those contestant catches we're gonna fat to creepin up on the line again now he backs off and Florida State was offside free play here for Miami Rozier throws complete to Barrios he doesn't get the first down so they'll take the penalty here and it'll be third down and five McFadden was almost offside on second down his tie Memphis he was definitely in the neutral zone on the snap off defense number third down yeah you can see right here at the end of the line of scrimmage very obvious that he's in the neutral zone Joshua visual yeah Charles Kelly the deep coordinator for FSU you need eyes up here on 35 the Darren James lined up over the wall late now standing up there goes here another shot down the field and Barrios trying to get there the defender those first and breaks up the pass incomplete AJ Westbrook Carlos Becker in coverage as well you don't see plays like this in the secondary every week we go to games all the time and it's rare to see that kind of range Barrios is working on a corner route running away from the free safety AJ Westbrook flies over the top and showcases worldclass speed unbelievable play how about this Greg Miami's flown a second time out of here the first quarter nice it'll be fourth down and five we'll see what Miami does imagine they're funding you're not sure why Mark Richt called the time up now any surprises so far this one no not so far I've been very impressed by Florida State trying to commit to the run game and not putting James Blackmun in a difficult situation you see them getting in fullback tight ends multiple tight ends and running downhill right at this Miami team they haven't been tested yet and Miami so far in the first quarter having a difficult time containing the run game for the Seminoles you think it's fair to say that Miami season starts now everybody knows to know are the Canes back there defense looks so good against Duke and all respect to Duke but it's still Duke and the offense though not quite there and we're seeing that today they haven't seen personnel like this they've seen good well coached football team in Toledo and against Duke very well coached executed a high level but they haven't seen NFL talent across the board like Florida State has I'm having some issues again getting lined up here McFadden under this one signaling and it's fair caught at the 30yard line 45 yard punt earlier today we celebrated Lee Corsos 300 head gear selection and he'll over the Horned Frogs who are play in West Virginia the former Florida State quarterback Lee Corso through the years has picked Florida State 19 times he's picked seven mighty naming wins he's two and three alltime picking this game what a treasure we love you coach Florida State back on offense black men wide open in the middle of the field for a first down light his oh the tight end just his fourth catch of the season and it's a gain of 17 just a simple little smash snag flat route it's a nice easy progression for James Blackmon and a good job by Izzo sliding inside giving his quarterback some room and a good call by Randy Sanders Jimbo Fisher they'll go back to the ground here and it is a curse a trick question staying in bounds and lowering the bull a flat comes in pushing and shoving per usual between these two teams red wine got lit up like a Cabernet on that wall penalty on Florida State for that hit it's by acres well they better not guys if that if they call targeting on acres right there that would be egregious there's no way I mean acres was out of bounds but what's he supposed to do the defenders coming flying Adam that's what I think they might be looking at is whether or not it's a late hit out of balance he was tightrope on the sidelines I don't think you can call it if that's what they call here I'll be just hot baby I mean red wine him he's already there is no foul on a play for a late hit play yeah that was a bangbang play there's Kim Akers left foot went out of bounds it was within a yard or a step when red wine actually made the hit or should I say when cam akers front made the hit red wine the converted corner not the biggest safety in the world he felt the boom on that one already 92 yards of the ground for Florida State mixing Patrick and acres from the 41 of the canes here's playaction Blackman on the rollout and he throws it away he wanted to take a shot down the field to keep Gavin but it was an excellent read by the safety Jaquan Johnson to get back there as Gavin was streaking down the numbers so far on first and 10 we've seen Jimbo Fisher throw the ball a number of times they run it a couple but it's been all about picking up yards through the air on early downs and they've been successful to this point behind the sticks now on second and 10 he'll give it to acres try to cut it back and acres to the 37 yard line Robert Knowles on the stop pick up a four on first down acres lost his helmet he's got to come out for a play tell you what acres is showing more physicality today than I have seen from him in the first three games usually he's trying to balance everything to the outside today he's lowering his shoulder and delivering some blows you see why he was one of the toprated recruits in the country at the running back position Tom at number one ranked running back who was a fouryear starter at quarterback so he's had a lot to learn in his hip transition here in year one so chuck was Patrick replaces Akers here third down and six Blackmon and the receiver didn't turn in time until Gavin by the time he turned around the ball was there and he couldn't hang on fourth down it's a great job by James Blackmun anticipating the throw it's in the air right now look at it balls halfway there before Gavin turns around that's a well thrown football Gavin's got to come up with it and good coverage too that throws a half second later it could have been broken up we're practice on Thursday he had two or three drops Tyler's been good punting so far and Barrios again the deep man and here to stay able to keep it from going into the end zone but that nazareth een was down there for FSU or are they saying a touchback and saying it's a touchback that it crossed the plane that's where the ball is not the man and they're rolling it across the plane it's a touchback comes out to the 20 wow that was close they're gonna have to take another look at that I would imagine that's a huge play so hard to tell though right a replay and when it crosses there they have to have indisputable video evidence I would think that they would take a peek at it or at least a half second look but remember it has to show that indisputable video evidence on the replay to overturn it so first out for Miami on its 20yard line Marthe Walton is back in and he gets the call here off the left side he lowers his shoulder and runs over Westbrook he's 200 pounds mark walden able to lower the shoulder there and pick up five yards and that's the type of run right there where that left ankle will be tested he's running from right to left Connor run in a loop that left ankle is going to be tested on those perimeter runs to the left looked just fine on that one there's wolf again trying to fight a hole it's not there good job up front by Florida State it'll give them a yard so third down coming up Miami's got to start making some hay on third down Greg they have just been abysmal getting the ball past the yard to gain and they haven't been able to complete any passes down field on third down they're in a tough spot right now they've gotten crushed from a field position standpoint their average drive starts do their own 17 third down Jalen Wilkerson is hurt for Florida State the ESPN app is a fans best friend stream every ESPN and ABC college football game live at home or on the go scores news highlights ESPN M has it all and it's been such a great tool in September gets even better in October and then as we move into November check out all the games the surprises hitting Oklahoma's win earlier today again a loss rather earlier today at home against Iowa State so while we have a moment with I'm tending to Wilkerson let's check in with that man of the studio ednan Greg Tom it really looks like notre dame's about to start rolling their offense has really gotten going even with Lambert winbush not playing today yeah they're much better team than North Carolina but Notre Dame we're gonna learn who they are in the second half of the season their first six games relatively manageable their next six it's on a whole nother level we'll be facing a lot of ACC foes that are outstanding and very well regarded in the second half of the season including a game at the you know vember eleven third and four for Miami some movement up from no flag Rozier trying to pick it up on his feet and he's able to get the first down this game here in 2017 we thought would be all about defense and that's the story through one quarter in Tallahassee play nothing Florida State Zess full it has to run a football it did not in that first quarter in fact 24 yards total for the Hurricanes Florida State had 124 had the ball for over ten minutes but only three points so that's disappointing if you're a Seminole fan meanwhile Malik Rozier making his fifth career start for Miami just got a first down with his feet from the 32 Walton again can't find a hole able to get back to the line of scrimmage no gain Brian burns on the stop Taco Bell a proud partner the college football playoff be on the lookout for Taco Bell student sections and passionate fans like these at games all season long just being around Tallahassee the last couple of days we've seen a lot of houses divided we saw this today at breakfast several married couples one well the Seminole outfit and the other the you send a coverage come on Richard toilet top young receivers in college football picks up close to fifteen on the plate just his fourth catch of the year because he missed the first two games of the season with a hamstring injury yeah they need to get him involved you see early in the second quarter say we got to get our stars going we got Walton going a little bit we got to get Rozier dialed in in the passing game then let's find 82 for a couple plays back to the ground again nothing for a wolf able to stretch forward and get maybe two they need to keep finding I'm on Richards number 82 because that Tommy was lined up against number eight Stanford Samuels who they really like but he's just a true freshman and that is not a Mitch madness of a matchup the Florida State wants to be in all day on defense and now he's going to be going to the other side that's right there you go against VARs McFadden that's one of that day Warner's in the game I think semantics we may be seen for a lot of years to come it's impression coming on the left side here at the next level both guys considered prospects rose ears past there is contact before the ball arrived by Florida State pass was intended for cager Samuel is a true freshman looked like he got there before the ball but no flat yeah trying to work a little bit of an in route and there was a little contact the receiver a little ginger coming out of the twopager he's got a burst across on that end breaker and allow his quarterback some space to work bad route where is here who is named the starting quarterback 11 days before the opener and third and long Wow that was ugly I don't know what happened there during James Trapp did it's incomplete that came out of his hand fawning for town this is one of those where Rozier looking at his wide receivers I got him I got him I got him oh wait number three no try to pull the trigger you see he's just kind of tries to stop himself from letting go of it the ball dies like a sinker which does that was on a yoyo string Greg to tell you what that happened as though even some of the best ones get fooled in coverage here's fee goes to pot and they've gotten block they've gotten tip there it works out well rolls down near the 12 yard line the 39 yard punt Brian Burns who already blocked the punt this year the second time in his career may have gotten a piece of that one all right Adnan here in Tallahassee it is 3nothing Florida State you see Miami with just 40 yards of total offense Seminoles with their first drive of the second quarter starting from their 12 yard line and here's Gavin on the pitch past the 15 for about four border states done a great job on the ground at this point but Miami defensively look at their two linebackers Michael Pinkney Jack quarterman number 55 they're extremely aggressive and they found themselves getting out of position on multiple plays which allowed big runs for the Florida State offense they got to be more disciplined and fit the gap a little tighter than they all right now on second and six they hand it off Miami has fall over that one excellent job upfront by Kendrick Norton Trent Harris taking down the running back jacquez Patrick for no gain on the play Florida State's had a lot of success on first down but second down and third down have been a bit of a problem to this point now the longer the thirddown gets the more difficult obviously it is to convert especially when you got a true freshman his third and five let's see how he handles this you're asked to do a lot as a quarterback in this offense and down goes the quarterback Blackmon as Demetrius Jackson sacks him back at the 5yard line the ball may have come out it did but it was recovered by Florida State 11yard loss they're gonna have to punt on their end zone time and time again you've seen this group from Miami really do a great job affecting the passer they go with a twist on the right side but on the left side Demetrius Jackson goes oneonone against number 69 landon Dickerson and beats him with relative ease resulting in the sack they've done such a good job getting after the passer and making plays in the backfield and Florida State's struggled with it headsup play by the right tackle Rick Leonard jumping on that loose ball back at the 4 yard line excellent caught Barrios backing up from the 43 and Barrios got a loser I'll take him down back at the 33 yard line by nazareth ii a penalty flag is strong late though and a lot of long discussions by the official so far before announcements we saw him pick up a flag earlier on what the officials initially were to call a late hit see if they pick up the flag again during the return personal foul face mask number eight of the receiving team 15yard penalty first down you almost never see that Barrios the return man is called for a face mask after a 52 yard punt this is going to put the ball back close to the 30yard line see Barrios there with the left hand in the grille of Nazareth Dean call for the penalty goodbye contributing to participating universities general scholarship funds for each fieldgoal an extra point kicked today allstate has contributed millions in scholarship funds Miami coming in averaging 237 yards per game on the ground but just 17 yards so far and a 73yard clip of the field after a great punt by Florida State plus the facemask on the return man Braxton Barrios and that puts the ball from Miami 21 malik Rozier the junior quarterback going to keep it here and he's spun down for a loss at the 20 yard line as we check into that now all right so how much now the big 12 playoff hopes on the shoulders of TCU or is it way too early to even have that discussion it's too early don't count Oklahoma out yet second down and 11 over the middle it is juggled and then incomplete Richards just couldn't hang on looked like a drop was it was it drop but it doesn't matter who I'm on rich was goes against he's creating separation because that time was against McFadden on the same route he had to catch earlier against the two freshmen this a lot of credit it's dessert Florida State they are Florida State backs off Russia's just free on third and long wazirs passes way off the marking complete intended for Cajun so a three now for the Hurricanes and I left upon those ears parents here in the crowd 60 second alltime meeting between Florida State and Miami three wide rights a wide left another wide right and then the block at the rock last year dirty had a blocked by Florida State earlier on a punt and this one takes a Miami hop here the 32 48 yard punt deal of punting this chapter the robberies for you a Tom Logan Dylan Tallahassee our Aflac trivia question Miami with 30 NFL draft firstround pick since 2000 most in the FBS all right who's number two since 2000 I'm gonna say Ohio State since 2000 that's the big one right Tom what you got quick I think Ohio State as well you guys looked Blackman in trouble here trying to get back to the line of scrimmage he's dragged down by RJ McIntosh for a sack that's his third sack of the year first time this year you guys get it right first time I think in the last two years you get it right my goodness five years for me yeah 27 for Ohio State Alabama third Florida State obviously the amount of talent that's on the field right now is truly off the charts these two teams for the last few decades have been so incredible Ameer Rasul is in the game and running back instead it's a pass out on the flat to Murray wrapped at the ankles and brought down after a pickup of six and we checked with that man don't sleep on Ohio State getting back into the conversation although obviously Oklahoma losing today doesn't help their cause right still have Penn State in Michigan and there he win the big ten with one loss I like their chances third and five Blackmun after all everybody covered Blackmon taken off and will not get the first down McIntosh there again and now Blackmon is hurt went down very awkward as he got grabbed from behind not all that dissimilar to the way DeAndre Francois went down and a couple plays earlier when he got sacked on first down went down and got up a little gingerly something to keep an eye on this Florida State offensive line having a tough time and pass protection but had been okay in the run game to this point for sure Logan Tyler getting his name called a lot on TV today this is a new ball didn't go very far but it takes in the perfec once inside the 30yard line it springs underneath the grass here at Doak Campbell one Alabama can the tide do it can put up 50 more points in an SCC game they've done in the last two weeks his Vanderbilt Knoll miss meanwhile James Blackman they're taping that right ankle he got dragged down on a sack he's been sacked three times by Miami so far today the backup is JJ Cosentino who played a couple years ago and the Peach Bowl because of an injury first in ten Rozier struggling but not on that pass on target first down true freshman Jim Thomas gain of 11 and they have to get the quick passing game going for Malik Rozier before that pass he was only 3 of 11 he has to get into a rhythm to soften up this defense because Florida State when they know what's coming they're very difficult to push around so that's only the seventh play they've gotten positive yardage on here in the first half Rozier will throw again and this one is knocked away by McFadden intended for Richards it's a great matchup keep an eye on throughout the game that is you referenced it earlier this is not the last time we will see this matchup Ramon Richards the sensational sophomore and of course McFadden one of the best defensive backs in the land few teams will test him with them on Richards out there if I'm Rozier I might give it a couple more looks but the coverage that tight it's gonna be tough to get a lot of completions think about it he at eight picks last year that's a ton for a guy that it doesn't get thrown out a lot they run Walton here just trying to get anything to make it third and manageable there's a penalty flag down they get about three yards if it holds up Miami's office just can't get out of its own way right now block in the back offense number 82 10yard penalty still second down Richards with a drop and now a penalty block in the back just a dumb penalty it's unnecessary that's those are the mistakes you can't make not against the defense that is a that is this much potential and quality throughout this defense is one of the best in the country and if you're constantly in a second and long situation you're going to have a very difficult time sustaining Drive are you Jimbo Fisher was thinking about declining that penalty he was trying to figure out okay what is 37 third and eighth and once he got that information from the officials he decided okay let's back them off your Miami right here in Florida states from Maryland might be time to go with a little bit of a screen pass or something to one of your wide receivers in space when Howell Mark Richt make adjustments black action lazier takes on those here gets knocked down hard at the 35 yard line by Matthew Thomas little forearm shiver to get him to the ground get back to the line of scrimmage third and long what a hit Matthew Thomas a good job right there I'm Malik Rozier second and long nothing's there you see some green grass in front go north and south to set up a little bit more manageable third down I'm him I'm looking for a Mon Richards testing that matchup against McDonald third down and nine Ray's here today playing burns last year as a freshman in almost 10 sacks he may have gotten back to the line of scrimmage there so it wouldn't officially be a sack for parents but still a great play to force a puck Bern's isn't the biggest guy on the field only around 227 pounds manis quick another fantastic punt fair catch made at the 16 yard line well fellows anytime you have a matchup of this magnitude that means you're gonna have Wars and recruiting as well and everybody in there brother wants to dip down in to South Florida take a look at these three counties Palm County Broward County and miamidade and look at the numbers but miamidade Florida State's got four prospects out of there so when you consider a Kelvin Benjamin that went to clay central Dalvin cook that went to Miami Central you get a handful of guys each and every year doesn't have to be 20 we get a couple out of Miami's territory you're gonna build quite a impressive roster that might be the most talented county in the country there ain't no doubt in everybody his his parked their car in that County first down to the 17 for Florida State off the left side goes to West Patrick another terrific scamper by Patrick for nine is we checking with that man why then you know luginbill does not mess around when it comes to recruiting this guy knows all when it comes to the best high school players in the best schools in counties as Patrick was shaken up on that last play got dragged down just shy of the line the game tackled by Joe Jackson and then you see that second defender Pat Bethel come on top of him who think it was hyperextended there at the bottom of the pile getting stretched out and you hope he's okay everyone in this stadium holding their breath right now Jacquizz patrick has been maybe the most consistent player on this offense over the last few weeks has really emerged weighted his time and now has become a goto guy in the running game and you hate to see him banged up right now hope he's okay got 84 rushing yards so far in the game kick off your week five NFL Sunday with ESPN at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time our Sunday NFL countdown crew will have all the early breaking stories injury updates preview of each game right up to kickoff it's all streaming live on the ESPN app we have a chance on Thursday night sit around as a group watch a former Seminole quarterback Jameis Winston and Tampa Bay fall to the New England Patriots as a Patrick get some help to the sidelines Greg day that's a that's an injury to keep track of because in Greg mentioned it earlier in the first quarter the young freshman cam akers is yet to square his pads and become that downhill figure that's exactly what jock has Patrick brings to this offense let's see what Akers can do stepping in now they have the same issue initially with Dalvin cook trying to get him to just keep it between the tackles and say to the young guy okay three or four yards that's okay you'll get your 70 yarder at some point they just need to hear to get a first down makers trying to get outside and he gets the first down another big hit in the secondary between D Delaney and the running back bakers and getting back to Akers it was funny talking to Jimbo Fisher yesterday he said the Henry doesn't score a touchdown on every single snap it's like he's disappointing you that's what he's done the last four years as a star in Mississippi so now when he's going against guys that are equal in Tallin it's okay to gain seven yards it's not a bad place he's learning but man is he going to be a good one here how many years to come seven yards out you'll be fifth in the country in here it's precariat s about five or six here there it is that's what you want right there yeah and finishing runs north and south and don't try to run to the outside the way you've always done but Tom you said it when you're a quarterback and you're doing zone reads schemes which is exactly what cam Akers did when he was a high school player your whole world is on the perimeter right you're outside the tackles all the time now that he's having to run between it takes some nuances and some learning to get on the level of some of the great backs we've seen in years past here in Tallahassee acres again and this time he's drilled by Michael Pinkney remember last year you had the three linebackers for Miami quarterman Pinkney in the cloud they're all true freshmen starting for Miami got to be impressed here with Jimbo Fisher guys duck as Patrick goes down and you line up and you hand it to the young true freshman the three consecutive plays now third and five so they're trying to keep Blackman in third and medium obviously they love third and short but he's old for six on third down did have a drop earlier by Gavin Blackmon and kept the making the catch near midfield 14 yards on the pickup a great job by James Blackman you see the pressure coming around the edge we decide to bring Pinkney and vacate the middle of the field with that zone pressure it's exactly the area of the field that they work a good job by the quarterback recognizing that green grass and finding his receiver in stride from the seminal 47 yard line Akers trying to find a hole he does and tripped up by Jaquan Johnson otherwise he may have had that big run he still got eight well this the best cam akers has looked this Drive right here does the best I've seen him early in his college career you see that decisive one cut running that we saw for so many years from Dalvin cook some people think the cam akers his future could resemble that of the former null star cook now the Vikings obviously dealing with injury there in Minnesota this year unfortunately jakers inside the miami 40 both Patrick and acres and that offensive line you mentioned earlier great bangup on the left side but right now they are holding the line of scrimmage just leaning on that Miami front there they are that running game is really starting to get going and that's exactly what Jimbo Fisher is always done yeah he's had great quarterbacks three first rounders but it's about the run game that's the starting point they have all their timeouts are inside the Miami 40yard line but here's a good play by Chad Thomas wrapping up Akers for a loss they came in averaging nine tackles for a loss per game they've already had a handful including three sacks secondyear d coordinator Manny Diaz former student at Florida State doc has Patrick back in the game now at tailback guys has to come in for second at 14 black mana thrall and underneath to Patrick maybe got back to the line of scrimmage so third long coming up that tried to get with a little Vegas screen but no pressure coming from Miami the linebackers were easily able to rally to the throw you got to be smart with the clock here to make Jimbo Fisher obviously thinking about letting that clock run all the way down so if in fact they do have to give it back to Miami it will be with minimal time and on one timeout run play here just try to get a chunk I would throw it I would throw it now to throw it downfield that's what James back Blackmun does best early in his career he's going to throw it on third down at 15 and open the middle it's picked off he cleared and Michael Jackson when a diving interception caught it with his club and they're trying to get the turnover Chami look he's jumping up and down saying where's my chain they give a necklace each time you get a turnover and Michael Jackson's got it right now just make sure he caught it this ACC crew will look at it from every angle doesn't catch it initially but does he secure it before he hits the ground appears like he does catastrophic mistake right there from James Blackman well it may not read on the field the previous play is under review it may not be Greg because Miami hasn't been able to get the length of their pinky finger on offense so if you consider the field position battle having been won by Florida State that wasn't ideal but the way this defense is playing it may not kill him of course take another look at and remember has to be indisputable video evidence to overturn now he doesn't catch it initially but does Jackson's left hand get under the ball and secure it before it hits the ground I think the glove was wellplaced onto the ball you keep referencing the glove Michael Jackson the glove we get it well I wasn't sure if you would catch that I know Luke and Bo got old like me I love it now it can touch the ground as long as you possess it in control and again it's got to be beyond all doubt to overturn the ruling on the field replay theme complete the action of the captive ball can touch the ground it Ken as long as it's secured gameday Operations Center in Greensboro gets involved as well that'll be the first interception to the season for Blackmon if it's staying he given the fact this guy's a true freshman trying to learn this offense which Jameis Winston mastered the fact that's just his first interception after in his season ruling a field stand first down and look Jackson he's happy he got the pick he's even more happy he gets to keep the necklace in the chain that's their 6th take away this year and Miami with possession but they have moved the ball at all they only have one timeout left early timeouts if they had to purr on fourth downs of all coming back to vital boys here uploads downfield and it is incomplete Barrios couldn't hang on here's that man right Rozier throws it's nearly intercepted by Erwin James stepping in front of the receiver James one of the best safeties in the country missed most of last year with a knee injury last time Miami scoreless in the first half that was two years ago against North Carolina on the road they got blown out that was a before mark Rick's arrival now third and ten Florida State's think we might get the ball back here so let's see what Mark Richt calls here does he play it safe and just hand it off Rozier has really struggled 4:15 passing did you let him sleep in here here Margaret run coming out there him gets rid of it almost intercepted again McFadden there's a penalty marker down he got tangled up with him on Richards flag was drawn in the backfield Brian burns got pressures no foul 15yard penalty first down Oh Miami had one of those earlier now it's Florida State's turn for the dumb penalty to keep the drive alive late in the quarter it was closed house bangbang it's not often that you see call made like that that certainly wasn't egregious I think that's a bad call I think so too Tom that's the act of the tackle and that's coming from two quarterbacks yeah for the first time this year three guys agree cuz up with you guys and first down Rozier sing a note that Josh sweat just a second sack of the year after seven last year one of the top recruits in the country a couple years ago and a timeout called here by Miami that is the final timeout by the hurricane well if you're florida state I mean you're Owen for the first time in three decades you go to play at Wake Forest team that's really good defensively a sneak out of there with a win you got a true freshman quarterback and you're playing lightsout defensively right now yeah hanging but you knew that your defense was gonna be exceptional coming into the year all the personnel back all the stars all the players that have a lot of long future ahead of them on Sundays now they're having to lean on them because of the injury to francois but you start to see the running game getting going which has got to be a sign that this team starting to understand who they are their defense they can lean on them that run game could become pretty special if this offensive line continues to improve but Miami hasn't had much of a pulse offensively all day first sack of the game for FSU Rozier run get some yardage back that's interesting they called a timeout now let's see if they hustle third and long or if they just say you know what we're just gonna let the clock run down here it's well guys in the field at one point third and 13 Rozier going downfield I had a man but he overthrew it in Laurens pager there was a defender who was hurling down on cager but he was open he had him for a minute but man that's a tough throw a very tough throw and that's a small window considering the balls traveling 40 yards downfield Rozier tried to make it publicly pressing a little bit lucky didn't throw his wide receiver into a massive blow up in the backend Rozier two of his last 13 he saw that they haven't run a play in Miami territory so the fair catch made by McFadden with three seconds left let's see a Florida State let's Blackmon who has decent arm to throw it deep or if they just take a knee go to halftime with a three nothing lead I think you kneel on it especially given the hey Miami's been able to get after the passer today already three sacks registered by the Canes defense and Neal on it go into halftime feeling good about what your team's done to this point plus if you get it picked off deep remember Miami's got that lateral thing mastered if you want that happen again three nothing Florida State at halftime go back to the studio it's streaming live on the ESPN app download now and take ESPN everywhere welcome back to Tallahassee and ESPN's afternoon college football presented by PlayStation View you're watching the ACC on ESPN Florida State leads Miami as we get ready for 40 number three three to nothing that others trying to get back to 500 Miami trying to stay unbeaten the opposite of gaudy numbers in the first half for both teams 54 yards of offense for Miami now they had the ball half the amount of time the Florida State and the Seminoles could only muster 163 and a field goal we'll see what kind of adjustments both offensive minded head coaches make you if they can make them with their personnel tyler's kick results in a touchback and Miami will start on the 25 1959 that's the lowest scoring game in the series you weren't around because I know I wasn't around our parents may not have been around out there that was seven six by the way in case you're wondering Miami wanted bad offense really good defense combination of both combination to both you have to give credit to what these offenses are doing at the line of scrimmage they are not getting pushed around whatsoever especially when you look and what Florida State is doing defensively who'll get the start here in the second half these two defensive tackles both naughty and Christmas have been a handful for the Canes to this point 530 pump yards combined between these two teams row zero foot pump fake taking a shot down the field and almost tip intercepted by McFadden did a great job but they call a flag well it looked like he had good coverage that time and almost picked off the ball pass interference defense number 415 kind of first half look at McFadden right here never looks back at the football that's gonna get called every single time now is tight coverage if he just turns over his right shoulder and looks back at the football it's not only not a pass interference it could be an interception Westbrook still almost got it on the redirection but because of the foul first down at the 40 yard line for Miami they come out throw it here it's deflected it almost picked off by Matthew Thomas and Matthew Thomas talk about reading eyes really quick rose ears eyes to the left Thomas drops right underneath the stop route on the lefthand side almost picks it off just too much juice on the ball from Rozier you got it wonder about the health of Walton coming out throwing on first down and was here as four of 17 you got throw it again here Barrios out in space and it's a good pickup banged out a play at the 48 yard line Kerwin James on the hit keen of a buddy and I think they're throwing it because they recognize that they have a significant disadvantage in the trenches right now based on the way the first half played out running the ball is not the answer because of these defensive tackles and this defensive front seven for Florida State especially if you're number one tailbacks not hundred percent that was a terrific throw fire Rozier that's his guy Braxton Barrios they were onetime roommates they have a connection Barrios has as many catches now this season that he had all of last year while Brad Kyle was a quarterback has been very reliable it has uncovered on multiple occasions for Rozier quick slot receiver that's very versatile from the Florida State 47 rozier quarterback keeper and he gets leveled as he went for the slide no flag though as Myers came in with a hit they come out throw him to try to open up the run game and the quarterback picks up about five Miami getting back to some of those RPO concepts with bubbles by the slot receivers and so and read between the running back on the quarterback have had success early first time Miami's been in Florida State Territory a pass break up at the 25yard line by Westbrook earned in the tight end was the intended receiver this offense has got to become more diverse in some of their route patterns and their concepts I mean they've become predictable right now Greg you've had slants by the inside guys off the zone read action slants by the outside targets and Allen Richard off of the zone read action in really nothing else so these Florida State defenders are in position to make the play and let that all these defenders are there confident group and they're going to challenge every bro no down linemen all standing up coming after Rozier here a third down and five going deep for Barrios Barrios it just makes it turn up the ground down that burials pushup yes he did that'll be on him and the gates of 35yard reception and a huge call wicked Barrios oh that's very obvious with his left hand you see him right to the back of kyle myers jersey &amp; myers goes flying forward good call by the official it doesn't always get called especially when you don't see extension turf by the wide receiver it's great i buy this acc officiating crew your third and 20 on this drive do they do it here and just play conservatively and go to field position Rozier sling it and he's looking downfield receiver get open Richards on 3rd and 20 down the sidelines and they moved the sticks 33 yards how did the receiver get open how did Miami's best receiver get open is the better question McFadden adjust in it cover to his responsibilities is the flat the safeties late getting over the top too big time throw from Rozier Rozier will keep it here off the left side he's got Running Room it's a huge it was Richard a whisper that gets the King feelings fair enough Westbrook ease her what a hit is that legal it is but that is a lot of contact let's see he lowers his head it's all in the shoulder he was in front of him he's in front of him it's legal it's within the rules it's just a bangbang collision and credit Miami and this wide receiver group over the last couple years they've been one of the best blocking wide receiver groups I've seen in college football back in a moment one of the alltime great rivalries in college football we've had just about everything so far except touchdowns big hits big punts even had defensive lineman for Miami Kendrick Norton playing the guitar with James Blackmun's leg after he sacked him quit in Miami on this Drive more yards here than they had the tire first half after the lung by Rozier at second down into Waltons first touch of the third quarter and he spun forward by Josh sweat close to the first down at the 15 yard line Walton we reference it in the first half he's been nursing an ankle injury the left ankle just doesn't have the same level of explosiveness that we've seen from him over the years just a little hesitant when he hits the hole something to watch here in the next 30 minutes of this ball game only his seventh carry of the game for 13 yards on first down it's Rozier keeping it sweat on the takedowns it's just a couple of yards for Rozier and this is just the fifth career start we talked a lot about Blackman for Florida State his inexperience at quarterback this is rose ears first time in the rivalry and started one game two years ago and Brad Kyle was hurt on all three games he's played so far this year is a starting point event but obviously this is her biggest check so far and the first time in a truly hostile environment Tallahassee one of the toughest places to play Rozier has a couple rushing touchdowns on the year on second and nine balls it back but as endzone and he had very else he just threw it wide of though it's third down and nine about a 30yard field goal attempt from here if they are unable to convert he had Barrios in the back of the endzone but man there was some push up front it made it difficult for Rozier to pull through on his throw which caused it to drift now here in third and nine think Rozier has to drop back and try to find home on Richards 82 they connected for a big third down conversion earlier in the offensive the bottom of your screen matched up on McFadden for the state showing blitz here they come on third and was here it was deflected aligned appeared and then almost intercepted by McFadden no it's for doubt you tried to find Richards and a great job I'm McFadden closing that gap that was wellcovered not a lot of places to go with it ball came out a little funny I don't know if it for sure was Ted yet did it was that was his arm on lane guys a former white receiver number seven the safety in the gap there 31year a try Badgley to tide again and we're even at three apiece you a backstage pass all weekend long into what goes into staging a college football game here's Florida State's masa mascot chief Osceola along with the renegade getting prepped and ready now about that the horse gets a police escort you guys had to walk from the hotel a guy had a lift but the horse is more important than than some of the players I feel like Hulk here joking aside man how great is that there's the payoff right hey Dave the horse is a sedentary animal Greg and I are thoroughbreds I mean I'll tell you what I've been looking forward to this game all week and have been looking forward to that moment maybe as much as any and in our broadcasting career seeing that at midfield was really special and taking it all in what a great tradition Florida State has by me ties the game with a short field goal and now the kickoff was through the end zone for a touchback James Blackmon threw an interception towards the end of the first half after getting injured he was taken down twice by RJ McIntosh in on this last one you see him go for the right ankle he got that heavily taped shortly thereafter and if you look at his feet now in the second half he has tape on both ankles it'll be something to watch here and the place to come can he drive off that right foot Chuck was Patrick out there as well remember he got dinged a little bit in the first half play action black men being chase good job by the Titan not the whole Blackmun's past dangerous throw its picked off deed the lady on the interception in Miami takes over in Florida State Territory and they're getting the chain ready the turnover chain is coming on again second takeaway for the Canes Blackmon getting out and making a very bad decision throwing in the double coverage to the corner route he had a wide receiver about six yards from the line of scrimmage standing right on the boundary which would have been a massive massive play if he would have just taken it right there there was no one around the lady dropped way out underneath me give it to one of these Florida State wide who knows what they're going to do with it what a bad decision from the true freshmen no interceptions and his three previous starts who I should say previous starts but to so far today as Miami runs Marc Walt here's straight ahead and it's a gain of four Jacob Pugh on the tackle just feel the life kind of go out of this stadium a little bit after the first drive by Miami and then converting for a field goal and now after the interception not quite as noisy as it is for this Miami offense to operate and communicate that's play rozier in trouble and he's able to get away from Noddy and get out of bounds go down as a sack loss of three in the place of third lon formerly Crozier turn over to buddy's got turned over changed a beer cans seven times they've given up the chain this year seven takeaways by the defense rozier on third and long listen and again am on Richard somehow gets old and I'm third down and long massive mistake defensively by Florida State giving up 18 yards mana Richards didn't have much going in the first half but you think they've made him a point of emphasis here after halftime three receptions already a target in the red zone and then they're opening it up on the dig route outstanding stuff feeding that zone coverage from Florida State AJ Westbrook who was injured earlier after getting drilled by Manu Richard's been walked under his own power the sidelines he's shaken up again first down for the Hurricanes inside the Florida State 30yard line you're starting to see Malik Rozier really get into the game he has been streaky to say the least look he hasn't played a lot of football but he's a veteran guy he's hung in there but when he catches fire he's as good as anybody in the ACC and right now he's dealing a hot hand they just said the previous play is under review they're just gonna look to see if indeed it was a reception well you mentioned the inexperience of Rozier at one time Mark Richt the head coach said you won't play for me because he would free lunch too much try to do his own thing Rosie and Rick told him that Rozier took it to heart and has become more of an efficient player now actually we're being told that it's not an issue of the catch it's where did he go down because clearly he's got the ball his got was possession of it the question is did he go down there at the 33 or did he make it to the 29 it didn't appear that his knee was down and they marked it at the 29 so that's the ruling of the field and these are the replays that I just don't like I understand it's a difference of a couple yards that's big you're egging pregaming he's Mia is down there look into that repo it is but any momentum created by the conversion has now been squashed because they want to take a look at a difference of a couple of yards it's just not a big enough deal to me to warrant looking at it and making up this much of a difference now all the momentum for the offense is squash like I said yeah but it's the right call Miami shouldn't be given the 29 yard line Seaver caught the ball his knee was down with the ball at the 32 yard line it is still a first down first and 10 at the 32 when those three yards could make all the difference between winning and losing I'm actually in this rival you're right it's a game of inches there's no denying that it just when you're an offensive player and you're getting into a rhythm and you're starting to feel a flow both in the passing game and with what you're off at the coordinator is calling when you have hesitations in the action it's tough to recover from from time to time and especially on quarterback Salix take a look here we'll see how he handles his situation after getting into a rhythm welcome trying to pick the hole reverses field and is swarmed by Florida State defenders Lane leading the charge so it's a loss of a yard of the play is so impressed with this Florida State defense not only are they gifted physically but they play so well within the scheme they contain runners they don't get out of their gap along the front and then they rally to the football when a ball carriers about to be stopped really fun to watch this group and they're going to continue to improve they've won seven in a row against Miami last wing for the Canes was here in 2009 and here's a deep ball into the end zone over draw and intercept two freshmen Stanford Samuels in the end zone for a touchback just win Miami had seized all the momentum Florida State's defense comes up big again this time the freshman Samuel secure in the pit breck talked about momentum being stalled because of the review and then on the next play it's an interception by Rozier so Florida State takes over on the 20yard line and they run the ball and falling forward as true freshman cam Akers for two yards to the 22 and it's important to know that the ACC officiating crew the replay officials the people back in Greensboro headquarters they did the right thing but it kills the offenses momentum and stuff to retain here's a pitch to Akers trying to get outside a flag down vapors picks up about three Lake Young on the takedown but again a penalty flag that is against Florida State holding up number 54 that's the center Alec Everly keep an eye on Everly right over the middle see if he grabs the defender clearly does you see that left hand grabbing the shoulder with big number seven Kendrick Norton he would like Norton Plan and Quebec swag as a guitar in the first quarter though I don't think I've ever seen that before that's a unique celebration I mean that I'm gonna hang on to that one he tackled Blackman held his leg and then act like he was playing the guitar that's gift worthy that was hip it and he just forced the holding penalty on Florida State second and 18 acres fines running Road past the 20 yard line he gets 12 yards their big run on second down when they needed a chunk play huge run right there has some contact in the backfield he put his foot in the ground and went right up the gut for a nice gain to set up third and manageable we haven't seen tape get involved much in the passing game at some point they gotta get their big star wide receiver odd and tape involved who sees on the most battling a shoulder injury here's a screen Ian Patrick can't come up with it oh he gets drilled after the whistle they throw the flag the Miami linebacker knew exactly what had taken place he thought it was a fumble and that's why he came and drilled Chuck was Patrick doesn't matter if he knew or not still should be if there is no Palamon apart I think that should be a penalty I understand look intense all that stuff he didn't mean to hit Patrick late he doesn't unload on him here uh II think he tries to hold up with the last he doesn't go for the head or anything it's not a defenseless player it's still two steps away that should be a call it should be a call and I'm an offensive guy I understand that as a former quarterback but right there Pinkney was late I know he didn't intend to do anything wrong but what he did was in fact wrong and I think it should have been rewarded with a fresh set of downs for Florida State given the contact that was hat I'm not so sure he didn't think he fumbled it that's why I hit him so hard line drive barielle spun the 35yard line penalty marker down as there isn't just about every tip barrios inside the 40yard line at the 20 the official picked up the flag there wasn't a penalty he he meant to throw her bag but he meant to throw the beanbag yeah bitch it's a little different meaning the beanbag is when the football changes possessions or when it's a fumble he threw the flag instead but I think Florida states saw that and when you see the flag thrown and look at the official you assume it's it's coming back you can see the flag fly in there but he ran right to it embarrassingly enough grab the flag put it in his pocket and then threw the bean bag hoping nobody would see it but you gotta think Florida State did that had to have impact to the play you see the bean bag located right next to that flag on his right hip that time fled the bean bags on his left hip now I think he might have had it on the wrong side big return though from Barrios nonetheless first out of 21 yard line at Florida State bass play brassiere looking engine watch them burials with a touchdown catch in every game though so far this season for Miami Claire since Andre Johnson their stories are a little different Andre Johnson highly recruited multiple Paul Bowles in the NFL Braxton burrows had 12 catches all of last year he had the great punt return to set up his own touchdown catch the point after makes it ten three canes we talked about Rozier Dylan a hot hand how about Braxton Barrios the punt return and then getting rewarded with the seam route in the back shoulder catch rows ears loving it so are the caves bears fans a lot of it anyway have been calling from Mitchell true Biscay for a while they get their wish on Monday Night Football he makes his debut as the Bears starting quarterback as they keep take on Minnesota don't know who the Vikings quarterback will be because it Bradford's ailments it all started some Monday night countdown 6:00 Eastern they patch Greg McElroy Tom Luke and Bill Deere in Tallahassee the first touchdown of the game comes at the 657 mark in Miami in front and after trailing three nothing at halftime and now Gavin stutterstep takes it out and should not have the against level at the 10 yard line let's go back to the touchdown this is all made possible because Derwin James is favoring the right hash I don't know why either because the two best receivers this is Barrios and this is Amon Richards on a fade under Ralph Houk and Erwin James be on the right hand side when the two biggest threats in the passing game are on the lefthand side he's got to be smarter and understanding where the personnel is because he just hung out AJ Westbrook with one on one coverage against a very capable slot receiver dirt when James is a star as good a college football player as we have in this country but right there tried to get a little tricky with his eyes trying to fool Rozier and Rosie are know exactly where to go with it great execution and he got Westbrook who's been shaken up twice and speaking of injuries the return man keep Gavin is down he got suplexed by Travis Homer got his new take take a look at this third quarter two distinct differences number one we have spent all our time if you're watching from home on the far right of your football screen every single series whether it's been offense or defense for either team so Miami has a huge advantage in field position secondly and Greg we talked about this to open the corner Miami had to become more diverse in their passing game create some more opportunities downfield aside from the slant route they've gone to that and it has been very very fruitful downfield they've got Florida State on their toes right now a little bit defensively and Gavin is shaking up odd and Tate has been battling that shoulder injury so you get a couple of guys now at receiver for Florida State that part under present if Gavin can even come back but has that really mattered lately I mean Florida State still finds a way to beat Miami despite the Hurricanes leading in the last three matchups this is all about Florida State's ability to get back to doing what they did in the first half running the football controlling the line of scrimmage and not making mistakes the quarterback spot and it's about whether or not Miami's ready for the moment everyone appears that everyone thinks that this team's ready to take a big step forward we're gonna find out in the next 21 minutes of game time whether or not they are Patrick trying to cut it back taken down for a loss it was Shaq quarterman in Miami among the nation's leaders and tackles for loss they get another one there so obviously Florida State's struggling offensively it makes it a lot worse now because you're behind the sticks yeah and really I'm surprised too Florida State had success in the first half using their fullback and using multiple tight we haven't seen that yet to this point in the second half and here they are again then 11 personnel with three wide receivers on the field that past chuckled and then pulled in by is oh that a nice job to secure it at the 21 so that'll put him in third and manageable haven't seen many third and short situations for the true freshmen James Blackmun and I think getting him on the perimeter with a run pass option might be the best thing for him in this particular spot getting him on the edge and allowing him to see out in front of him and allowing to make be a little bit more comfortable if they do decide to throw it here roll anywhere now in trouble being chased Blackman throws it up for tape and throws it away but there's a penalty marker down in the backfield and actually there's one at the line of scrimmage as well so two markers down it was exactly what they tried to do try to get Blackman outside the pocket to make it easier in the throwing lanes see what they have here are two fouls on the play by each team and elsewhere receiver downfield offense number 69 personal foul roughing the passer defendant number 30 13 those fouls off second all right Craig so he get another chance here for Blackmon you've played in rivalry games obviously in Alabama what's going through his mind he's a true freshman playing in the biggest game of his career his team's down but you're in a position where he can make a play third and two and he's made some mistakes too in the last couple quarters late in the first half throwing the interception through an early interception in this half on a poor decision they tried to spring him out there give him something easy now they might opt to run the football the amount of people that are in the box for Miami he's got Patrick with him in the backfield they fake the jet sweep black man breaks attack the thighs and has the first down the kid made a play there wait a sec yeah he did what a play nothing there defensively they tried once again to get him outside the pocket just makes you so much more comfortable as a passer seeing the throwing lanes when you're outside the tackle box and good thing James Blackman is six foot five and change because if he was any shorter I'm not sure he would have gotten it Manny Diaz disgusted after that one let's see how that impacts the confidence of Blackman maybe gets him going hey Ron Akers beautiful cut back by Akers right behind a teammate cutting it back to the middle and picking up 13 yards in a first down here's the Florida State offense that we saw in the first half under center Bend plays with the running back getting back to the back side and they had a lot of success with both Patrick and Akers they need to continue to establish that ground attack to take some of the pressure off James Blackmon the true freshman starting quarterback Greg with a running back cam a per acre is right there it looks like he was going to bounce it outside but then he plants his foot in the ground and gets upfield and he's gonna start to sense oh wait a minute big plays can happen between the tackles and most importantly they've gotten out of a huge hole that they have spent the entire third quarter in on both sides of the football Sheldrick red wine shaken up on the play makers with 58 yards rushing on 12 attempts Patrick has 83 yards rushing in nine attempts he at eight for 84 early in the second quarter so he's only touched it once since but he's also had some injury issues in Florida State trying to avoid a oneinthree start loss to Alabama lost their quarterback in that game DeAndre Francois the Rookie of the Year in the ACC Blackmon comes in as a true freshman never thought he'd play at all this year and then he starts the next three games including here today against the rivals Akers a late second penalty flag comes in there was a Florida State player without his helmet that's where the first marker came down and then a second one came soaring in from down field they're gonna get Ryan is I want to hold here offense number 81 10yard penalty first down I can't believe the officials saw this one this is not just a hold WWE that is that is throw them out of the club my goodness I mean I've seen a whole thing fuller and I've seen guys try to save a life and try to hang on for dear life that was just unnecessary I don't watch so Greg if you're gonna do it do it right I think those two guys right there probably have some experience throwing guys around they could throw me out of the ring I'm not getting in the ring with those guys no first down on the 27 at Florida State Blackman tried to dump it off and his boat was picked off it was deflected by McIntosh at the line of scrimmage here is at nan in the studio that was a really good story on game day about Kenny Hill and the chance at redemption how much he's matured and learned since the Kenny the trill days back at Texas A&amp;M be a great redemption story of TC you can somehow make it to the college football playoff jock was Patrick to the 32 picks up five yards on second and 20 so you're gonna third down and long here yeah this is such a tough spot to be in and if you look Miami just subbed out about looked like fifteen guys of course it was only about seven or eight but whole new set of bodies and the depth of this defense is so improved from where it was a year ago Manny Diaz the defensive coordinator has no problem taking out his starters and putting in the replacements or in this case taking out the replacements putting the starters back into third down third and 16 the lot Blackmon throw he's in trouble gets head and it's incomplete Joe Jackson hit pressure and pushing and shoving after the play derek kelly shoves Joe Jackson but for now the officials keeping hold of their flags how greater rivalry games it's just every snap you don't know what you're gonna get Joe Jackson right they're taking the left tackle Derek Kelly for a and bringing Blackmun down just as he was releasing the pass his florida state front has done a pretty good job offensively in the run game but they've struggled in the passing game throughout the course of the game Logan Tyler is really punted the ball beautifully today gets off another good one Barrios force to make the fair catch 52 yard punt well think of all the great NFL players that have played in this rivalry Braxton Barris is probably a name that a lot of people will remember but not because he ended up playing the NFL it's because he not only had this punt return but he sets up his own touch to help with himself out here on his back shoulder throw by Rozier makes a terrific grab but a goahead score what a job he's done the senior hasn't been a focal point of the offense underutilized well Brad kya was here of course the joke ku and Richards and and Kohli they were the primetime guys so he kind of waited in the wings but now as a senior he's taking full advantage of his opportunity he's a team'll Trophy finalist that goes to the academic Heisman winner so to speak pass downfield in traffic broken up by Derwin James who was intended for of on Richards he's been tearing up the Florida State secondary here in the second half but not that time and Derwent James Rozier and Richards fortunate there that that wasn't intercepted James made a nice play on the football and Richards did a good job of trying to be strong with it those are two outstanding players that will be playing football for a long time Jimbo Fisher says yesterday Joe and James can play all 11 positions typically probably exaggerating you definitely play corner that was a great break on the ball Rozier will keep on second and 10 gets a block thank goes to the first down he's got it at the 28 yard line I love when the NFL scout s defensive coordinator Charles Kelly well what do you mean he can play all 11 he can play the nose tackle he said well they wouldn't walk him he said yeah I'd line him right up over the center at defensive tackle and I guarantee you he'd get home that's rough it Derwin James number three he's a guy to keep an eye on a fresh set of downs for Miami on the 28 yard line here's a pass to Richard's out in space an excellent block downfield by the true freshman Mike Harley springing Richards for a good pickup there I'm telling you you watch this Miami offense and the wide receivers in particular watch how hard they work on the perimeter blocking it's truly outstanding bury us with the cut and Harley on the outside lasting forever Florida State's wide receivers who struggle blocking at times they could learn a thing or two from watching these guys on the edge really push guys around no doubt Harley's got a mobile second and three third side on the 35 yard line well he does around just cut upfield but he didn't he went around Barrios pushed out of bounds by Thomas into the Florida State bench but Walt escapes it'll be third down tell you what he's just not the same guy today ten carries only fifteen yards and he's not a hundred percent every time he's gotten the football Florida State has been able to find him of course he has that left and bothersome still been productive at this point but certainly hasn't been a feature player for the Canes today rozier strength tapped by Barrios able to stretch forward and get the first down to the 40yard line the senior from Raleigh North Carolina five nine hundred and eighty pounds having a career day he just knows how to get open I mean he's not the fastest he's certainly not the biggest at five nine but he knows how to use his body and to create separation it's very savvy within the routes that Mark Richt puts on him and man does Rozier trusts him in the passing game Rozier to the air again takes off with everybody covered and slides know to go down as a sack a loss of a couple yet Jacob Pugh and Derrick naughty getting some pressure that time inside a minutes ago here in the third quarter smart play there and Craig by Malik Rozier when you could consider this court third quarters winding down you're up points are at a premium possessions are even more important right now don't fake stupid plays under center now we saw Rozier take a shot earlier in the quarter and get picked off trying to go for second at 12 there's a blitz off the edge and the receiver cage were able to make the catch that was McFadden who's initially coming him he came out of blitz and cage was picked up by AJ Westbrook who's hurt again that's the third time Westbrook has shaken up he's gonna have to come out the order goes back to that first hit by him on Richards on the Block if he's ever been a hundred percent since that hit yeah he's gonna be sore tomorrow there's no doubt he's playing hard though I tell you why didn't and he's a little overshadowed in this secondary of course McFadden Samuels and James and and Taylor they're allstars but Westbrook he's done a heck of a job to this point of the season college football rankings brought to you by Playstation big news of the day Oklahoma goes down at home with Iowa State playing a backup quarterback and the Sooners out of 24 to seven lead when if they started thinking about the Longhorns who they have next week some point of that ballgame Penn State rolls again Georgia rolls again in Washington place tonight on ESPN against Cal Michigan Michigan State tonight on ABC three quarters down one to go here in the sixty second meeting between Florida State and Miami the difference in the ballgame Baxton Barrios with the lone touchdown ten three canes after three welcome back to ESPN's afternoon college football presented by PlayStation you watching the ACCC on ESPN start of the fourth quarter this game originally scheduled for September 16th postponed because of Hurricane Irma we thought we might have hurricane condition two days ago here but it's been sunny skies most of the day and there is some contact downfield on third and six between Mullins and Levante Taylor a Florida State but no penalty marker and so the Canes have to punt big start from the Seminole defense it's a little bit of contact it could have potentially been a pass interference but a good no call by the official true freshman zachf eagle whose dad Jeff played 22 years in the NFL short punt and Florida State will take that only a 33yard feet in just over an hour on ABC its Michigan Michigan State from Ann Arbor you all remember what happened there the last time these two teams played Michigan about to close out the game a botched snap on the punt Michigan State returns it for a touchdown and the Spartans escape with a win Jalen Watts Jackson I will never forget that name for I live what an ending Florida State takes over on the 23 and they run the ball nice haul a pouncing territory here in the fourth quarter this has been Florida State's bread and butter all day under center downhill rushing attack and cam akers in the open field started to deliver on all that promise that he had coming out of high school as one of the top ranked players in the country what a great play by the Knowles offense 46 yards and what if Jimbo tell us yesterday just keep trying between the tackles even though he didn't get anything there you're gonna finally break one and he did it'll be second long though after porterman made the tackle at the 31 yard line Jimbo Fisher has never lost backtoback home games and sacking over the plate NC State a September 23rd lost that game their lone win came on the road last week at Wake Forest this year you see the demonstrative conversation with his quarterback James black men who made incredible strides since training camp going into the year thinking he was going to be the back up until France was injury Blackmun throws here gets popped up first down inside the 20 a George Campbell you know what we're watching James Blackman they're still doing everything at the line of scrimmage and as you just referenced when head coach Jimbo Fisher coaches and he coaches him hard he doesn't coach him like he's a freshman he doesn't coddle him and this young man maintains the same level of composure the same body language in the same facial expression whether he's getting complimented or whether he's getting ripped Bachmann has him at the 15yard line back to Akers and in the backfield down he goes a loss of one on the play for diamond drills him first and then taken down after by two more canes Tom this is where Florida State has struggled in the red zone they've been very good when it comes to converting field goals no denying that but in their last 13 red zone penetrations only three touchdowns they got to get seven here obviously against a great defense black man hit as he throws nearly intercepted as Jaquan Johnson stepped in front Auden Tate I'm trying to remember the last time he was targeted if at all in this game they tried to get it to him there now Auden Tate has taken a backseat to some of the other great players on this Florida State team Jimbo not happy on the sidelines as his team gets ready to take on a third and 10 the red zone woes continue if you look at 1st and 2nd down he predetermined that throw rug they did dad time is dead ocean pressure and the face of the quarterback great clock winding down its hit and black and I don't think saw it so Jimbo Fisher calls a timeout let's watch Jimbo here with his young quarterback look at him seen him talking him up anis telling ma it's quarters he can't throw post against quarters Poetics me to safety his hanging on the right side and he occupies the space the tate was running right into fortunate that that second down throat wasn't intercepted but I love this I absolutely love this Jimbo Fisher he's hard on this quarterbacks there's no denying that but how many quarterbacks have left Tallahassee and you felt as though their best was not brought out from Jimbo Fisher he challenges the guys and then he stalks him to the next play I just love the way he handles the development of that position he hasn't high in recruiting to make sure he brings in guys that aren't thinskinned that won't go in the tank and then he also finds guys with incredible talent like James Blackman and some of the great ones before they'll put him an empty here on third down in ten and the kid make a play from the 15 of Miami to the hurricane Blackmon gets it donnnnneee in order to change the top first touchdown of the season for his own Ricki Aguayo on a tie up to 10 new game the 1217 to go Jimbo said this kid has it the ability to bounce back after a bad decision comes right back throws a strike we got a call game in Tallahassee college football is presented by PlayStation View watch up biggest moments in sports try it free today they've come alive here at Doak Campbell and not just in the stands on the sidelines and the quarterback James Blackmon after Jimbo Fisher has a lengthy conversation with him trying to encourage him also pointing out flaws from the previous couple plays grows a dark we have a tie game with 1217 to go here's deejay Dallas takane's and he's up to the 20 and a penalty marker comes flying in if that's on Miami that'll put him back inside the 15yard line the last time Miami beat Florida State was 2009 here in Tallahassee by the way that was an overtime the only time these two teams have played to overtime of course over time wasn't around for a lot of those years when these two teams met are we headed there again Miami's won eight straight over all coming in the last loss against Notre Dame October of last year that's now the third longest active streak because of Oklahoma which had the longest at 14 in a row that mean to an end today with the Sooners need to go home to Iowa State in the backup quarterback right now the backup quarterback for Florida State just tied the game consistent as the teens are backed up at their night they're just going to hand it off here to Travis Homer runs out of real estate near the 15 as we check in with that now that's interesting you mentioned that because in a couple days ago we're flying in here to Tallahassee there was talk they might move this game again maybe move the start time up or movie today earlier they stuck with the 3:30 kick and blue skies they've got a ways to go and it's supposed to rain later too hurricane Nate expected to make landfall along the Gulf Coast Rozier and mana Richards headed up field that pass before the sidelines and so it's third down in five Richard shaking his head like what are you doing really good job there by Tavares McFadden number four the corner down here Greg they were going to do a corner at corner Lee Crozier the miami quarterback he checks out of it but then Charles Kelley the defensive coordinator standing right next to me here he checks out of the corner blitz confuses the quarterback win on defense for Florida State that's algebra that's advanced algebra right there being able to check and adjust defensively when Rozier to throw on third down Richards oh we almost caught it McFadden coverage throw is there by Rozier but it on Richards could not hang on its fourth down good coverage by McFadden you see the contact I know Miami fans are probably looking at that screaming saying that's too much the balls in the air more often than not in the bangbang play like that you're never going to get the call there's a wellthrown ball in decent route just great coverage by the allamerica defendant Viggo's last kick was not good this one is much better McFadden has to back upfield to notice 38 gets out of a tackle McFadden breaks another run they left it away though on this time tackled at the 35 it's mark Walton on special teams making a great play some of the crazy end of game situations like wide right one back in 1991 and then a year later Dan Maori missing from 39 yards to tie the game wide right but a couple other than right white rights a wide left thrown in there and then last year they blocked the game tying extra point played in the fourth quarter and you think about it all the great talent that's come out of these two schools the kicking game has defined this series and I'm not going to try to diagnose what goes on in the mind of a kicker but you want there those two guys we just saw are they thinking about the history of this rivaling in Miami territory for a first down by Murray let's go to the studio on that man and a tie game here at 10 apiece under 11 minutes to go Florida State in Miami Territory as you see the confidence of James Blackmon growing every snap they run it here BAM acres to the 43 4 4 yard Greg on that last play night Quan Murray actually fell down he falls down and gets up and is still able to make the play what a wonderful foam football to the sideline and that was the exact same route concept that got intercepted earlier when Blackman tried to force the corner out in a double coverage this time with a little bit more oneonone and he's able to hit a nice throw that took a lot of velocity and he got it there on time run it again on second and six trying to cut back his acres but it's not there instead Jaquan Johnson is a Miami along with Shaq quarterman so third down here for James Blackmon making his third career start replacing DeAndre Francois was injured in the opener against Alabama this is a big third down and in a normal game it might be fought on territory but not in this game it's all been all about field position and Florida State for the most part outside of one drive Miami's been backed up trying to throw it here the left side of the line move just about to ask you so if you don't get this are you punting for sure well now certainly you are if you don't pick it up because you're in third ball number 75 yard penalty third down will be it's a tug of war defensively right now and there have not been many plays made by either offense so I'm definitely thinking field position is as important as anything else now that they're at third and 10 I wouldn't be shocked to see them actually run the football with Patrick who's had a nice game today depends as Jimbo Fisher's confidence in his quarterback drawing it did that a lot in the first half they let him throw it though in the last third domine threw a touchdown pass he'll throw it here and he's got a first down that laser what a great throw in a great read by Blackmun seeing rotation and flow finds this window right around number 33 Trent Harris for Miami that was an absolute missile coming out of the hand of James black not like flames on it broke that but I haven't seen anything thrown like that in the playoffs for baseball going on black men throwing it out here and it's track was set behind the line they haven't signal yet whether it was a forward pass Murray was a smart play to jump on the ball and it looks like they're gonna say it's was a backwards past so it's a loss of four on the play no Greg and Dave go back to our discussion with Jimbo this week and he talked to us about how he thinks completion percentage is overrated he puts more stock in whether or not you make the key play at the key moment when it matters most and that last third down throw right there to audit eight was a prime example of what he was describing to us when describing James Blackmon and let's keep him perspective the defense he's going against these Miami defenders are absolutely outstanding he's been up to the task so far on second and 14 acres beautiful move by Akers a helmet goes flying off at the 25yard line and it's acres he lost his lid he's gonna have to come out for a play that's the second time that acres helmet has gone up come off but he took this look at that little stutter and to get vertical that is a big time move there at the line of scrimmage it was well defended just a missed tackle by the Cain defense they shook Pinckney and then it was for turning that hit him up I knocked the helmet off third and eight from the 25yard line would be about a 42 yard field goal try from here for FSU and they're gonna just run Patrick and go get tackled at the 21 so it's a gain of four and so Ricky acquire his brother obviously played here had some trouble in the NFL was cut by the Bucs picked up by the Bears and it was released again Ricky's been solid this year making eight straight coming into the game and then may want earlier in this one so be a 38yard attempt to give Florida State Malik no problem for a while pressure didn't get to the sophomore Ricki and while making his tenth consecutive field goal splits the uprights to get the Knowles at three point lead I think I had to knock off the unbeaten canes Tyler's kick sails out of bounds it's a touchback let's good ad man at ECU carrying the torch right now for the big 12 Oklahoma losing Miami has led in each now of the last four meetings losing the previous three in fact the Canes have not beaten Florida State since 2009 so a lot on the shoulders of quarterback Malik rose here at the Hurricanes has played better in the second half after just 416 showing the first down from the came 25 Rozier pulls it down gets leveled as he throws and he completes it to Barrios who's made every play for Miami today a 15 yard pickup what a great throw by Malik Rozier getting him outside the pocket he has a defender barreling down he knows he's going to get hit he delivers a strike to a security blanket Barrios on the over round wellexecuted great drive start for this hurricane offense see five touches today for barrows he had twelve fall of last year and fad looks like he might be coming on a bit there he is number four the Florida State lazier recognizes it and wide open is earned in the tight end in the Florida State Territory still farms that have been there all the way down to the 22 it's a great job by Malik Rozier again recognising the vacated space on the left hand side as a result of the corner and finding big completion 37 yards here's turning that again down inside the 15yard line remember last year David and Joe ku was the goto guy at the tight end position he was a firstround draft pick of the Browns and so earned that has become a popular target on this Drive and the season has been incredible answer to this point by this Miami offense 61 through the air second one yeah he finds Running Room inside the 10 it'll be first and goal for the Caine's Walton went down awkwardly wrestled to the ground by Jacob Pugh Walton battling an ankle injury has not been a hundred percent this year they stuffed it out we saw him on special teams make a big tackle he definitely got rolled up guys but this time it's the right side there's another hurricane down can't see the number look at Walden as he goes to the ground very awkward the way he landed in more time see that right leg kind of roll under the defender pew and to seize okay certainly favoring that right leg though as he gets assistance being helped off the field and then right guard LaVon Donaldson true freshman was shaken up as well for Miami coming up tonight following our game from College Station the number one team in the country will be on display and boys Alabama looked incredible the last two weeks can a tide do it again against Texas A&amp;M never am the only loss was against UCLA a game they dominated for most of the game and just collapsed in the fourth quarter but can they keep up with the time it's gonna be a tall order we all remember Johnny manziel's performance as a freshman in 2012 nothing at this point of the season has made me think Kellan Monde resembles Johnny Manziel so it's going to take a superhuman effort from the true freshman she got Homer in four teams at Walton to get Cory gainer a true freshman in Fort Donelson and just left with an injury first and goal for my at the Florida State Senate Keynes looking to take the lead on this Drive rozier gonna take off and he gets to the line of scrimmage in the navy yard he lost his helmet how about this he's gonna have to come out for a play you lose your quarterback unless you burn a timeout here I was Mark Richt and handle this does he call it timeout it's a critical down and Mark Richt and he is he's gonna call Chuck he's going to yeah but how about the hit bike by Matthew Thomas what is that targeting on Thomas I mean the helmet came off but do you call a penalty on Florida State there watch the hit by Matthew Thomas that dislodge an element I mean targeting his forcible contact to the head or neck area of a defenseless player and to me that looks like targeting I know it wasn't called but targeting calls can be initiated from the booth so by the letter of the law that makes me think that it's targeting I don't see any officials scrambling to a headset to take a look at it I'm with you I think that should have been on Thomas who is the leading tackler for Florida State the replay replay booth were being told has informed the officials they thought that was to the back of his shoulder I disagree looked like the head or neck area to me so brick often to burn the time out to keep Rozier in the game and it's a big moment for this young man early in his career a junior but not a lot of stars under his belt his career can be defined by the next five minutes Rozier to the air lobs it ends our burials we've got a touchdown Miami back in how about this kid Braxton Barrios has made every play for the Hurricanes today what a stud let's make sure he secures it of course clearly inbounds feet down ball doesn't moved touchdown canes what an answer after all the momentum seem to have gone to the sidelines of the Seminoles incredible stuff right there from Barrios and Rozier we touchdown the previous play well they didn't review the targeting which I thought they should have and yet they're gonna review what looked like at least from our vantage point a clear catch by Barrios number two a Florida State blocked an extra point and last year's gained win by one he's got the ball I think the fact that he chooses to roll over to secure the football is really what stands out here what a remarkable job by Braxton various and Greg how he set up the defender initially oh man oh man but so there wasn't a ton of room in the back and he hesitated yep who's got his feet he got it down in the back of the end zone yeah this will be confirmed at the review early on the field is confirmed touchdown 3.96 GPA in finance entrepreneurship and making big plays against Florida State that's his greatest major right now semifinalist for the Campbell trophy the academic Heisman he scored five touchdowns in four games he had two touchdowns all of last year makes it a fourpoint Miami game remember is 3 nothing at halftime a lot of points here in the second half tonight after Cal and Washington witches on ESPN you got Sports Center at night with stand let Linda cone from LA all the college football highlights plus what's going on with McIlroy's Dodgers and be a preseason NFL news everything else SportsCenter tonight also streaming live in the ESPN app great games already today from college football and more to come on ESPN at ABC tonight Michigan Michigan State at ABC am Bama on ESPN coming up next every week every week you have incredible games and you have guys that aren't talked about unsung heroes and this year Braxton Barrios went from an overlooked slot receiver rarely used to perhaps Miami's best play maker and certainly today their most reliable target still a lot of time though for Florida State and they will start on their 25 quite a day for the senior this is perhaps the biggest play of the game the punt return Miami's offense hadn't done much to that point he sets him up and then on the next snap he catches the back shoulder fade in oneonone similar route fade from the slot position and he falls down right in the back of the end zone to give the Canes the lead incredible stuff from the senior and we talked about his academic outstanding accomplishments but enough time here for Florida State to march down bringing pressure and that passes pot is oh we had the touchdown earlier out near the 40yard line as we check in with that name we'll Miami hold on Adnan Florida State with a good play to start this drive up to its 39 yard line Blackmon to throw again here's Patrick Patrick able to break a couple tackles and just power his way here the line to gain he's playing hurt as well shaken up in the first half trying to fight through the pain here in this rivalry game tell you what it's been physical today and man it's been fun to watch James Blackmon the freshman just watch Malik Rozier go right down the field for the goahead score he says now I get my chance off to a good start with two quick completions both guys making the first starts in his rivalry game has really settled down since that time Akers gets the call and picks up the first down almost like they're feeding off each other both guys settling down when in the first half they really struggled to throw the football just complete passes if you combine the two on the last couple drives there are 11 of 12 between the two of them and they are really on fire these two quarterbacks trying to lead their team to victory and stretching up that neck of Rozier after he took that shot near the goal line Blackman pumps runs and gets positive yardage smart decision that's what Jimbo Fisher talking about with us yesterday he's just grown by leaps and bounds in that regard yeah we saw some mistakes earlier made the right call there you're gonna have some peaks and valleys as a freshman you're a young player everything that you're seeing you're seeing for the first time but it's how you respond to the negative plays and how you continue to ascend that to the positive plays staying consistent is the most important thing for this young kid moving forward only one incompletion in his last three possessions a huge place this one goes for 15 yards as Tate slow to get up Tate's staying in though left shoulder injury against NC State caught the gamewinning touchdown last week and wants another one here with Florida State on the move inside three to play on the Miami 31 yard line Blackman has to step up wrapped up in sack at the 37 Trent Harris takes him down thank me at pressure initially for Miami as a bigtime play by this Miami defense this offense for Florida State was getting into a bit of a rhythm and they in their ears back and they get after the quarterback to set Florida State behind the sticks it's a great job by this pass rush from Miami but none of us should be surprised they're one of the best in the business and affecting the quarterback official team out there making autant eight leave the field so that will not be charged to Florida State take doesn't want to come out bigtime players don't but the camp on the line it could potentially be it a big move by this officiating crew I mean Tate is their best playmaker offensively and although he hasn't been used as much today his size and his ability to make contested acrobatic catches makes him a massive weapon so after the 7yard loss they're backed up at the 37 yard line of Miami Blackman hangs in the pocket and it's filled in by Murray and nuni is near the 20yard line Johnson with the hit gain of 15 so it's third and short how do you handle this your Jimbo Fisher it's obviously four down territory knowing that it's a four point game a field goal does nothing for you so I'm running the football number three can make and acres gets the call and able to muscle his way past the line to gain the ball comes out it's in the arms of Macintosh but they rule them forward progress was stopped at the touchdown first half for the state minute 45 to go in two timeouts will stop the clock to reset the change column on your offensive line to make a big play right there no good no indecision by Jimbo Fisher you nailed it Greg give it to the young freshman you've got a true freshman at tailback a true freshman at quarterback and a muchmaligned offensive front that right now is playing their hearts out the most important portion of the game see if they give it to him again playaction there's a receiver was stolen decide on he lifts his left arm because of the shoulder injury Andre Francois out for the season congratulating Justin Blackman on another dart Baudin tape potentially backtoback gamewinning touchdowns the point after makes it a threepoint game minute 24 to go two timeouts left great back and forth this time oughtn't a just running to the corner and you're gonna see him sneak out into the flats coming off the motion now there's confusion in the secondary for Miami we've seen this time and time and time again over the course of the first four games of this season inexperience in the back end for the Hurricanes comes back to get them there as they let the best wide receiver for Florida State run free for the go ahead store but how about this true freshman James Blackmon with two touchdown passes here in the fourth quarter completing ten of his last 11 throws just when you think Miami's going to end that straight losing seven in a row this Knowles drive down the field to take the lead again enough time and all they need is a field goal to tie the juice is flowing on a kick off that hit the cross stop let's go to the studio on that man still a minute 24 to go here at man Miami will start on its 25yard line this points jumping now with this Knowles trying to end Miami's 18 overall win streak and extend Jimbo Fisher's record as Florida State head coach eight is what it's all about boys we're here to throw on first down his past tips I swing into play Josh sweat at 6'5 hard to get it over him he's had two knockdowns today another pass coming by Rozier gone to the sideline the barrios he was knocked out of bounds there's no force on rule was just a good play by Myers to push Mariel oh great play by Barrios extending but clearly land huh fridge has been extremely tight in the back end by Florida State these last couple snaps this twominute offense for my antics and the hands just by the 15 they have to get to the 35yard line Wazir steps up and the receiver burials comes free for the first down why not try them again he's shaken up but it's a fresh set of downs for Miami gain of 16 keep in mind you only need a field goal if you're Malik Zaire excuse me Malik Rozier understanding that you still have two timeouts to work with it's not we work the sideline here inside a minutes ago our home running and he's into Florida State Territory got the first down so the clock will stop as they reset the chains 48 seconds to go Miami has two timeouts left will it come down to a field goal again Miami Florida State last year a blocked extra point by FSU on Badgley won the game they're gonna run it again Homer makes a tackle and he is in badge Li's field goal range he's at the 34 yard line again the clock stops to reset the chains and they can hold their timeouts after a 14 yard pickup a Jalees long the season is 50 for his career he's never missed between 40 and 49 yards when's he are going to take a shot receiver falls down theywill incidental content pager that tangled up with McFadden 23 seconds left well played guys I'm standing right in front of that one incidental contact two guys trying to position themselves and so far as McFadden did a great job for C pager to the sidelines they just get tripped up how do you handle this Gregg do you run the football in this situation 23 seconds up try to get a little bit closer I try to throw it I would try to find Roxton Barrios and then potentially run it on third down and try to make the field be a 53yard err from here will sear airing it out pager can't get free from McFadden again 19 seconds left third and 10 got it run the ball right you got to try to get four or five yards here now this is where I run it because not only would I try to make the field goal a little bit more manageable obviously looking at A+ 50yard field goal right now where the ball currently sits but I could also Center the football to for the field goal kicker and try to get it there in between the hashes to make it a little bit more manageable for him from a directional standpoint to Mark Richt will use it timeout keep one more what a shocker it's coming down to a field goal it just it doesn't matter on the year or parties involved in this rivalry it ends up being about the kicking game think of all the great pros that have come out of both of these schools yet it's the kickers that we always end up talking about and you got to wonder what's going through bad Julie's mind as they're trying to get him a little bit closer no doubt obviously the kicking game so huge and emotion in the kicking game and the mental preparation that he's going through on the sidelines can't say I've been there I haven't ever been a kicker I've never tried to kick and I can promise you if I did it would be ugly but him making sure that the rep that he's about to take here pretty soon if in fact Miami doesn't score a touchdown needs to be like every single rep he's ever had in his life to this point and thinking about what Miami might do offensively I still think running the football given the success they've had the last couple times they tried to run it that's what I'd do I'd run it to the right hand side so I can get in the middle of the field Marc Walton not in the game you wonder if it's because of that ankle travis homer though has had some big runs on this try will they give it to him here on third down and ten looking Rozier on the road telling the hurricane fans to get into it and he's gonna throw it on third and long burial sound the tick's breaks the tackle mix up the first down and out of bounds with 11 seconds to go at the 23 yard line it'd be about a 40 yard try from here they have the opportunity to run probably one maybe two more plays that they choose and you see Mark Richt Elma be smart be smart with the football got to take an end zone shot right eye they will take one at this point absolutely here in field goal range absolutely can't get sacked though balls got to come out of your although if you have that one timeout left we'll see her gonna take a shot and it is touchdown with the ground six seconds left there is a penalty marker down at the two yard line my aunty thundering here say they're going to look to see whether Langham made it into the end zone how about that they take the shot Mark Richt uses the clock perfectly there and Malik Rozier with a beautiful throw Langham with the catch is he down well his knees down the question is does the ball cross the plane ruling in the field is a touchdown has to be indisputable video evidence to overturn the Miami score and it's close Wow it is so tough to tell from that angle that's just too tough to tell guys from those angles so difficult to tell I just I don't know how you can overturn it based on the angles that we have it's bang bang but where's there all right that's a good angle but the only thing is you can't see the stripe right you can't see exactly where the goal line begins you can see the pylon and you also can't see his knee from that angle either so you don't know exactly where it went down you can assume but it's really difficult to tell and you can't assume it has to be beyond all doubt to overturn the ruling of a touchdown I think they're still doubt how about Malik Rozier and that throw his fifth career start trying to end a sevengame losing streak to Florida State Miami's longest losing streak in this series and trying to keep them undefeated six seconds left just incredible poise by both quarterbacks here in the fourth quarter these last few drives have been incredible just incredible quarterback play by both sides and how about Langham working against Florida State's best defender not named Derwin James they challenged him and and laying them makes a contested catch and we're gonna see whether or not it's confirmed or not in a second but it appears as though it was the goahead score when I tell you Gregg the throw by Malik Rozier was just so much better than the previous couple of attempts down to the left sideline where he didn't get the receiver a chance so you got Bob Welch the replay officials in Greensboro at the command center they get involved there's the knee can you tell beyond all doubt that the ball does not cross the plane it's so difficult I mean it's so difficult to tell from that angle I mean if I the guests which we can't do if I had the guess it looks like he's short but you can't guess in this situation because the ruling of the field is a touchdown I could really see this one going either way I really could and usually when it takes this long they're looking at something and they see something that would lead me to think that they might be overturning this trying to figure out the spot but this is just so bangbang and based on my judgment if I was the replay official I would call this a touchdown I would to mom of you I would say the place stands I can't confirm it yep but the place stands as called if it were returned that would put the ball on the one Miami would get to use its final timeout and then bring they'd have a decision to make then try the field goal to tie it I know really heavy indecision yeah but I I'm with you I think if you're the replay official Bob Welch and you're in Greensboro at the command center looking at this it's a touchdown you can't overturn that there's not enough video evidence to beyond all doubt say it's not a touchdown three catches all season first time he pulled his number today is the biggest play of the day Miami six seconds away from ending the sevengame losing streak to Florida State badly to make it a fourpoint lead he was thinking he was going to have to come out a try a long field goal said he's just out there for the extra point to make it a four point game just oneonone coverage 11 seconds left Rozier knows he still has a touchdown in his hip pocket but you got to think to yourself as a quarterback let's try to win this thing and regulation and not leave it to chance let me find my big six foot for 220 pound of wide receiver in a oneonone situation and throw a perfect back shoulder and allow that forward momentum to drag the defender into the endzone just a motion all around on both side lines remember to Greg and Tom Mark Richt he's the play caller so he's managing the clock down the stretch and he's calling the plays dialing up to take the shot knowing he probably has the field goal Badgley is very good he's never missed in his career between 40 and 49 he takes the shot and they get the touchdown and who does he go to on third down to extend the drive Braxton Barrios makes the play gets down the sideline sets him up for another set of downs that guy has been exceptional all game long guys get ready for laurels it was two years ago and Mark Rose ears first start Miami with a bunch of laterals ended up beating Duke they kick it deep or two seconds left here's DJ Matthews and he's still going and only could a level that he kept hold of the ball he goes down to the game is over Miami ends the streak Florida State's seven game win streak over the Hurricanes is over Miami stays undefeated the Canes win until a a C on the Bama Anna and Joe tests",

  "transcript": "traveler on the field with conquest playing in the background 11 combined national titles for to the winningest programs in the history of college football first sellout here at the Coliseum since 2013 over 92,000 expected for Texas and number for USC rob stone Robert Smith Heisman winner Matt Leinart the coach Dave Wannstedt here with you to true Blue Bloods in college football colliding last week Texas show they can play with a little Wildcat what are some of the things you're looking for tonight well I want to see how this Texas run defense does against these great running backs from USC talk about the true freshman in Stephen Carr and Ronald Jones they are great Doolin when you look at Texas in the opener against Maryland gave up 263 yards rushing Maryland's got an explosive attack like an explosive running back in tied Johnson he ain't Steve pounds no he's not for me it's how about us cease run defense versus Texas rushing offense for USC they played well last week against Stanford they still yet to put together four quarters of my opinion of dominant run defense they have to do that tonight I think Texas is gonna come out here no matter what quarterback they see they're gonna have to run the football establish the line of scrimmage time of possession keep Sam Darnell then that running game off the field and we may see a little Wildcat too so keep it on USC defense and how they prepare and try to stop that often I'm looking for I really believe that this is a bigger game for Texas than it is for USC emotionally and I think Texas is going to come out ready to go and because of the big win against Stanford you know clay Helton and his leaders of this team they got to make sure that emotionally they get back up again to match the emotion of Texas Texas to have a chance to win this game USC has got more talent from top to bottom they need to take the game to the fourth quarter if you're taken into the fourth quarter you know now it's a returning a chick return of one fumble and interception away from having a chance to win the game so that's what I'd be talking to the team about hey guys we got to sustain it not for a 1/2 or 1/4 we got to take it into the fourth quarter against these guys four straight games with at least 40 points for USC coach do they hit 40 again tonight not in my mind come on coaching dump defense 35 17 I got 45 17 USC I think Texas keeps this game close for a quarter quarter and a half and then USC too tough on offense well I got USC get 250 burger ah oh that's making me hungry no revenge man it's gonna be ruined just for the Trojans tonight 51 to 31 I think that run attack combined with Sam darn 'old not turning the football over is the difference in this one unfortunately it's not the national championship game for revenge poor guy with you Sam thought I'm gonna rush for more yards tonight than you did it probably my whole career coach one thing to keep in mind here Texas with four non offensive touchdowns already this season packed house at the Coliseum over 92,000 on hand for this one we'll see at halftime now upstairs to Gus Johnson and joke lat a sellout crowd of over 90,000 all set to watch a rematch of one of the greatest games in college football history as the Texas Longhorns storm in the hollywood to face the fourth ranked you see Trojans everybody I'm Gus Johnson along with my partner Joel Platt and welcome to La Texas and USC meeting for the first time since their epic battle for the national championship in 2006 at the Rose Bowl and partner the characters have changed yes but the expectations remain the same and that's winning a national title ask for USC they're off to a great start because of one man Sam who hi and yes Sam Darnell quite a player and when this fan base has waited a decade for a national title contender they point to one position and that's the quarterback the leading man and in the city of Stars they've got a star of that position Sam Darnell the leader of USC but he doesn't do it alone he's got a great supporting cast around him namely Ronald Jones he's a sensational back out of the backfield with strength and speed and the newcomer the two freshmen Stephen Carr he is provided a lift 100plus yards against Stanford a week ago that's what has USC fans believing that they are primed for a playoff push here in LA USC beat Stanford here at the Coliseum 42 to 24 the Trojans of mash 623 yards of total offense Darnell threw four big touchdowns and they rushed the ball well Ronald Jones Divakar each with over a hundred yards rushing the USC Trojans ranked fourth in the nation off to a perfect start and here they come Texas stumbled out of the gate week one losing at home to Marilyn but they bounced back in a big way last week against San Jose State it for UT coming into this game Jake a the big question is who's going to be the starting quarterback but we still don't know we're gonna have to see along with you at home they've got a couple of guys that are very good in the pocket their veteran Shane boo shell he injured that shoulder it's a bruised shoulder against Maryland he did not play a week ago he's more of the passer from the pocket but the true freshman who got his debut as a starter last week against San Jose State he brings a little spark to that running game we will see both of these guys here tonight I won't be shocked if Sam bellanger is the one that runs out there first for Tom Hartman and the Longhorns Texas beat San Jose State 56 to nothing in Austin last week and the wall warts field that they fixed some things after that week one loss to Maryland Tom Herman won his first game as the Texas head coach they rushed for over 400 yards this is a series that dates back to 1955 but it's been 12 seasons since they last met on that magical night in Pasadena I think by far it's the greatest game ever played USC was number one team man these guys was holding it down to three years in a row we was trying to get ourselves to that level or these guys was that talked about the talent and two evenly matched teams just going head to head play after play and it came down to really who had the ball last I knew it if Vince got the ball no one could stop him we were close but yeah it just came out shortly now to play you know 11 12 years later a lot of expectations always for both these programs because it's USC because it's Texas both programs I may have so much history finally get to coming back to California and we play some football both teams fighting to get back in being a contender these are the games that help you get there it probably gonna come down the wire like it did about 12 years ago all right welcome back to the Coliseum we're ready for Texas against 4th ranked USC Texas won the toss deferred USC will receive capacity here at the Coliseum 92 thousand 348 the first sellout since 2013 and us he will bring it out of the end zone Bayless Jones he'll get close to the 20yard line before being stopped so as the Trojans head to the field offensive Lee what's the story Joel Clanton when the Trojans out the football well we already told you about the star power on offense but really it's about the offensive line they were fantastic last week against Stanford churning out 307 rush yards on the other side of this Texas defensive front they've been up and down way too many yards against Maryland but then pitched a shutout last week against San Jose State they've got to play great to stay in this ball game first down at 10 at the 19 yard line Ronald Jones glides up in the backfield and they'll give it to him straight ahead pick up a couple before being brought down looks like DJ lock got him and keep your eye on number 77 4sc the left car Chris Brown six five three Ted this young man can play the game he was maybe the best player on the field last week and that's saying something because they had quite a few good performances but he was fantastic from his left dart spot second down at seven years dartle firing out to the far side he has the update Burnett with the burst of speed Brandon Jones there to knock them out about but Burton dead is off to just under brilliant start to his season and that start really was kicked off with a great Rose Bowl ever since that fantastic Rose Bowl performance Deonte Burton Burnett has been fantastic first down at the 36 and they'll go near side to heard a look at for block gets down the sideline and took doze out of bounds as it crosses the 45 and we talked to Sam Donnell's yesterday what made him prescient what I love most about Sam Darnell is that you get the sense sitting with him in a room that he is the same guy he has always been this is the face right now of college football and it has not affected him he's not a changed person running left this time tries to get outside finds a hole cross through it picks up another first down USC they did it last week against Stanford a team that loves to defend the runt loves to run the ball and the Trojans just dominated yeah that's been their Bugaboo in the pac12 does that Stanford team and they physically took it to the Cardinal and trying to do that here tonight against Texas they didn't last week early just running the football switch that up a couple of tosses outside and get things going Jones again this time will run right picks up baby a yard to half on the play as Chris Nelson comes up with a stop defensively for Texas now this Texas front is much bigger and more physical than Stanford now Stanford's got that reputation but across the front you're gonna have guys like Chris Nelson at 300 pounds in Pune for number 95 at 305 pounds much more difficult gusts to get movement against this Texas front than it was last week now talented freshman comes in the game Stephen CAW underneath and it's caught by Tyler Vaughn's close to a first down and when we talked to clay Helton yesterday at usc's facility he said that nowadays with this Trojans program the ones in the twos there's not a lot of separation between the two of them well when when they were great in Matt's era Matt Leinart Sarah Tuesdays were the most competitive day of the week and he feels like they're returning to that point now with the roster that he's built here with the USC Trojans Cedric we're byebye Vala pay I in the game and this would be Malachi he is wrestled down from behind great pursuit by the Texas defense Anthony wheeler coming up and making the play a great play here from wheeler at the linebacker spot he's going to get himself off of the block and make the tackle behind the line of scrimmage that's something that Texas desperately needs to do is force these situations where us he's got to make a decision they've done it and they're going to go for it on 4th so fourth down at 4 at the 37 opening series for USC the shotgun remember he could rock complete and the Longhorns will get off the field that has to be a huge boost for them earlier this game they wanted to embrace the underdog fly around play fast don't be afraid to make mistakes and Deshawn Elliot with great coverage right here on the tight end Tyler petit on the first fourth down he makes sure that he did not backpedal that's great awareness of what the situation is on the field too many times you see defensive backs on fourth down they give ground and allow an easy completion for the first down alright jogging on the field it will be the freshman quarterback and Sam Ehlinger gets the start he started last week against San Jose State a bit more of a runner than Shane boo she'll see how they like to employ the youngster here early first down at 10:00 at the 37 elegant with Tom of data threw the ball off the sideline he's got an open receiver down the sideline Holly Johnson touch it back stutter step it goes down at the 12 but a flag on the play the flag was late down the field certainly not going to come back here's the route top of your screen physical play illegal block in the back offense number 14 so they hit the block in the back which will bring them back here's the blocking back right there down the field excellent call by the official but you go back to the way Colin Johnson got open that's the difficulty Gus when you're facing a wide receiver who's six six to twenty to try to muscle them at the line of scrimmage you were playing with fire at that point first out in 10 to the 25 Chris Warren in the backfield with Ehlinger a freshman from Westlake High School in Austin Valley go Sprint's out of the pocket squares his shoulders watch the throat that incomplete Sam Almaguer went to Westlake High School the same high school as the legendary Drew Brees and he broke all of his records who shell also went there who is the quarterback in the headset dealing with that bruised shoulder the sampling earth is a guy that a lot of people at Texas feel like could be the future in particular with the way that his style fits with what Tom Herman was able to do at the University of Houston he was the number four ranked dual threat quarterback in the country coming out of Wesley as they reset the clock so second and ten at the 25 dream start here for Texas so far here partner the true freshman has got his feet wet with his first completion of the game this time they'll hand it off to war straight ahead and he stopped by the Oh soon the woes who had just a spectacular game against Stanford last week and this was the situation where he was so good third downs an obvious passing situation Chinna knew Oh sue the seniors from Carson California was a man amongst boys last week against Stanford batted down five passes on the night comes in to run the Wildcat he turns it up not yet but gets outside somehow broke a tackle you thought he would stop but he gets out of mouth short of the first down chris Hawkins there to knock him out of play well that second effort certainly made this more interesting and Tom Herrmann told us hey we've got nothing to lose in this ballgame we're gonna cut it loose and they'll go for it on fourth down is Sam Ehlinger now back in the ball game at quarterback fourth down at three at the 18 they need to go to the 15 for a first down Warren lines up in the backfield Gallagher will run it straight ahead us see sittin there waitin no one su who they say is the leader of this USC defense so Texas turns it over on downs coming up Sam Donald and the Trojans oh no once again and here is our craveable moment sponsored by dr. Pelham 11 years ago these teams played one of the most memorable roles ball games ever and I'm back at Ford thriller it was Vince Young dy is touchdown run with just seconds remaining that won Texas a national gym it should look cool the championship and there's Vince Young on the Texas sideline here Robert Jones that lighter Heisman Trophy winner on the USC sideline our colleague at Fox Sports if you watch the pregame show an amazing feature they sat down for lunch reminisce between the two about that game that night the ins and outs terrific job our crew put that together and great story time from those two second down at 7 all the play fake donna sets up deep in the pocket over the middle and he finds mitchell who put hold on Steven Mitchell is coming off on terrific game last week against Stanford but in week 1 against Western Michigan drops by receivers was a concern for T Barton they were so concerned last week with trying to find the number 2 option behind Deonte Burnett he was the one that had established himself they thought they had that was Steven Mitchell but now an easy drop early in this game not the confidence look for them to try to get him an easy catch here soon to get them going very god it's it's at the 24 Georgians need to go to the 30yard line for first down Burnett in motion Donald quickstrike under deep pot first down at 44 SC salient green the junior from Inglewood stop by John Bonnie but it's a gate of 23 I'm this was a bullet from Darnell watch him have to snatch this out of the air and Jalen green came here as a quarterback and show some great hands they're terrific ball from Sam Darnell right out in front of green so he can run through it for a first down good execution there from the Trojans throughout the 47th down Steven gone in the backfield he goes up pause it in at the 35 a gain of 18 and his coaches praise him about his ability to catch it out of the back what you're gonna see is all the vision protects us on that side and they're gonna get the swing route going out to the left side car as you said they praise his hands and they get him the ball early right down the seam terrific route even better catch first out at dead of the 35 bar remains in the game as the pistol back they give it to a running right and he's got huge hole that goes down at the 30 Anthony wheeler defensively Stephen Carr Sports Illustrated calls car and Ronald Jones the best tailback duo in college football you know I Georgia fans would take exception with that but I don't disagree the electricity that these two guys have had through two weeks is second to none second at six at the 31 empty backfield for Garner near side bit so tries to turn it up breaks the tackle it will at Stephen Mitchell nice running after the catch and there was that easy completion for Mitchell I told you earlier in this series they're needing to get him an easy catch to calm the nerves after the drop they get it there and move the chains once more Mitchell looking for a bounceback season after missing the second half of 2016 with a torn knee ligament first of ten of the 18 second series for SC SC is scored touchdowns on seven of eight of its threat zone trips this season to get to the 12 will bond with the tackle I mean the hole that they're creating and have created now for a couple of weeks is so wide I mean these guys are getting a lot of attention but Gus this offensive line has been playing so well we go follow the center Chris Brown the left guard probably the two best over the course of the last couple of weeks second down at four high snap handle Jones beeps his feet churning and when we asked T Martin about his offensive line we said coach how many of them were pros he said all about that's a good feeling if you're a quarterback or an offensive play caller allows T to do a lot of different things and team Martin has done a nice job of getting everybody involved here early whether it's throwing the ball or running a third down at two at the 10yard line Jones lines up behind Arnold Beks is showing blitz they give it to James and he picks up the first down as he gets inside the Texas 5yard line well they're gonna go behind those guys I was talking about check out the left art Chris Brown and the sinner Nikko voila as they doubleteam and they get up to the linebacker that's exactly where they're going on crucial plays and Brown continues to dominate his man at the line of scrimmage first down at goal with the pool Burnett the man Jones again this time he stood up and take it down at the line of scrimmage battle Jones 23 carries 160 yards two touchdowns last week against Stanford this Texas team now they desperately need to force a kick don't want to allow USC to get the momentum here with the first score of the game 11th play of the drive that started at the SC $20 sprinting out throws on the bowling Mitchell the intended receiver one thing to keep in mind we have not seen a field goal attempt from USC all season one scored touchdowns on seven of eight red zone trips on the season chase McGrath the kicker has hit some extra points but not feel those third down at goal at the four tricks at the bottom of your screen Jones the single step back no he did the Texas defense holdings and that brings up fourth down for USC it looks like they'll stay on the field Bolton Hill the corner number five got in there definitely short that ball we may see USC go for it for the second time on fourth down Sean Elliott also in on the play defensively as the Trojans call a timeout another decision has to be made for that gold back after this goal at the one Ronald Jones straight ahead and I think he did what a standby Texas foothillde Shawn who's coming up and making up one check out Malcolm LaRoche from his defensive end spot he's gonna squeeze all the way down there looks to be a hole and then Bank it closes right away and Roach makes the play six for 270 from fountain Baton Rouge Louisiana what an amazing stand here from Texas that's their second fourth down stop of the day already here in the first quarter so the Longhorns deny the Trojans and will now take over at their own one all 3 drives at this game so far that have ended with fourth down stops I think the calls fine both in terms of going for it from clay Alton and the play call the offensive line has been so dominant and it was open for a second but then just closes down so quickly and from that angle with where that ball was in his left hand it just does not seem like there is any angle where they're going to be able to look at this and say that Ronald Jones got that ball all the way to the goal line what a stop from Texas there's where that big defensive front comes in they don't necessarily get pushed back they're not giving as much ground as what Stanford did a week ago to USC and Malcolm Roach comes up with a huge play there for Texas you were on the field before the game watching pregame warmup see when you came back up to the booth you were impressed with what you saw with these law boys hey listen among the coaching ranks everyone talks about like who wins and loses warmups basically the I test you know and I had a couple of the USC coaches shields down first down find a couple of the USC coaches come up to me and say hey Texas ain't gonna lose that warm up anytime soon are they my goodness and they're not losing on the field so far here welcome back to Los Angeles no score Texas and USC let's go to Jenny Taft well Gus we've already seen two of the three quarterbacks available for Texas but coach Herman told me Shayne Michelle is available if needed now I also asked coach Sherman how do you keep your undefeated record against ranked opponents going today he said it is all about stopping the run it is about being disciplined and we believe we have an underdog mentality why not Texas jenny has the best first down and ten at the one for UT Alan in the shotgun in his own endzone and a lagoa pump cake looks long up to Saigon intercept it or is it Jack Jones says he has it and he does this ball was just floated sinem Ehlinger just a true freshman did not put enough air on that ball he threw it late down the field and Jack Jones was waiting for it and then went up to get it and attacked the football to bring it down to the interception and give his offense a short field that is the risk you take when you put a young quarterback in his own end zone and ask him to throw the football down the field that's a precarious situation to be in from any experience level much less his first start on the road in this type of environment and he gives us see a short field so us seals start at the Texas 34 stiva car lines up next to Donald empty backfield the later game faucet certainly a mistake there from darn 'old his new age of college football with tempo offenses I feel like that's one of the skills that has been lost at the quarterback position is the ability to operate the offense and part of that is knowing what the play clock is doing at all times first at 15 at the 39 dardo under pressure steps up in the pocket and will go down behind the line of scrimmage Texas brought some pressure Anthony wheeler finally touching it what I love about the pressure though is that it wasn't all out they weren't running by Donald if you watch how they rushed the quarterback here they do it in a patient way allowing him to make his decision before they go and then tackle him see if you give Sam d'Arnaud LaLanne he's gonna find room create and get the ball down the field excellent job from text they lose a yard second at 16 at the 40 and another flag USC had eight penalties for 90 yards last week against Stanford and Clay help made it to the issue saying that those kind of penalties in a close game will get you beat they got a close one here and they certainly have not been sharp failed on to fork down opportunities and now a couple of penalties hurting them here set it down at 21 and I'll swing it out and another open field tackle PJ LOC Malik ki goes down and this Texas defense has come out helping when you're gonna upset a team when you're gonna play with a team like us see if your Texas your leaders have to play their best and the captain of the defense PJ Locke is certainly a guy that's playing well so far flying up making the tackle third down at 25 now the pea that is Steve and the Texas 39 a 10yard game Anthony wheeler with the tackle I mean what a win for the Texas defense this powerful and potent offense has seen the ball three times we've gotten nothing out of it no points on the scoreboard and in all three of those drives partner they were in plus territory across the 50 and one of them down inside the one read Petrovic comes in to punt it away he'll stab at his own 47 hip he'll max the returner for UT that one dribble back takes a bounce and goes into the end zone for a touchback Texas relying on their defense the Longhorns dodged another bullet their confidence is growing they'll have the ball on offense right after this team to play in the first quarter Longhorns with the football they've turned it over once they've reported only one first down but it's still a bill bill game and this is where they got to establish the run that's the weakness of the USC defense is their rushing defense it's time for Texas to try to establish that run game or is that at 10 to the 20 yard line for Texas it's a quarter that's not a gate about a yard and a half the sophomore from Katie why she agreed with example for SC this offense is rushing the ball for 252 yards per game that's best in the big 12 meanwhile usc's defense 109 thin the country stopping the run at just over 216 yards per 406 yards rushing six rushing touchdowns last week against San Jose State second at 8 at the 22 but a San Jose State no they're not forget you know why they got dudes keeping it spinning goes down around with 25 Jack Jones those option plays kind of like a triple option out of the shotgun they're too slow developing in particular for the speed of USC defense and now Eleanor the young quarterback in a precarious spot obvious passing situation here third down five of the 25 after the 4minute motion that ball popped loose does s/he have it yes they do another turnover for the long haul you're going to watch the motion go across Ehlinger follows it with his head and he was not looking at the snap when it was snapped by sack Shackleford second turnover of the game for the USC defense just a lack of concentration and again this is a true freshman in one of the biggest environments that you can possibly have in college football he's in the LA Coliseum and a sellout 93 thousand strong I can't imagine the anxiety and nerves that are going on in this man's chest and head jochen's take over at the Texas 22 a fumble recovered by the defenses under further review we saw the replay several times I certainly didn't see anything partner that would have constituted another look I mean to overturn a fumble recovery you've got to see such a clear recovery and possession from deed bill and IDO is our rules analysts up at the booth with us Dino what do you think yeah the only thing they could be looking at here is the recovery of the loose ball it's clearly a backward pass it goes into a pile I haven't seen anything to overturn the call on the field it should stand at that point Dean or we're watching that replay I mean to overturn this you would need clear video evidence that Texas recovered the ball and unfortunately at that point it's a scrum there is no clear video and no clear look because at that point that's exactly what the replay booth says is just no video evidence and boy that's got to be a terrible feeling force a Mellinger we will see how resilient this freshman quarterback is after turning it over twice in the first quarter darnell seven of ten 81 yards is started at the Texas 22 Jones makes it back pocket stupid slumped down Malka brooch with the tackle after a threeyard pickup this texas defense has answered the bell already tonight several times here in this first quarter can they do it again they're doing an excellent job on first down stopping the run it gives them a chance here in these more obvious situations in second along second at seven at the 19 watch Mitchell at the bottom of your screen he knows how to get open Darnell pumping the triple sacked at the 30 this Texas defense came to play Anthony wheeler and that takes us to the end of the first quarter nobody giving Texas a chance in this one but so far the Longhorns say hey that's alright start of the second quarter here at the Coliseum USC faced with a third down at 16 at the 28 remember the Trojans are ranked 16th in the nation in scoring offense at 45.5 mirgain Texas shutting them out so far Ronald Jones lines up in the backfield out of the gun d'arnot to throw it under pressure fire that ball thrown behind tyler petit and it looks like USC will punt it away once again at Texas we'll get off the field this Texas defense doing a great job John Bonney number 24 this is excellent coverage see how he doesn't freak out when the eyes of the wide receiver Tyler petit go back to the quarterback just stays with him perfect job now they'll attempt a field goal chase McGrath comes into a tip watch from 46 yards away he has not attempted a field goal this season hooked it no good I don't know about you Parker but something feels different about the Texas and it's their defense they are playing some serious defense right now we have not seen this in a couple of years where Texas is tackling well they are in their gaps they're playing fast they're playing for each other this first quarter and the first moments of the second has been owned by the Texas defense the only fear I would have if I was a Texas fan is this is an unsustainable effort they've been on the field far too long so far in this game over 12 minutes of that first quarter let's see if this offense could get things moving as Jerrod her comes in a quarterback he's got blinding speed first down at 10 to the 28 herd runs it can't get through the hole some serious hitting going on down there Cameron Smith Neal sefa hit on the play how about Jordan he'll Zeppelin number 56 and Jordan is a backup he's playing for the injured John Huston as we have an injured Texas player on the field in yosef Connor Williams is down start of the second quarter back to Los Angeles right after this here are the go RVing sights and sounds from the amazing atmosphere here at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum opened in 1923 its boasted two Olympics 32 and 84 hosted the 2028 Olympics capacity most of 93,000 Donner Williams gets off the field Texas struggled this season they lost to offensive lineman for the season already does she what they've done is they've moved the right tackle Tristan Nicholson over the left and Denzel Okafor number 78 comes in at the right tackle position Gallagher back in at quarterback second down and nine with dive forward gobbled up by Cameron Smith you know this offense needs some confidence certainly they have not been able to establish the run Mellinger has made a couple of mistakes now missing the snap through the interception but more than anything else their defense needs a rest even this early in the game and that's what this conversion really is all about is making sure that defense can stay on the sidelines even for a few minutes longer they're down at six at the 32 over the better and it first down well done little Jordyn Humphrey I love his story John little Jordan little Jordan thing is that his real name yes that is his real name his older brother wanted to name him Michael when he was born for Michael Jordan and his mom said now we'll just go with little Jordyn little Jordan Humphrey and he's not so little by the way six five to twenty five nice conversion there South Lake Texas first at 10:00 at the 39 and they'll hand it off the ward and second effort we're getting a couple of more yards but there is a flag on the play yeah they're gonna get a facemask here on Noah soo trying to back into him grab him on the facemask got the turn of the head easy call from the officials and now Texas has got something because this is not about momentum I always felt like on the field it was more about rhythm and it could just be one third down conversion that gets you rhythm offensively and now a penalty in there in plus territory pile quarter Jags in erotic back first at ten at the SC 42 as a receiver this time it's Lorenzo Joe the senior from Abilene and he'll pick up fool and USC was all over Sam Ehlinger in the backfield and he hung in there even on that roll to the right hung in there and delivered an accurate ball on the outside so first time I've seen him really climb second down at six at the 38 Banagher you see designs to break it back very good pursuit by the USC defense Malik Dorton leading the way that zone read right now was a Mellinger it's too slow developing you USC speed just eats that up even if you think it's there or the scheme suggests it can be there it's too slow for this fast defense and now Ehlinger again will be in the pocket on a third down and long situation they need 7 at the 39 empty backfield for elegant with time looks down to feel incomplete no flag on the play intended for Colin Johnson and it looked like Vermont Marshall may have held the bump of it yeah I'll go a step further than may he absolutely held him and mom Marshall number eights got his hands all over the Jersey he held him right there that should have drawn a flag for defense him holding and that should be a first down an absolute missed call by the officials and a big one Ehlinger knows it and everybody wearing burnt orange in this stadium knows it as well so Michael Dixon comes in to punt it away a Janey Harris is the deep Bend Dixon a preseason allamerican opposite in the air it's about and down is inside the five but along the one's jochen's we'll have to play with along fields no spoilers second quarter Ronald Jones Stephen Carr get it going you see right after this here in Los Angeles set the quarter action time now for the Winnick duo sponsored by whoops wagon why settle for an SUV when you could have an SUV W so far this season has been now running back duo and we'll see if the Trojans can get them loose here tilt it start for the three yard line Malik ki trying to hop through the hole and he'll be knocked backwards Gary Johnson first man doing last week us seed lived in second and short third and short and that has been a totally different story tonight USC is run the ball now 17 times for under two and a half yards per carry credit goes 100% to this Texas defensive front no gain on the last play second at Ted Donald will throw it out of his own end zone up the sideline Mitchell had to turn he was open trying to go down the field out of their own end zone we saw Eleanor make a mistake on an interception what happens to you as a quarterback is that the clock the internal clock in your head gets speeded up I thought on that played Arnold threw the ball a hair early and that's why it went to the outside when it should have gone to the inside it would have been a big completion to Mitchell so a third down and ten at the three then the Texas defense get off the field again here comes a blitz dartle rolling Darnell scrambling d'Arnaud unleashes it cut bleed these boys from Austin art get at it on defense they came in here with that nothing to lose mentality and they've played like it forcing darn 'old out of the pocket good pressure and then they maintain leverage not allowing him to run down the field and the coverage down the field was also excellent and now that offensive series changed field position and what does the defense do they also changed the field position forcing USC to pump out of their own end zone butter Ovitz standing in the back of his own endzone his second putt of the game usually see a lot of good returns after punt situations like this pillbox is the deep man at midfield hotel call the timeout USC flinching up it eleven national titles between USC in Texas but zero points here at the Coliseum in the second quarter Rob stone with you coming up on the State Farm halftime a Hail Mary effort in Gainesville we're gonna honor Matt Leinart who is honored just a few minutes ago here on the field plus coach wants that joel Klatte is fired up about the quarterback play and it might catch me off guard what's got him so angry I love it he's always fired up about the quarterback play alright but robux punting out of the back of his own endzone Reggie hip hill backs who has a 91 yard punt return for a touchdown he bets that would take the bounce at Texas will get great field position they'll start at the USC 41 yard line let's go downstairs to Jenny alright we'll go down to Ginny a little later she's having some audio difficulties right now so Texas starts first at 10:00 at the 41 I just loved the complimentary football that's being played here in the last couple of possessions Texas offense get themself a nice little drive change to the field position and the defense went three and out gets the ball right back in good field position for their offense first out at ten at the 41 yard line Sam Gallagher the freshman with something to work with this time low snap handle Gallagher steps up in the pocket tucks it it goes down at the 37 the whole body opened that time the low Suat camford smith combining on the tackle now but the important part is that Eleanor didn't force the ball down the field that's what you're watching for for a young quarterback is he forcing the issue and so far Sam is not after that interception he gained four yards second at six at the 37 trips at the top of your screen Gallagher those it down hit trouble tripped up and sacked the whoa sue that front got the job done there youo so again with the pressure this kind has been on fire in the last couple of weeks and just the effort to continue to get to the quarterback no chin and a low Suh has forced the third down opportunity and this is where he made his money last week and he was dynamic rushing the quarterback in third and long number of deflection third and ten at the 41 Gallagher in trouble gets rid of it USC bringing a lot of pressure that brings up Ford's at 10:00 they bring the pressure off that left side to the wide side of the field got the defensive back coming in you've got no suit coming in and they for selling her into a throw that he did not want to make miscommunication is well the wide receivers down the field were actually blocking like they wanted to set up a screen pass Nixon will bunt it away from the 45 a Jane a hair is the deep man let's it go over his head and it goes into the end zone 915 to play in the second quarter Texas fighting don't score from the Coliseum they're always Rocking Gus Johnson Joel Claude I'm so impressed with the way this task it's I have to and it's their effort it's their ability in the tackle and even with their backs against the wall they've been able to play well this is exactly what Tom Herman has wanted his defense to play like in the last couple of weeks he got a little of that last week against San Jose State USC in San Jose State dr. D that incomplete that brings up second down at 10th and Arnold just has not looked the same as what he was a week ago dropped passes in Western Michigan last week they were sensational tonight though look at that only four point one yards per play and only earned twenty plus yards here so farming game second at 10 of the 20 Dargo your pressure drops it off the car Wow making people visit by Chris Boyd after a three yard game this defensive line is playing their face up right now and it starts with pune ford number 95 this guy comes in at 305 pounds this is six footer preseason allbig 12 his effort has been sensational in the big reason why they've been able to force these longer yardage third down opportunities like they have here third down seven at the 23 darnell over the middle tied up petite when in doubt Joel go to your tight end that tight end has been so good for Sam's Arnold so far early in this season and petite who had a nice game a week ago comes up with a big catch there and it was really good coverage on Bonnie again number 24 all over petite but darling was able to hit that ball in the tight space 32 catches at 30 games for petite 35 by hoping he'll that burst that you see from car that's what's so exciting he's one of the few players that on his first step of a carry he can bring you out of your seat take the breath out of your lungs cuz you think to yourself this could go the distance very descriptive Jer take the breath out of your lungs Brown why work when you stop learning from the best second at 2:00 at the 38 yard line and they'll hand it off to calm he won't get it that's because puta Ford the man in the middle from Hilton Head South Carolina I love his size six feet 305 here you go it's gonna tape the offensive line the direction they want and then he just kind of bench presses him off and he's right there for the tackle that is just strength and power right at the nose tackle position what an excellent play there from Poona floor okay third at two Ronald Jones back in the game and running back they give it two strings up cones down again he won't get the first downs a mana hue with the tackle and the Trojans will cut it away again Charles Amana who did a fantastic job Tom Herrmann told us that their edge defenders had to be great here's the edge defender watch how he stays outside he keeps his outside arm three and that's how he's able to shed the block and then bring the ball carrier down to the ground what an outstanding job by omena hew the junior from all at Texas hip Hill maps the deep man remember he returned won against Maryland 91 yards for a touchdown and he's a freshman he won't get a shot here and the ball will be down at the 10 no scores 611 to play in the second quarter let's go to Greg wolf for a game break Gus thanks in little they have fierce up front they came into this week as the best defense in the country giving up only two and a half yards per play and they're limiting Lamar Jackson the explosive one there first down for Ehlinger at his own ten and a fly you get a false start here we'll start offense number 64 it's Jake Macmillan and when you're not using a cadence there's no reason for the offensive line to have some sort of miscommunication the only thing here is they're backed up into the loud end here at La Coliseum where it bulls around them for the first time tonight the noise is becoming a factor right now for Texas Texas with only 14 yards on 13 rushing attempts first at 15 therefore a quarter as the USC defense comes up at Janey Harris in on the play another bad snap from Shackleford and it's difficult enough as a true freshman to play against USC much less get in the snap telling her this goes forward we'll get back to the original line of scrimmage Aman Marshall stops them SC says they have the football really the runners progress with stops they're down and Mon Marshall is the one that made the initial contact on Sam Ehlinger and they were in a stalemate as Ehlinger kind of twist and turn and trying to get more yards but third down and ten fires deep down the field please it looked like Joe may have had a step on Jack Jones but Ella ger unable to put it on him it's a pretty decent throat just better coverage from Jack Jones and he's got that left hand on that left hip what the officials are looking for is though for him to turn him and actually crab and impede the progress he didn't do that so even that little contact of the left hand hand was not going to draw a flag just excellent coverage from Jack Jones who is becoming their best cover guy on the outside boy they had a great one here last year Joe dory Jackson he was fabulous which is why he won the Thorpe Award has the best defensive back in the country and that is Jack Jones who made the play who was on the field now being helped off he played really well a week ago and the coaches raved about how he has come along and asserted himself as a playmaker in practice he certainly started taking that to the playing field as well Dixon three yards deep in his own end zone what we stopped punter and he shakes this one out of bounds at the 40 well this defense has been challenged all night long and we'll see if they can answer the bell again USC's offense has had a couple of different port downs one and the Texas defense was able to hold they have been fast they've been physical they've been corralling Sam Donald one of the best in the country as well as these backs they've had nowhere to run great pursuit and this Texas defense is going to have to do it again in another series for USC starting in the plus territory on the Texas side of the 50 USC six possessions three punts twice stopped on downs and a missed field goal first and ten at the 37 Donald checks down as he swings it out gonna drop by Stephen Carr he took his eyes off the football reminiscent of week one against Western Michigan yeah it's Jekyll and Hyde right now for USC this is the team that we saw on tape preparing for Stanford because this is who we saw against Western Michigan this is not the team that we saw a week ago just handle one of the best programs in pac12 here at LA call scene second and 10 at the 37 they give it the car tries to get outside nice dip on on the boom it's a sideline it puts up a first down Steven car six feet to ten last week 11 carries 119 yards against Stanford man when he can get the edge and there was a missed tackle by me Jay lock on the outside and as soon as that happens man he is explosive getting to the sideline gained 11 first to Ted Ronald Jones replaces it don't deshaun Elliott coming up and making the tackle but puta Ford made the play happen tell you these big fellas up front they're doing an outstanding job Chris Nelson number 97 una for number 95 they are winning at the point of attack they're beating their man getting into the backfield and making life difficult on these great backs from USC that's a loss of three second at 13 Darnell quick stripe Mitchell with a seam and a dive forward get close to the first down marker they shot Hughes with the tackle for you yeah huge play there because it creates a short yardage third down opportunity and now USC still has the run at their disposal he gained 11 on second at 13 32 at the Texas 18 yard line Jones Jones breaks the tackle it picks up the first down on his second effort nicely done Chris Nelson finally pushes him out of bounds there was three Longhorns with a chance on that left side you're gonna see all three of these guys have an opportunity to stop Ronald Jones behind the line of scrimmage and they all kind of knock each other off the tackle and he's able to get a second effort and make a conversion first down at the 15 2:50 to play in the first half Donald look at the left step set touchdown do you take Burnett fernette has been quiet all night long we'll see if he was in it just needs a body part there's his elbow it's gonna be awfully close because the process of that elbow coming down might have hit but the knee was also coming down in bounds it's gonna be close they'll take a look on shore to make sure of it put an effort from Burnett again we saw him lay out last week for a touchdown the optic brunette last week caught nine balls for a hundred and twentyone yards and two touchdowns against Stanford what do you think partner now that knee is down he just needs a body part he needs control a body part and then controlling it through the process of going to the ground which he has I say it's a touchdown Dean blendy know our rules analyst what do you click I agree with Joel it's that lefty remember it's control body part down and then does he maintain control call in the field should be confirmed the yacht tapered net last three games including the roles Bowl prior to this one 29 catches for 427 yards and six touchdowns defense did a great job but when Darnell gets on the move Gus he's so dangerous McGrath for the X support an SC finally on the board six plays uh break 37 yards they sport 216 Darnell is so dangerous when he is creating and he doesn't have to leave the pocket necessarily wants to go left and watch how his eyes maintain downfield and he's not even open speaking of Burnett but Darnell throws him open throws him to a spot that's great trust from darn 'old knowing Burnett can get out there make the catch any does getting himself in bounds that's what is so difficult to defend at 22 the talking to the coaches Joel yesterday they talked about Donald intangible you know he has an ability like a Magic Johnson or a Jason Kidd to look one way and throw the other way you saw a little bit of it there because to the naked eye there was nothing there but Darnell throws it to a spot where he sees an opening he sees things that are not there for normal quarterbacks that's why people are so excited about Sam Donald not only for the rest of this season but for his future ability to improvise and make plays down the field McGrath kicks it away Humphry Foreman are the deep man this is poor man bringing it out of the end zone Foreman hits the sideline in Running Room but grass the kicker makes the play on special teams bucks college football is sponsored by the 2018 Ford f150 it doesn't just raise the bar it is the bar and by element electronics power on the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum the place to be seven and ugly it's been a defensive battle between two legendary programs in a rematch of the 2006 national championship game won by Texas first down for Ella girl 3 of 8 59 yards and a pick Gallagher he'll find hit pilled max he picks up about four but JD Harris the woes ooh combining on the stop important series here for Texas in kind of a two minute situation before the half they'd love to get some points here and take positive momentum in the locker room Texas with all three of their timeouts second down and eight rather the snap false start offense number 75 fiveyard penalty check it out you got Tristan Nicholson remember Connor Williams got banged up earlier in this game that's why Nicholson had to move over there to the left tackle spot vy looking for some points here out of his Longhorns before that second at 13 a Nagar standing strong in the pocket throws down to fear cabo de tolly johnson using all six feet six to pull that ball in and mon marshall Atkin was just all over them I mean look at the contact I don't know how these are not drawing flags but Johnson's able to look back reel it in for a huge completion their date of 28 first down at the 43 eligor again it trouble and goes down major pressure being applied porter gusted with the sack Lord Agustin gets a great first step around the edge and he beats Denzel Oh cover around the edge and he dips under with that right arm to get to the quarterback this is a guy battling a toe injury as well as a shoulder injury that he sustained last week had an MRI giving it a go and gets a huge sack there inside of two minutes in the huddle is brought to you by sofa a modern finance company in this huddle for Texas what they're discussing right now is operation because they're trying to get at least a field goal so they're talking about where they need to get in order to attempt a field goal I would say right around the 30 to 31 2 yard line Sam Ehlinger has got to make sure he's not taking a sack but Josh will roll it their field goal kicker has had some troubles this year he's old for 3 on the year partnerin we're trying to just give him an opportunity to get off the snow second at 16 at the 49 Gallagher settling down and intersect again third sack of today for USC this time or once again it's Porter gusty get playing with a broken toe he's getting around the edge I mean the speed that he's showing an outstanding effort here and again that's a true freshman Mints mistake from Eleanor in these situations in the twominute drill you cannot take sax he's taken backtoback third down 19 at the 48 Christiaan director this time backtobacktoback sacks for the Trojan defense you talk about turning it up this defensive line is absolutely flying around just an excellent job from Christian rector to get that inside pressure right in the face and pelling er that is the worst type of pressure to get for a quarterback eat it up Trojans feed those defensive linemen getting after the quarterback in obvious passing situations so with 33 seconds remaining SC calls a timeout they have one left well that defense had been owning this first half and they do so they're late after that great completion to Colin Johnson down the sideline and then Texas just went nowhere Michael Dixon will punt it away from the 25 the JD hair is standing inside his own 15 Harris comes up to field it on the move of the 20 and goes down immediately nice effort on special teams Malik Jefferson with the town well I tell you what pressure on the quarterback is so important and then they do it on the edge with Porter Gustin then they just did it with relentless effort great coverage down the field Gustin again and then right up the middle again the quarterback has nowhere to go you always see when there's pressure right in his face partner they always panic especially young quarterbacks because they know they've got nowhere to go Dustin was coming around the edge knew Oh soon was coming around the edge and a telling her had no chance on that last play so dargol then the Trojan dolphins take over at their own 23 yard line with 30 seconds remaining and one timeout Donald over the middle watch up the shine this defense lights out jaelyn Green has the ball put on the money and you can see the reaction hands right to his head and Elliott picks it off and finds himself in the endzone this defense has been sensational in this first half and for Texas after that scoring and non offensive touchdown last season the Longhorns have five in three games reception ooh touchdown is under further review they're gonna review whether this ball hit the ground a la Franco Harris the Immaculate reception you see how close it's going to be but that was clearly above the ground on that angle it was close hug him that but clearly above the ground ball those through Jalen Greene's hands and see watch here it gets close right there that double catch yes but clearly above and Elliott takes it in the Texas defense Gus has not played this well in years years this is not shutting out San Jose State these are the USC Trojans that just put it on Stanford last week former head team at the country number for the Heisman frontrunner with great running backs speed on the outside a very good offensive line and this Longhorn defense is taking a tool that's down Tom urban 42 years old in his first year he's six and O against great opponents in his head coaching career coming over from Houston he was twenty two and four and two years with the Coons roll it in to attempt the extra point we're level that's seven Texas fighting thus USC got a little greedy they're taking the time out they could have let the half go with those back to back to back sacks not faulting them for it listen if I had Sam Donnell and those backs and wide receivers I probably would take a timeout as well but that's the risk in particular in a half in which the offense didn't really play all that well because of how well the defense for Texas had played and it backfires for clay Helton and gives all sorts of energy that Texas team as they head to the locker room and as we were talking about rarely do you see Southern California vase the team with athletes just as superior as their own all of us have played pickup basketball right you go to the park yep you know when you're the better player and you know when they're the better player and you know more importantly when you're staying the night I USC finds themselves in a nine i right now in their home field well little pick it away Jones it got Ardi and they'll start from the one davisjones with the gap davisjones take it down at the 37 yard line Brandon Jones with the tackle on special teams for Texas with 10 seconds to go maybe more of a conservative approach here I would guess so now I don't think I would just take a knee because those backs have a chance to go at any time even if it's kind of a throwaway snap so I would expect this ball to go to Ronald Jones just in case they can find a crease Donald back on the field he threw two interceptions last week four on the season coming into this game now one here in the second quarter a pick six Texas calls timeout and I love the timeout and here's why is Texas had a defense out there that was way more of a prevent defense kind of a Hail Mary style of defense I think they thought to themselves hey what if they hand it off kind of how I was just explaining that well if they give the ball to Ronald Jones right there he's gonna gash him for at least 10 15 yards and at that point you're at the mercy of open field tackling one of the better backs in the country so expect maybe a couple of more defenders here for Todd Orlando the defensive coordinator to be up near the line of scrimmage that's what he's talking about he's pointing back to that backfield and that's a smart timeout by Texas what's your impression of coach Urban tell you what he's put together a great staff and he's trying to build an identity for Texas not harken back to some success of the past but build a new forge a new identity and they're starting to do that here in this first half first out ten seconds ago Jones heads to the 45 Malik Jefferson with the tackle coach Herman and the Longhorns should be proud of their performance in the first half especially on defense the offense is struggled and a timeout called by SC with five seconds to go that run went for enough yards now you've got a chance to get the ball to the end zone on a throw gained about seven yards there maybe six and a half very difficult to get the ball to the end zone when you're snapping it from your own 38 yard line but when the ball is at the 44 close to the 45 now Darnell is going to have a chance to at least get it near the goal line so now you're going to try for that Hail Mary type situation Texas sends three men deep to defend what could be the final play of the first half Donald needs time the trouble scramble it checks it down over the meadow Ronald Jones in the open field it's the 56 yards touchdown USC the exact thing Tom Herman was trying to avoid on the snap previous was allowing Ronald Jones to have the ball in the open field Donald with an amazing play to get himself out of the pocket and then the intelligence to just get the ball to Jones in the open field and he takes it in for a touchdown Steven Mitchell credit with a great block down the field after a scoreless first 27 minutes we've got three touchdowns in the last 240 USC hits a lot girl with a 14 to 7 lead there Donald thinks he's going to go left gets out to the right that's the smart play he just gives it to a playmaker and here comes the block Steven Mitchell and it's lights out for Ronald Jones and that's it for the first half with the score USC 14 Texas 7 after a quick commercial break both sent you to Greg Wolfe in the studio welcome back to the Los Angeles Coliseum for to the 7sc on top of Texas Gus Johnson along with my partner to a clap partner the first half was dominated by defenses then all of a sudden with about 240 to go fireworks I know I got literally out of the blue right and some of those fireworks were actually provided by the defense speaking of that Texas defense but these two defensive fronts really owned the first half I was so impressed with the way Texas came in here and play the effort the physical nature on their defensive line they did not allow Ronald Jones or Stephen Carr to get loose in the run game and USC matched him they matched him getting to the quarterback in particular late in that half getting to Sam Ehlinger on back to back to back plays and then the fireworks started first from DeSean Elliott pick six for Texas to draw even and then my goodness how about Ronald Jones he gets loose he gets in the open field the huge assists from Steven Mitchell and that's how we get to a 147 game as we take a look at the Geico firsthalf stats and those total yards for SC 239 looked dominant right now but that Texas defense they played better than that number suggests Texas will get the ball to start the second half here come the Longhorns form it from his own goal line and he finds some space tackle by Bubba Bolden let's go downstairs and check it with Jenny well Gus it was an animated coach Herman coming back from the locker room his first word to me Wow we were unbelievable on defense that is the discipline that is what I've been looking to see from this group I also asked him about quarterbacks a Mellinger because he took some tuffets will they make a change he said not at the moment we have been talking about it but overall everyone on that side of the ball needs to step up because if our offense can match our defense it's a different ballgame all right thank you very much getting first down in 10 of the 24 for you to Nile Porter in the backfield Gallagher and it'll hand it off form it around the corner stood up Dysport word amount marshal with first contact and it's a fouryard game trying to change things up here they were trying to just run it into the heart of that defense and or throw the football with Ehlinger and now in the second half immediately trying to change what's called the launch point and get outside second at six they run it Porter stop thief it to get by USC Russia green welfare all the praise that we've been given the Texas defense and deservedly so USC's defense has been their equal because they have not allowed this Texas Russian game to get on track at all as there is a flag on the field the first enemy of the game that's why it was thrown late over there and clay Helton will get an explanation you talking about Texas running the football at USC defending the run Texas is running 19 times for two yards they're down at five elegant up the sideline at the 45 Colin Johnson hit me with this catch I mean full extension way out in front and hauls it in and secures it through going to the ground that's a sensational catch doesn't get any better than that that's a 24 yard pickup first and 10 at the 47 member Johnson his six six three catches for a hundred yards already for Johnson and the second half just started hands off the porter ajaita yard Chinna to ensue defensively again they call a believe Lyon who checked you know this Texas offense has found something with Colin Johnson he's getting oneonone coverage on almost every plane at six six they're gonna have to keep going to him because he's been the only real consistent offense that Texas heads has had here tonight suck it down at nine at the 46 opening series for Texas here in the second half Gallagher with time back down complete guess who know will shoot Gus you know why this is so impressive is because he stops his rush he knows he's not going to get there and then he times it specifically to bat down the ball I mean just such a smart play from knew so and that's one of the big reasons why this guy is batted down six passes in the last two games third down at nine at the 46 for UT Gallagher survey delivers Oh a beautiful throw our money former with the catch that's a Bella Gert is starting to set it down and you know what helps you settle down best time in the pocket look at all the time he has in the pocket and he can stand in there and throw a strike on the outside young quarterbacks need time to process information in their heads and that was given to him by his offensive line on the last night Ted yard gate first down at the USC 36 keeps it stiff arm dies forward it gets to the 30 so he'll gain 6 yards on the point and the difference between the way they executed that zone read and the way they were trying to do it early in the game is that Elling or early in the game was running sideways off the fake way too slow well there they made an adjustment at halftime they see how he went downhill he got north and south he got vertical towards the defense much quicker hitting play and allowed for some success so much pressure on this freshman from Austin second down at four at the 30 here's the reverse Foreman with a blocker it's allen girl oh that Foreman goes out of bounds at the 20 joules wraps him up but it's a 10 yard game and there's an injured on the field as regime green number 94 physical player all pac12 honorable mention last year so easy to get caught up as a defensive lineman when they have those big misdirection plays get the ball on a jet revert jet sweep to the right side then he hands it off for the reverse and boy it was wide open over there on the other side of the field far side of the field this regime green hablas off towards his bench great junior from LA Sara high school such a good player too that's a that's a big missing piece as he hobbles off towards the bench let's see if Texas get exploited it's been one of the guys that have been so dominant against the run I wonder if they're gonna try to go right to the run game here they do bring in Jerrod herd Gus that's the specialty for him it's that big hurt package kind of like the 18wheeler from a year ago first down at the SC 21 heard it at quarterback runs to his left as he gets back to the line of scrimmage corrector with the tackle so the difficulty in having Jerrod heard in the game is that they have not shown the ability to throw when he's taken the snap so the USC defense can just tee off on the run at some point he's going to have to throw the ball and I would assume it's gonna be right now out of this package if they run it again I venture a guess he'll be four about no game River Bird was the starting quarterback for most of his redshirt freshman season second at nine at the 20 bird steps back flag on the play now heard with some space as he closes on he spins and gets close to the first down marker but there is a fly gonna get illegal formation offense too many players in the backfield fiveyard penalty second down and two just wonder Joel Ellie dirty started the second half three or four 38 yards do you throw off his rhythm by bringing hurt into game they definitely had a rhythm there that motion started when they weren't set too many guys in the backfield which happens when you don't have your normal quarterback because guess who it's it's his responsibility to get everyone lined up it's the quarterback he's got to know what's going on out there herds in there doesn't have the rhythm and they get a flat second at 14 at the 25 allegory underneath Dorian Leonard hop forward four three trying that inside tunnel screen nowhere to go again run inside the side against this USC defense is so difficult because of the athleticism that they put onto the field well that'll make it third down and 11 at the 22 ft backfield fours an elegant no line backers here here comes the Blitz Gallagher picks it up and the drop packs Leonard couldn't hold on exactly where they tried to exploit the fact that USC had no defenders in the middle of the field they try to get that quick slant and Dorian Leonard was unable to come down with it the senior from Longview accurate past this is perfectly thrown it's exactly what you want to do as a quarterback is gives your wide receiver a chance to run for the first down Josh will roll it over three this season also has had a field goal blocked in to attempt at 39 yarder thank good good sign for the Longhorns to start the second half he'll take the three points four point game Matthew McConaughey's says yeah you're okay let's see on top of Texas very good Drive Joel by the Longhorns to get the three points yeah and maybe more important than even the yards or even the points at this point was the time of possession it was so uneven in the first half that drive was five and a half minutes long and they finally established their rhythm for their young quarterback and Tom Herman a lot of enthusiasm energy on that Texas sideline they came into this game feeling they had nothing to lose USC is played tight especially on offense car Jones of the deep man this would go ahead to the back of the endzone let's go to Greg wolf for a game break Gus thanks we go back to Louisville with you you know not all that surprised by that game the way that it's playing out remember Louisville had struggled pretty mightily with Purdue in the wind and even North Carolina in a win and Clemson is not / or North Carolina SC starts from their own 25 false start offense number 72 Athena Andrew Voorhees number 72 he is a true freshman getting in the ball game Shuma a Doga the normal right tackle was dealing with a hand sprain coming into this ball game for he's was gonna split some reps and got a little early start on that play first at 15 Jones no over the middle but net its space and it'll pick up nine Deshawn Elliott with the tackle I mean that wasn't like a quarterback throw that was like a shortstop turning a double play with someone right at his feet watch Sam Darnell in the arm Talent he just takes the ball and boom his hips weren't there his feet weren't with him and still an accurate ball that goes for nine yards actually correction who was a 14 yard game Joel second and one at the 30 clear Jones looking for the first down at he hasn't I was told there would be no math Wow I bet you I'm sorry I said this defense though continues to do a good job even though they got the first down Ronald Jones has not had a 31 at the second level he can't get down you know he can't and and he's having to make his first move in his backfield because of that defensive line Jones 15 carries 42 yards first down at the 37 give it to him straight ahead chopping his feet and have been lucky to get back to the line of scrimmage looks like it's a loss who would afford in the middle of the action as usual along with Gary Johnson yeah he's had a sensational night both Johnson and Pune Fork watch how Jones has to make his first move right there in his own backfield he's having to jump cut behind the line of scrimmage that's a nonstarter for a back you're not going to gain many yards on the night if you're constantly having to make your first move in your own backfield second down and 10 at the 37 after the no game Jones in motion out of the backfield they look his way Mitchell grabs it perfect speed big pickup for Steven Mitchell 19 yards Malik Jefferson stops it they keep using this running back motion because no one is following the motion out of the backfield so there's only two defenders lined up on the wide receiver they send the motion out there and get an extra blocker first out of the 43 car and cop written down hard beautiful open field tackle Brandon Jones for Texas you just gotta love what they've been able to do on the edges because these backs cannot get to the perimeter not a real good block right there by Deonte Burnett but you got a credit Brandon Jones for his ability to pursue and then keep that outside arm free at a time I'll call by the Longhorns 654 to play third quarter fourpoint ball game from LA and Texas as we take a look at our Jeep stat comparison yeah you know Ronald Jones has been so electric all season but tonight has not had anything going only 42 yards under three yards per rush in fact when you look at what Texas defense has done they've held USC to no gain or negative yardage on 12 rushing plays just to give you some frame of reference that didn't happen one time last week against Stanford set the down and jet at the 43 let's see if Donald starts airing the ball out and a timeout called by the Trojans timeout USC their first of the half so while we're waiting for the Trojans to come back on the field let's give you some headlines 2nd down and 10 for Sam darn holding on to a fourpoint lead near side for Tyler Vols Holton Hill they call him Hollywood votes that's his nickname and he's playing in Hollywood and he's playing well tonight he's done terrific in coverage this guy has scored as a defender three touchdowns on the season to pick sixes on the Block field goal return for a touching so third down at 44 SC at the 37 yard line Carr the pistol back they give it to him cuts it is written down shy of the first down at the 35 so in the first half we saw the Trojans go for it on fourth down a couple of times is pulled a Ford continues to play well against the run what does coach Helton do now well you got a lien on what you're confident in at this point and it looks like the offense is going to stay on the field but they have not inspired the confidence that u.s. sees defense has inspired today if I were clay helping I would punt this football try to pin Sam Ehlinger inside the 5yard line fourth down and three doujins going for Darnell under pressure over the middle and it's caught Mitchell and he doesn't get the first down once again the Texas defense denies USC on fourth down three times Holton Hill nicknamed Hollywood show it out in Hollywood have a day young man in the shotgun back to throw Viet worked under pressure one of the most iconic games in college football history fits young putting the Longhorns on his back for a national championship he was certainly invincible that night first down at 10 of the $34 all day to throw into the middle complete that ball thrown low warned the intended receiver Janey Harris on the coverage for us see why they had a good concept there but a Janey Harris closed quickly got to the receiver and then was able to get around him and bat that ball down but again Ehlinger had time to throw it's been a consistent pattern here in the second half second and 10 at the 34 Gallagher near side caught and down at the 40yard line is Colin Johnson Eman Marshall stops it Allen Johnson is a mismatch if I need a play and i'm sam millinger I'm throwing it to Colin Johnson he's six six 220 pounds the lawn marshal a big corner but he's given up five inches and 15 pounds Marshall's only six one two oh five four catches 106 yards receiving four Colin Johnson third and four at the 40 elegant in trouble Gallagher stops delivers an incomplete batted down Neil sefa and the pressure being applied by Cameron Smith and Connor Murphy Cameron Smith the linebacker he's gonna come through on the Blitz and then chase Ehlinger out of the pocket he had been given time but a mistake up front Jake McMillan the right guard he's got to sit and wait for that linebacker and block him to give Ellen her time Alena was forced to escape the pocket and had nowhere to go with the ball fifth putt of the evening for Michael Dixon Janey Harris stands at his own 10 and his fare Khadija 1214 to 10sc 502 good play third quarter the fourth ranked team in America the USC Trojans find themselves in a fight drill flat yeah it's been really all about that Texas defense Sam Donald got loose for one play finds Fernanda back to the end zone but then that defense boat its neck a picks it six from Deshawn Elliott this was the last play before the house six seconds left darlings finds Ronald Jones great block by Steven Mitchell finds the end zone and it's a 1410 ballgame first down at 10 to the 13 playaction Donal sets up deep in the pocket over the middle and Steven Mitchell again and Steven Mitchell will go down to the 39 a 27 yard gain nahshon Hughes with the tackle and Steven Mitchell has been ballin out today Joel he has and they needed to and he dropped the first pass that he got an opportunity to catch and ever since then he's been dynamic found open spaces caught the ball and made plays with it after five catches 72 yards including that huge block to spring Ronald Jones the hand dolphin and pulled a Ford again Texas is just Darrin USC to beat him with Sam Donald they have got so many guys at the line of scrimmage the defensive line has been sensational Puna Ford has had maybe his best game in a Texas uniform I wonder at what point does team Martin just say okay Sam balls in your court let's go chuck it around a little bit with our athletes on the outside second down tonight at the 41 Texas has an athlete's themselves Darnell under pressure Amana who second sack of the gay for UT just a one on one on the outside and remember USC has a true freshman at right tackle Andrew Voorhees is in for chumma a Doga who's battling a hand at hand injury and a mini shoe goes right through him just a bull rush gets to Sam Darnell and USC is in a load of trouble here they've got nothing they can lean on offensively a loss of six third and 15 Donald over the middle and it's caught James trying to find some space and he gets drilled by Malik Jefferson this Texas team led by their defense getting more and more confident as each second goes by I'm a great pursuit and then a just a terrific tackle from Jefferson who is one of the most highly recruited players in the country hasn't quite reached that potential yet but he's starting to tonight Chris defense has been great preseason allamerican Vic narak Nagurski and buckets watchlists fourth punt and it's fielded at the oneyard line not a wise decision but here comes hip held max he'll get close to the 30 not a bad return but I think Greg Wolfe has a better one here's a game break yes I do guess we go to Seattle dump a man Donte Pettis is for real he is a serious player against Rutgers first game of the year he ran one back first and ten at the 28 Gallagher keeps it and I thought it was interesting when we call talk to coaching helping from USC yesterday and he was very complimentary when Tom Herman's name was brought up they said you know you could drop coach Herman out of an airplane somewhere he'd find a bunch of guys and they'd end up score 48 on 2nd and 8th at the 30 well I'm not quite there or just at 10 so coach Elton's got to be proud of his defense but yes Herman's offenses generally do have that potential elegant steps away wants to run as some rule that gets to the 35 Marvel tell this attacker illadvised penalty here from Texas way down the field wide receiver through a defensive back down Giroux a penalty flag that's Devon doom Rene number six watch right here he just kind of shoves him I don't know it's hard to see if the play was still going or if that was after the play which then drew the flag but if the play was still going and I don't see why that would draw the play personal foul unnecessary roughness offense number six so they deem that it was after the play it's so tough to tell because again that was just 35 yards down the field that point you just want your wide receiver to make a better decision and just lay off of the defensive back Ehlinger was clearly going down on the play so that'll make it third down at 18 at the 24 Texas now the girl in trouble steps up with a lane and he crosses the third he gets up to the 33 maybe the 34 13 yard pickup on third and 18 gutsy run was going to be very difficult to get to the chains this rush again getting to Ehlinger forcing him to get out of the pocket this guy is battling now this is a true freshman in his first road start of his career he's hanging in there tough and an injured player for SC Jack Jones Jack was down in the first half limped off battling some cramps and he's down again here in the third quarter he was a high school teammate with the opposite corner Aman Marshall prep allamerican like so many are here at SC it's been playing terrific football little undersized only 511 170 pounds back up in a special teams player a year ago but has really risen to the occasion here as a sophomore so far early in the season so Dixon funny for the sixth time a Janey Harris standing at the 15 but a flag on the play as he gets the midfield if it stands it's the first down it's not gonna stand there was a hold right in front of the white hat land Clark djay lock the nickel back he was on the right side right where Dixon was running here's Locke here's you gonna get the hole and its really obvious as soon as the place starts to develop and he takes up watch PJ Locke he just throws the defender down to the field and that draws the flag right away excellent call by the official tough to take for Tom Herman in the Longhorns so herman gambling doesn't pay off they'll have to punt it this time from the 10 Harris up to the 31 great special teams play by the University of Texas as Malik Jefferson was the first man to it Antoine Davis also in don't forget to check out breaking the huddle with Joel clap my partner on Facebook live Wednesday at 5:30 p.m. Eastern sponsored by dr. pepper what do you got this week Bart man who's got the week of upsets and even some of the teams that were highly favored like Michigan playing air force strung a little bit with that triple option we're starting to see this play out now in particular like in the ACC Clemson becoming kind of a clear favorite in the ACC trying to become a repeat playoff team first down Darnell picks truck who has his receiver Lewis and Lewis picks up the first down Joseph Lewis a freshman from LA those are the big biggest chunks of yardage that we've seen in the second half is when Darnell just pitches it out to his wide receivers and they run oneonone against the defensive backs and that'll take us to the end of the third quarter SC with the ball and the lead 14 to 10 over Texas as we take a look at the scoring by quarters Texas with the three points 14 to 10 Gus Johnson along with my partner Joe part he's kind of got a heavenly glow going on there as he like the late Rick James of the they say it's my aura if you would have said that the score would have been 14 to 10 heading into the fourth quarter st with only 14 points and they averaged 45 coming into this game what would you candidly I wouldn't have believed you you know I thought SC the way they played last week you know they were establishing themselves as a dominant team but this is what we've seen all night Gus the defensive front 7 for Texas has been too good for USC they've been physical they've been fast and more importantly they've tackled well this group was embarrassed against Maryland in week 1 a home loss in which they gave up way too many missed tackles too much yard in the run game since then they've only given up 14 points you talk about pride they've got some second down and 11 at the 40 Donald looking Donna scrambling steps up crosses the 45 up to the 47 a six yard pickup Hughes and wheeler combining on the tackle yeah and Todd Orlando the defensive coordinator protects Asst he is known as an aggressive attacking style defensive coordinator we've seen that here tonight this is the guy who is the architect of all those upsets at Houston in the last couple of years for Tom herm in the head coach and he's orchestrated a terrific game plan here tonight against the Trojans third down at five at the 46 Burnett in motion he's been quiet lately lines up in the backfield they look his way d'Arnaud over the middle caught by Boggs but he goes down immediately Holton Hill with a burst of speed along with Malik Jefferson check out Malik Jefferson he's a linebacker but at the snap he's going to back up almost and he's just surveying surveying and then he sees the underneath route and he explodes to make the tackle what a stop there from Jefferson Hemphill maps will go back to returning as it Texas defense once again will give their offensive football Oh my quickness Hemphill maths dangerous play the ball Joel was heading into the end zone illadvised get a little greedy took a punt for a touchdown week one made a nice play in the last but but he's got to be smarter than that he's a freshman the fourth rent USC Trojans with a fourpoint lead over Texas Longhorns will start at their own two yard line let's go downstairs to check it with jenni yeah Gus to defensive injury updates for USC r\u00e9gime Green is out it is a left ankle sprain in linebacker quarter Gustin who played in that first half yet those two sacks he is out has a walking boot on his right foot remember Gustin and those two screws put into his big toe on Wednesday playing through them alright thank you very much first out at 10 to the 2 yard line yeah Nagar another low step picks it up with time you saw a strike to Johnson turns it up it gets to the 20 boy great time in the pocket that the offensive line provided but remember the last time they were in their own endzone they tried the go route and it ended up being picked off Ehlinger drops back they faked the go route Johnson drops out and it's an easy completion that's a great call as Jerrod herd checks in now as the quarterback for the Longhorns right he's got to get around the corner yes he does that goes out of bounds Neil sefa chasing about about but it's a four yard gate does seem though like we see herd come in the ballgame right when Ehlinger maybe is establishing some rhythm and now Elling are back into the game of a second and six situation as a former quarterback I can just tell you that I would hate having to jog off the field and then jog back on I would feel like my entire rhythm was lost second at six at the 23 Gallagher the throwing winds up down the field and incomplete our Bonnie Foreman had a step but Janey Harris was trailing boy comes in there takes a shot right down the field just overthrown we've seen a couple of passes down the field over from overthrown from Ehlinger but I love them taking a shot there but it does provide this precarious situation now the USC has not been able to get to the quarterback in the second half remember Porter Gustin is out he's one of their best outside linebackers you've got a block at Chinon Oh sue the outside linebacker and the low part of your screen third down and six Gallagher and incomplete and a flag on the play his offside on USC 27 there at ga Harris trying to time up his blitz but boy that gives just a free pass for Texas who would have been having to punt the football now Clancy Pendergast up to down something up on a third and 1 where they can still run the football at the 28 aisle Porter the runner for UT oh and he snap it once again a litter wasn't ready Gallagher picks it up throws and he complete on third down and one selfinflicted wounds and it's the second time we've seen the snap surprise Ehlinger everyone else was ready for it Shackleford snaps it back he's a sophomore from Belton Texas Ehlinger is lucky that that ball hopped up to him and that he was able to get outside the pocket and throw it away that could have been disastrous but again the second mistake on the quarterback Center exchange Dixon from the 14 and Janey Harris the deep end and he has it at the 2014 210 Donald holding on to the lead 1138 to play in the fourth quarter 14:10 USC 1138 to play fourth quarter from the 20 darn old wives up down the field valus Jones did that go through his hands Joel boy it looks close Bayless had to lay out leave his feet to try to catch this one he is a burner and yes that was right there you can't throw it any better down the field if you're Sam Darnell on that deep post Bayless has got to catch that ball dialed up perfectly by T Martin executed perfectly by the quarterback second down at 10 of the 20 Donald dances out of the pocket nice time underneath an incomplete it's so difficult to throw a screen pass from the shotgun because you have to you you fake that little pause you see when you're actually under Center you can drop back four or five steps and then pause as if it's a true pass then you can start to retreat as a quarterback but from the shotgun that element of surprise and almost like illusion is avoided and the defense can read it almost instantaneously in offensive ly SC it seems like they've been out of sync the entire game center run game been taken away third at Ted Donald steps up in the pocket wants to run Donald gets the first time he's elusive this favorite player is Tom Brady but he sees a little bit of himself in Aaron Rodgers well this is silly oh we don't talk about him as a runner necessarily but he always makes plays with his feet and that was another example of that it was awful close though because as he's being dragged down that ball is just across the 30 what a great play first out Darville underneath a complete Steven Mitchell the intended receiver that time Darnell just rushed the throw and it was well behind his receiver Mitchell we see him a lot off of that little run action fake just rise up and throw the ball he doesn't get his feet set and he doesn't get his front shoulder pointed towards his throwing spot in that time it hurt him second at 10 Donald sideline that would say hi intended for jaylen green rigs up third down and long well you see the difference now with USC last week they ran the ball 25 times on first down the gusts they can't run it not against this defensive front they've been too good too fierce up front forcing USC to throw the ball on first down leads to these situations long yardage situations on third down third and 10 to the 30 zone to the backfield those in motion dargah looks that way Eliott down at the 25 that Texas defense moving grooving this is the worst throwed Arnold is made all day long Tyler petit the tight end is wide open in the middle of the field Arnold doesn't get his feet set he throws it off his back foot it sails on him and that's an easy pick for Deshawn Elliott his second of the game Darnell was out of synch the entire set of downs missed on first down missed on second down and all right all right all right Texas with the second pick of the night first out at 10 to the 25 to the Longhorns can they pay it off they need a true freshman to lead them and a fly right side of the offensive line moving false start offense number 78 fiveyard penalty first out both teams are dealing with backups at the right tackle position both teams have had those right tackles start early causing false starts first at 15 late clock at seven Gallagher hands it all border around the quarter bhasu coming up with the tackle after the four yard game Neal sefa as well Texas is just reaching for anything that they can try to have success with the most successful thing that Tom Harmon has had on offense is Colin Johnson number nine the mismatch that he is as six six to 20 in particular in this part of the field is huge he's in the slot Gallagher swings it out they want to pass it no hip he'll max takes it it's Chuck down but picks up a first down chris Hawkins with the tackle this is amazing execution now I think they want to throw the double pass but look at USC they all take off deep down the field and that's a great job by him he'll Matt's remember he made the port decision on the punt return brought it back from his own end zone there he makes a great decision tucks it runs it for a first down Texas with a first down at the SC 13 laughs a ella girl sets up looks backside fires and incomplete warned the intended receiver out of the backfield here is that bucket of tricks you see the double pass attempt they have to run it for a first down now they tried a little roll out with Ehlinger and trying to slip that tight into the backside they're trying everything to manufacture some offense right now Tom Herman told us when we set it countless times they've got nothing to lose you're in a four point ballgame and they will empty the kitchen sink here offensively and with the way their defense is playing if they could get six points to make it seven points they may be able to close the door on SC Ehlinger face backs picked up towel and it looked like a lenders but Chinna knew Oh sue he's the one that looks like he grabs the facemask but he never actually got the facemask it was just up around the neck that's a great call by the official I know Texas fans are going to be completely livid at that but he never did grab the facemask that's not a foul and then Ehlinger flips it out for the interception Dean your thoughts I agree with Joel he was underneath the mask he never grabbed the mast looked like a legal play anti look the teak with the reception in the first down a 14 yard game how many times has this defense answered the bell whether it's been turnovers from their offense or the short field or fourth down and they have to do it again now you have to wonder about how much energy is left in the tank for this Texas defense first down at the 34 now for USC petit goes in motion Jones straight ahead you'll pick up three and a half wheeler Nelson this defense has been unbelievable tonight in particular against the run us he has ran at 34 times for only 2.4 per carry Donald's been picked off twice and he's going to be leaned on right here trying to ice the game for USC second at six Donald over the middle incomplete deshaun Eliot almost had his third interception of the game and he read it beautifully I mean this is very close watch to Sean Elliott his eyes are all over the wide receiver and as soon as the ball comes out he breaks and that ball does hit the turf official was right on it but the recognition from Deshawn Elliott is off the charts right now he sees exactly what Sam Donald is trying to do and almost at his third third down six at the 38 Burnett the motion man dartle over the middle and it looks like a catch by Tyler Vaughn boy the coverage down the field was pretty good Donald had to escape the rush when you have to cover that long sometimes you can just lose for a second your grip of that wide receiver Chris Boyd was in coverage still a first down for USC 10yard game Donald off his back foot good net first down Trojans now is this Drive starts to wear on USC is up over that 70 play threshold I'm wondering how much gas is left in the tank for the pass rush you know they've been so good forcing dartle to be uncomfortable in that pocket we'll see if they can continue to do that here late in this ball game first down at the 42 car checks it and run it back 726 at County running right Milica Jefferson I love the vision watch him he's going to take a lane immediately I mean no hesitation and then when he gets there he gets there with authority Malik Jefferson he's playing one of the best games he's played as the Texas Longhorn second at 12 after the 2yard loss Sam Donald looking Donald under the minute Burnett gets the sidelines turns the corner gets out of bounds at the 22 22 yard gain for Deonte brunette this is just a player making a play right here Burnett's gonna be going here and then he's going to come all the way back across the field he's going to the flat and as soon as he sees his wife and his quarterback find time he gets to the middle of the field for a big completion Burnett six catches 85 yards and a score darn goal on Burnett and didn't complete he threw that one into double coverage Boyd and Jones were there Brandon Jones had an opportunity there for the interception off of the tip great play by Chris Boyd's you see that left hand right when he's trying to catch the ball the left hand goes up and through the hands pictureperfect technique from the defensive back to break up that pass second down and ten 6:20 to play the floor Donald looking dancing improvising and it'll chuck it out of bounds Donald has been seeing a lot of great coverage tonight down the field this Texas defense which doesn't generally play a lot of man coverage they play zone and they play it very well you see how all their eyes are in the backfield now this is the single receiver up top that's the guy that has to play man because there was three receivers to the top of the field only one down low so Chris Boyd is the only one that has to man up for Tom Harmon third down and 10 at the 22 for USC another false start just consider this consider this Joel if Texas doesn't give up that touchdown with five seconds remaining in the first half they're leading this game I mean that's got a credit USC for making that play Darnell dumped it off the Ronald Jones clay Helton took the proper timeouts in order to score that touchdown but I think that that just shows me how well their defense is playing because this Texas defense has been sensational tonight timeout USC USC faced with a third down at 15 of the 27 leading by four 612 remaining in the fourth quarter the fourth ranked team in the nation the USC Trojans in a dogfight with Texas in this long yardage situation that's number 44 Brecon Hager he's at the top of your screen as a rusher and remember true freshmen right tackle for USC and drew Voorhees is in the ball game third down 15 at the 27 and a whistle it's like some movement up front for the Trojans it's to elope and on full start left tackle this guy has 23 career starts and he's just gonna kick back first absolutely started and you saw where Texas was pressuring right right over that true freshman let's see if they do it again seven penalties 45 yards for SC third and 20 Darnell here comes a pressure goes down Anthony wheeler Jeffery McCulloch I love the cone from Todd Orlando first of all you're gonna work on the true freshman check this out they get an inside move and an outside move trying to confuse him by taking one player across his face and sending a defensive back they take the sack and that is a huge sack for Tom Herman and he knows it because that took SC way out of field goal range this defense man lights out on this defense has been fantastic you talk about backs against the wall constantly tonight bud ravitch will punt it away to hip he'll maps standing inside his own 10 again offense tell you what this this last series for USC has been some shenanigans hasn't it yes all the false starts now at delay game I get it that doesn't hurt you right there cuz you get five free yards to try to punt it down inside the ten but lots of mistakes for USC whatever SC was at one point at the Texas 22 yard line this would kick toward the far side fair caught inside the 10 5:14 to play Texas down by four couple of fist pumps going on with the coaches in the fourth quarter Texas down 14 to 10 with the football at their own nine yard line Sam Ehlinger the freshman from Austin years forming around the corner and Foreman will be tackle for bottle five maybe a six yard loss Cameron Smith first man to him a great play by Cameron Smith and he's going to have to be great on this series they've got three defensive front seven players that are out rasheem Green Porter Gustin and John Huston all starters all out with injuries second and 14 another false start well starts often convenient that's Kendall more the graduate transfer from Syracuse should be noted that Garret gray the starting tied in to begin the year has been banged up and they have lost him so Kendall more having to start six six to 50 forgets an early start there and this is not where you want to be with a true freshman late in the ball game second down at 16 at the three Gallagher Sprint's out back at the end zone over a cross caught and a first towel for you t little Jordan found a soft spot and he picks up 16 yards and it was almost intercepted watched this play from the safety position that's Chris Hawkins and he almost gets there but little Jordan is able to find the soft spot and Ehlinger finds him for the first down Texas with Sabri the rule they'll run at this time with Warren and he picks up five Cameron Smith with the tackle Smith is slow getting up a couple of USC Trojans slow getting up off the field as Smith is shaking that right hand he'll take a knee to be treated boy and that is gonna hurt because he is the heart and soul of that front seven he is intense he's physical he's had a great night he's great in recognition running down plays from side to side we saw it on the first play this year Oh Woody's it to pay you six tackles for Cameron Smith second and five at the 24 USC looks confused a Nagar with time and he gets rid of it unbound well the replacement for Cameron Smith has Levi Jones he's a true freshman from Texas and he's the one that forces selling her out of the pocket and runs him down third down and 5 325 to go Gus their only offense has been Colin Johnson this is the biggest snap in the game right here Johnson the receiver on the far side of the field number nine there he is five catches 123 yards us he's gonna have to burn a timeout timeout USC thirty seconds in length SC now out of timeouts let's take a look at the road ahead will start with Southern California yeah and in Southern Cal has a tough road ahead brought to you by Coors Light they do not have a buy because their buy actually falls on Thanksgiving so they'll place 12 straight games their next five at cow at Washington State which is a weeknight game on a Friday night Oregon State Utah here before traveling to South Bend and protects us they have a muchneeded break after this one they will get their bye week after this ballgame here in Los Angeles before they travel Ames they get Kansas State and then kind of a gauntlet backtoback with the two Oklahoma schools playing so well there in October 14 to 10 sellout crowd the first since 2013 at the Coliseum where the Trojans played Stanford a liger empty backfield he's got good wheels allen girl steps up breaks the tackle rolls whoops runs and it looks like a first down boy he was awful close to that sideline I thought he stepped out a couple yards short of the first down marker watch as he starts to tightrope the sideline and his left foot right there was close but then that heel tough to say but that ball sure did look like it got across the line to gain what an amazing effort they did say it was short and it did look like he kept his heel off that sideline so the offense remaining on the field fourth down and one I thought they would take a look at this because as he spun Gus he needed to get to the 29 and a half yard line that looks like it's off the coast they spotted the ball almost short of that 29 his feet clearly outofbounds prior to contact Dean Blandino yeah the keys gonna be where does the ball cross the sideline it didn't look like he stepped out prior to the 29 yard line but that ball is really close these are tough calls to overturn because you're trying to determine where the ball crossed the sidelines and you might have to piece a couple of angles together this is going to be close I think he got beyond the 29 but I don't know if you can put it beyond the line of game Dean will they adjust the spot based on that but maybe not give them the entirety of the first down yeah if you're sure that the spot is closer to the line the game you can move the football closer to the line the game and now they're gonna measure to see if he made it and then they'll bring the official change which are on the other side of the field far side of the field all the way over to see exactly how close this is that's exactly what they're doing you know at this point if you're Texas you've got to assume that you're not getting this you cannot be talking about a first down call you've got to be talking about a fourth down call if you're Tom Herman at this point I think your best option is to stay with Ehlinger and run some sort of a quarterback counter where he keeps the football because remember USC's defense is decimated with injuries you've got to get that first down I would run over the left side of the offensive line that's where your veterans are watch Patrick ba hey and Tristan Nicholson so here we go 311 to go Texas going for it on fourth down and one as Sam Bellinger and the Texas offense line up fourth and one Porter in the backfield Gallagher runs it and it looks like we will get that first down that's exactly what they did they tried to fool us see with that motion kind of a jet sweep action with Foreman running across the set but that was a design run for the quarterback the entire time and I'll tell you what that is some serious effort because he was contacted by Cameron Smith short of the line to gain and he was still able to get it Tim Beck is OC said Sam is tough hardnosed he could be a linebacker first out of ten at the 30 tell you what the miscommunication between Zack Shackleford and Sam Ehlinger is crazy Shackelford the center of sophomore 65 305 pounds he's on the Remington watch list is one of the better centers in the country but they cannot get on the same page as it relates to the snap count we've seen two snaps surprise Ehlinger tonight they lost one of those as a fumble bellanger had to throw the other away and they're Jack Burt just didn't even budge first at 15 Gallagher with time down the field and complete no flag intended for Lorenzo Joe Jack Jones was in coverage great coverage down the field now USC is a man team and Jack Jones says his eyes all over the football and just gets tangled up with the feet excellent no no call by the officials you see that ball was perfectly thrown but Lorenzo Joe was just unable to keep his feet second at 15 at the 25 Gallagher deep again sideline thirty Jackson Texas with 204 to go that's been the offense for Texas his binding Colin Johnson and why not six six to 20 working against Jack Jones there's only five eleven that's a mismatch right there folks and Johnson is able to go upstairs and bring it down his ability to catch that 5050 ball is pretty fantastic six catches 170 yards first and ten at the USC 28 down by four the true freshman making plays playaction Ellen Gert idiots incomplete they call it Johnson was open yeah he was telling her let go of that ball a little too soon and timing not quite there Johnson would have been open inside you see how he set up Jack Jones to the outside and then he made that inside move and he was open but Eleanor had already made the decision to throw it to the outside second at 10 from the 28 of us see Gallagher steps up in the pocket bottledup scrambles Thrones on the moon and incomplete little Jordan the intended receiver and that brings up third down in law you know against man coverage which USC is playing here you've got to get guys running across the field slant passes drag routes right now Texas is trying to throw everything vertically down the field think it's someone moving across the field they'll have some open space Colin Johnson the receiver at the bottom of your screen you would expect he'll ago to throw it tool third and ten here comes a blitz Ehlinger looks for Johnson and that would come in complete and that'll make it 4th down and 10 at the 28 you were going one spot and one spot only and that ball was just airmailed good timing Johnson ran a great route he was open but the ball was overthrown Texas calls a timeout they have one remaining pretend back the offensive coordinator of Texas and Tom Herman you have to expect that USC is going to pressure here you have a true freshman you've got banged up offensive lineman you've got a backup in Denzel Okafor at right tackle USC is most likely going to be in straight man coverage and send a pressure likely to the wide side of the field I expect them to try to isolate Colin Johnson and get him the ball quickly on a slant pass or even a quick fade you take a chance on a screen boy that's a that's a big chance because you're throwing the ball at that point about ten yards short of the line to gain and that's a lot to expect your back to get all ten of those yards if you're throwing it short of the line to gain you're going to want it be three or four yards short not ten so here we go for 50 10 to the 28 a minute 19 remaining Texas down by full sammelan girth Johnson's double covered trips at the top of your screen Allen girl droppin looking over the middle and come first down UT Armani Foreman the Longhorns still alive I tell you what Elling are wanted to go to Colin Johnson the double coverage though and he makes the great decision to come back and a great catch by Foreman Longhorns with one timeout after the 11 yard game from the USC 17 elegant in the end zone and he completely laryngeal Jo the intended receiver it's young much easier I imagine when you're doing it yourself I was gonna say he's probably more nervous now than he was back in the Rose Bowl of 2006 second and 10 at the USC 17 for Texas under a minute to go they have one timeout left Allen ger with time elegant flushed out throws touchdown Texas Wow the Frenchman Tiger is 45 seconds away Thom Hartmann six endo against ranked opponents as a head coach drew brees maybe what a play they're gonna review this but what a catch he secured the ball got two feet and then he maintained possession going to the ground that isn't alltime gutsy performance from Sam Ehlinger and this is only his second start first one on the road in front of 93,000 all right all right all right that's what I love about college football 45 seconds remaining in the fourth the Longhorns seconds away from a signature win against the 4th ranked team in the country on the road and then folks was our expectation shattering drop of the game sponsored by Buick he had all the time in the world but what I love is that Forman never stopped on the play down the field he was lined up all the way on the left side and he just kept running and running along with his quarterback and then made the catch along the sidelines Jack Jones was in coverage he tripped and fell and Tom Herman has he done it again we will see in 45 seconds however we saw what happened with five seconds to go in the first half let's see able to score yeah and that's exactly what's going through the minds of the Texas defenders Cameron Smith cannot believe it he was the one chasing Ehlinger out of the pocket that pass rush disappeared remember the pass rush before half it was just relentless sacking Elega or Elling on three straight snaps but it disappeared late roll it will kick it away Bayless Jones Stephen Carr back deep this will be valus Jones James with lanes Jones shot down at the 35 with 39 seconds to go John Bonney with the tackle and here comes Sam darling well we'll see what type of magic this kid has he had a little to end the first half no timeouts Gus so every throw is going to have to be beyond the first down marker or outside of the numbers the Texas defense has got to understand that first down at 10:00 at the 35 darn old over the middle and it's caught by Deonte brunette at midfield or close to it where do they need to go to get it field goal range at least the 33 yard line Darnell spikes the ball to stop the clock no timeouts for SC 30 seconds to go Texas has got to maintain their aggressive nature here if they sit back and try to play prevent like they did in the second half they'll give up way too many yards and also understand where Ronald Jones is on the field second down and ten at Texas called to timeout both teams out of timeouts now and remember SC's kicker missed his only attempt in this game a 46yard er did not attempt a field goal in the first two games chase McGrath he's a walkon saman kicked kicking in practice the limits of his range is around 48 yards second down at 10 of the 48 30 seconds to play dardo it trouble garbage check back down to 30 21yard gay and se spikes it they're in range for a field goal in range but it's still the limits Gus they've got 22 seconds no timeouts Darnell can not throw the ball short of the first down inside the numbers he does that and it's likely to end the game unless they can get a spike quickly second at 10 at the 31 22 seconds to go Donald looking over the middle Nixon with the catch and he's down at the 10 Steven Mitchell with a 21yard pickup 14 seconds you have at least one maybe two shots at the end zone before they come out and try to attempt the gametying field goal no timeouts for USC the drive started at the 35 first and 10 Darnell fire and incomplete Dion tapered net eight seconds to go great pressure from that Texas defense it started with their middle linebacker Malik Jefferson he was working on the true freshman running back Stephen Carr he's the one that forced Arnold out of the pocket watch car tried to block Jefferson just a total mismatch and Arnold had to get rid of it as Charles omena who was in on the pressure second down and 10 of the 13 eight seconds to play no timeouts for SC Darnell Sprint's up whoops and incomplete with two seconds to go and here comes a field goal unit chase McGrath was 13 for 18 in his final two years at Mater Dei he's from Newport Beach California walkon freshman this one from 31 yards away 17 what kitc ice water running through your veins right there young man and he had to hit the laces what a drive from dartle to scoring drives now late first half they get a touchdown clay Helton sees his team drive the length of the field picking the gametying fill go on Sam darn 'old was magnificent because he understood the situation he knew when he had to kill the clock he knew when he had to burn the ball out of bounds to stop the clock that was it just a beautifully orchestrated Drive from number 14 and back in 2006 when these two teams met in the national championship game at the Rose Bowl it was magical the rematch for the first time in 12 seasons magical each team will get a chance to score first and ten from the 25 yard line as you take a look at the overtime winner the coin toss elects which end of the field we play on but your call captain to the call is tails back up a little bit and it is tails Texas is won the toss be their ball first down I'm sorry all right coming up overtime from Los Angeles 1717 welcome back to the LA Coliseum our game is tied at 17 overtime is brought to you by tire rack fine deliver install smarter directors of over time and this is how we got here it's been a sensational game really dominated by the defenses this was late in the first half that was a pick six but he came right back USC with five seconds left in that first half Ronald Jones took kind of a Hail Mary in there and Sam Ellington let his team down the field took the lead under a minute Sam Donald came right back getting the gametime field goal and we find ourselves in extra time what's the strategy Joel quickly at over 1000 more time tends to be more about the passing game because the field is condensed and it's harder to run the ball neither of these teams has run the ball very effectively anyways this game is boiling down to kind of a Sam Darnell Deonte Burnett versus Sam Ehlinger Colin Johnson style game a steel start from the 25 D'Arnot in the shotgun fires partner birthday eight catches 123 to school you got a credit t Martin because he's going to send a post route right across the face of the safety and then you sneak in behind him with a second post route which is Burnett and he's able to catch the touchdown that was Tyler Vaughn's number 21 he got the attention of the defense and it allows Burnett to get separation and a little DAP from the Hall of Famer mat liner McGrath comes into a tip the extra point and it's good SC scores on the first play of overtime Deonte Burton net to take a 24 to 17 lead now it's Texas's turn over time was always going to favor USC because they're the deeper team they've got the more experienced offensive players but Tom Herman and his team they have shown some serious guts and some fight every time that they have been in a tough situation or behind the eight ball they have come out swinging I expect them to do that here on this Drive remember they have not been able to run the ball very effectively at all their best offense has been number nine Colin Johnson for Sam Ehlinger outside of the pocket creating plays first down for Texas at the 25 hands it off here is the reverse hip hill Matt's looking goes nowhere Cameron Smith back in the game Christian rector joining us we've seen a couple of reverses for Texas tonight and they have been successful but it is so difficult to go back to that well because once the defense sees it a couple of times they understand the movement and they can react accordingly as a good stop there for USC second and ten hello girl spinning through nobody there and this baby a penalty against UT and it will be your best players have to force the issue and I'll Chinna nuo su forced Tristan Nicholson into a hold with a great pass rush there's no Oso and he's going to get upfield but then he's gonna dart inside and that inside move right there is what forces Nicholson to grab his jersey and bring him down to the ground had to hold him there Elinor had no chance but now this is a tough situation second at 20 they've got a double cover Colin Johnson he's the wide receiver to the top of your screen Gallagher looking for Johnson over the meadow first down Johnson ran a great route caught that in heavy traffic come on marshal brings him down I have no idea why they didn't double cover him had to USC players playing nobody down low and the intermediate zones and Johnson was working deep great throw by Ehlinger great catch by Johnson for the first down Johnson seven catches 191 yards first down Gallagher looking over the middle caught Lorenzo Joel lost his footing if not he could have jogged in the endzone oh my goodness he slipped and fell down he had the touchdown he's going to walk in and he just loses the left foot goes down to the ground but he does get a first down so pay first and goal here coming up Gus at the three yard line Chris Warren in the backfield hip Hill maps in motion Ehlinger Sprint's up looks backside throws wide open touchdown Longhorns what an answer from Texas and San bellanger here's Kate Brewer here and they're gonna fake the block and then he's going to head all the way across the field the eyes of the defense follow Ehlinger he gets all the way outside the hash mark and then throws to a wide open Brewer back on the other side and Kate Brewer the true freshman with the biggest catch of his life Joshua will roll in for the extra point and the top and it's good 24 24 SC in Texas in overtime here in LA second overtime coming up let's go back to throw beach work under pressure duplicate one that's how we started the day highlighting what happened back in 2006 of the National Championship game which turned out to be one of the greatest games in the history of college football this one turning out to be a classic as well allenburg 3 4 3 4 35 yards of the touchdown in the first overtime Gallagher bottled up and sacked Christian rector fifth sack of the day for the Trojans great inside move from rector beating that back up tackle Denzel Okafor trying to create some pressure on that Longhorn quarterback they were in this exact situation in the first overtime second and long who they go they went right to their playmaker Colin Johnson second at 18 Gallagher underneath hip hill max if this true freshman quarterback a lot of credit because now he's recognizing coverage very well he saw the double coverage over Colin Johnson so immediately he gets the ball to a wide receiver and allows him to run after the catch and creates a more manageable situation here for third down after the 11 yard gain third and seven Valon girl throws on the moon caught first down UT at the 10yard line Chris Warren I knew we were coming to see a great game I knew that we were coming to see a quarterback that could create outside of the pocket make plays down the field I just didn't know that that quarterback was going to be Sam Ehlinger this kid has had quite performance tonight I mean just a sensational second half he has been very gritty and tough running four first downs and making great decisions here in crunch time first down at the 11 gallagher runs it with space lowers his shoulder that gets inside the SC five great push from the offensive line howling her wasn't touched until he was about five yards down the field boy he's taking some punishment tonight eight yard gain second at two at the three and FC was it the Trojans first the turnover Christian rector was the USC player he's going to come in from the left side here big number 89 and he's the one that rips the ball out warren couldn't jump on it and USC gets a huge tournament four turnovers for Texas today boy just sick to your stomach force a Mellinger in that offense they played so well to get to this point but rector makes the play and now for USC on offense you've got to be a bit more conservative because you just need a field goal they are still looking at this imagine they're looking at his forward progress to try to establish if it was done or that was pretty quick I think this is gonna stand certainly and it will thus those are things that just don't happen in high school there's not players of that size and strength level that can rip the ball out of your hands and as a true freshman there's no way to recreate that in practice so SC can win it with a field goal Sam Darnell has the manager Jones and Jones gain a half yard is Philippe Jefferson comes up with it with another hard hit this guy's vision is just out of this world watch how far he goes to his left immediately finds the gap in bank again behind the line of scrimmage Malik Jefferson has been absolutely brilliant tonight from his middle linebacker spot no games second and 10 Stephen Carr the game now remember he's dangerous out of the backfield catching the ball darling looking d'Arnaud they call it a complete bonds is going to the ground does he have control the ball clearly hits the ground he doesn't have control there that is an incomplete pass and an excellent call by the official the buff can touch the ground as long as you have complete control but the left hand slipped off the ball while it was on the grill incomplete if you would have had burned possession gusts with both hands and it touches the ground that's a completion but when the left hand came off he loses control at that point when the ball hits the ground it's an incompletion the officials were all over it and made the correct call third down and ten from this point it'd be a 42yard field goal yeah and that's that is not a comfortable attempt for chase McGrath Darnell avoids the RUS incomplete and now fourth down what an effort by this defense what an effort by this defense Jefferson akin was in the back field forcing darn 'old to step off of his spot throw it before he wanted to and now McGrath for the chance to win it he missed a 46 yarder earlier he sent the game into overtime tying at it 17 with the 31 yard make they officially say this is from 43 yards away but revenge's the holder and a timeout called by the Longhorns the field goal that they attempted earlier in the game was of similar distance and from the same hash mark that look can get into the head of your kicker they hoped that we hooked that one far left excuse me I was wrong I thought this was the make earlier to tie the game from the left left hash mark you see he's got that natural jar this was the Miss and the draw misses to the left now he's on the right hash mark with that natural draw freshman walkon chase McGrath from 43 yards away cleats that get all doggy 27 to 24 the finally another classic between these two legendary programs it down on the field our Jenny Taft is with coach help guys Thank You coach do legendary teams we knew that there would be hype I don't know of anyone who could have predicted this what did you make of tonight yeah credit credit to Texas what a class act program came out here and fought and credit toward kids for making plays down the stretch that's what great teams do if you're trying to win championships you're going to be in one of these games and you're gonna have to execute at the end and they did you told us before tonight special teams had to step up Jace McGrath your walkon freshman just won this thing for you guys what can you say about that performance he's getting ready to get the biggest hug for me he's ever had in his life but what he what a valiant effort from a freshman to do his job and help his Trojan family we forget Sam's Arnold only as 13 start tonight his teammates describe him as having a calmness what did you see from his boys tonight well with 45 seconds left and no timeouts and having to go the distance you always have hope with Sam Donovan and he proved it once again how great he is when the lights are the brightest we make this one a tradition enjoy coach Thank You Gus all right thank you very much our progressive performance of the game goes to the freshman walkon place kicker chase McGrath the game was on his foot twice and he came through both times first and regulation to tie this thing and take it to overtime there's not a fork pressure kick that he'll ever hit in his life and then there to win it in a tie ballgame and double overtime and he retains the perfect season for us see what a game partner what a game the first field goals of his career Wow the final score here at the Los Angeles Coliseum USC defeats Texas in overtime 27 to 24 Rob stone of the guys we'll be back with more postgame coverage from the Coliseum after these messages there's a reason you have kickers on your roster true freshman walkon kickers from where mat liner a modern a high school baby that's how we do it a 31 yarder is time to expire to force overtime at 17s and then the kid drills one from 43 to give number for USC a 27 24 victory Rob stone Robert Smith Matt Leinart the coach Dave wants out here with you Sam Darnell kind enough to join us live on the set and let's let the two Trojan cubies talk first Sam it's it's the last Drive of the game Texas comes down and scores about 40 seconds left and you have no timeouts take us through that tie that game tying drive there in the end of the game yeah I mean we've done it multiple times in practice we practice it every Friday twominute drive so I guess we just went out there and do it then exactly like we did in practice but you know stakes were a little higher but just continuing to execute couldn't give enough credit to all right guys the way they prepared all week and they're ready for for a battle and that's what we got out of Texas out of a great Texas program you know I've heard so much about how calm your demeanor is and you know I I see you sitting here right now and it seems like you haven't played a game smile there's nothin and I want to point out after the game everybody's chasing after the kicker you're going and shaking hands with the Texas players what's going through your mind right now do you feel relief or you just saying hey just another step along the path no that wasn't just another step you know that was a great Texas team and again credit goes out to them they prepared obviously really well and they gave us fits in the first half in the second half but yeah I mean just like I said continuing to do what we do in practice I like to try to keep my boys just so when I make a throw like I did to get to Deonte over here I don't gun it and you know overthrow him or anything but it was just such a great game it was awesome to be a part of hey Sam let me ask you you know last week was such a big win versus Stanford the prepper it was at the preparation it was a good this week or did Texas do something different tonight did they change up the Front's that they blitz more or less hey what why I mean you know cuz you struggled a little bit as a team on offense Charlie right I mean that's that's just the thing is we knew they're gonna bring a lot a lot of different pressures a lot of different looks but and they did mix it up like we knew they're going to so I think that was the biggest thing great defensive coordinator of Texas he knows what he's doing for sure but it was it was an awesome battle and it was it was cool to see our defense step up the way they did and you know with these games they're just gonna continue to learn from them and you can't really do anything else on that so say with you guys forced overtime what was the message to the offense first play you had an immediate strike to take the lead but what a clay Helton say to you guys is you organize yourself for overtime just to continue to play he knows that we prepare really hard to play in overtime and we take all those reps so we knew the shots when they were going to come and that we had to take advantage of them and we did that and I'm so happy that Deonte came down with it you know who we found it you at the back of the end zone here watch those two go to I had to be cool right there that's awesome so just the the resilience of this team Sam just just what's it going to be like in this locker room now obviously got pac12 play your kicker all these things are you excited to go get some hugs to your teammates okay yeah I'm excited to go celebrate with them to be honest I haven't yet I went straight to the Texas team and gave props like like I knew that you know they deserved so I'm excited to go celebrate with them and have a great time Sam go celebrate you guys have very little time to bounce back no buy weeks for you guys through the course to the regular season congratulations go enjoy a wonderful performance again kind of a hohum game until the final three minutes of each half and overtime that's where we saw all the scoring outside of one field goal double overtime win for number for USC the Longhorns thought they had at Sam Donald and company driving the field getting the field goal to force overtime and then double overtime a fumble and then a money field goal from a freshman walk on USC wins it 27:24 you",

  "transcript": "the commanderinchief's trophy is on the line today at West Point the Falcons want the trophy back at Air Force Army is trying to repeat for the first time in their school history bragging rights for the whole year are on the line who will sing second you sing second that means you won the game and these great service academy robberies today we've got a beauty for you from the banks of the Hudson River for the commanderinchief's trophy Air Force with a win they claim it army gets a win they would retain it a big day and we started here from Mikey Stadium a pleasure and an honor to be with you alongside my broadcast partner jay Feely my name is ben holden happy november and this game Jay means so much to both of these teams last year army it was step one when they beat Air Force out in Colorado Springs 21 nothing that eventually led them to the commanderinchief's trophy Air Force wants it back they haven't had it in two years what do you see today everything that's right about college football the passion the pageantry is on display today these two teams desperately want to beat each other in great football you look at army the last four weeks four big wins over big teams after narrowly losing to Oklahoma and overtime but none of that matters if you lose to your bitter rival Air Force yeah and the last team to beat army here Air Force two years ago they've won 10 in a row since then we'll see what happens today of course a Mont Rancho is the guy last year leading the offense for Army now it's Kelvin Hopkins in his show Calvin Hopkins is the best passer throwing the ball the Jeff Monken has ever had in this offense he adds the added element of being able to go up top and stretch defenses vertically when you stack the Box you put 10 men in the box against their ovens Brent Davis can dial up the playaction and can go to the air it creates a lot of problems for defenses he had a hundred passing and a hundred rushing last week in that win over Eastern Michigan now we talked about Troy Calhoun and his team who's going to play quarterback two years ago here Arion Worthman started his first ever game in that win I mentioned earlier but now they've got three guys and nobody knows until this game who's gonna play worth myth started this season then they benched him they went to Hammond he got injured so they go to Sanders he had a good game last week 200 through the air hundred on the ground against Boise State we think it'll be Sanders but if he struggles do you go back to Worthman because he's had success against this army defense he's had very good success against it no question about a Troy Calhoun nine and two alltime against the army the last one the commanderinchief's trophy here in 2016 with a 31:12 win over Jeff Monken steam and last year was monk ins first win in this series against Air Force he wants another one they don't want to give that trophy back he said hey we win today we retain it they get it it's going in a box back to Colorado Springs in their truck that's how it works out Army's full backs always a key whenever they play and for more on that the third member of our team Tina servo CEO well Ben at West Point and every week army puts five full backs on their depth chart and every game all five playing contribute in this triple option offense I want to point out to to you to watch today we're going to start with Darnell Wolfe oh he has a team captain and the rushing leader he has been dealing with a sore hamstring and despite being limited in practices he still comes out every game pounding at the position an offensive coordinator Brett Davis calls him quote a hammer head as he hammers away at opposing defensive fronts now expect to see more of Kaylin Holt today he was dealing with a knee injury in previous weeks but he's healthy now and we'll play more at slotback home place fast and it's because of his athleticism and that she is Army's lead blocker and can play multiple positions Ben yes Tina thank you so much they've told us for a couple of years he is their best allaround football player it is jampacked the sellout here at Mikey Stadium the weather right now is great a postcard like day 54 degrees partly sunny but the wind Jay could be a factor as this game goes along it certainly could air for throw the ball more than they have in the past average in 137 sodas army army G average our average in 91 yards a game through the air so as this wind continues to blow and you get gust upwards of 50 miles an hour it could impact a play calling we'll keep our eyes on that great to have you with us wherever you're watching today these two great service academies under way is the 53rd installment of Army and Air Force is underway Cal Walker with a fair catch in the end zone it'll be a first down in 10th from the 25 for Army Tom now J for our chickfila starting lineups and we touched on Calvin Hopkins a little bit there in the open but I know you have a lot more you seen out of him that you like this year than we've talked about he missed the Miami game that we did cam Thomas played and played well only ran the ball last week against Eastern seven for 800 26 yards two touchdowns through the air and that's something last year they had 20 completions army did all of last year so he adds something that's so different that now makes this triple option offense so much harder to defend yeah an army didn't attempt to pass last year in five possessions against Air Force and Wolffe folks got at left side plowing ahead and Darnell Woolfolk with a pickup of about seven and a half let's look at the rest of the chickfila starters Jay who you highlighting today well you'll see the fullback a lot but watch for Kel Walker coming out of the backfield they have two touchdowns last year against air force leads the team in receptions very dangerous with the ball on the edges and then through the year he also had a touchdown in 2016 was three for 38 so he's had success against this team in the last couple years they give him seven on the first time run make that eight and once again Darnell Wolfville doing what he does gets the first down to the 37 yard line ere for starters brought to us by chickfila toes you got it AJ well they've got a new defensive coordinator at kind of a simplistic defense Jordan Jackson their defense alignment is the most talented defender on this team he had seven tackles against Navy and the triple option attack earlier this season expect to see him play a big game game today and try and slow down this offense and you can see right away Brent Davis saying I'm coming right at you you know I want to run the fullback I'm gonna run his straight ahead two times in a row first out that's a message sent by Brent Davis Wolfe all checks out that's holt in motion Hopkins has it right side Calvin Hopkins spins away there's a flag down came in from the back of the play he took the ball out across the 42 but we'll have to check the marker and our referee who will hear from momentarily for the first time today is Mike de f\u00e9e rice Holland in there listening in Holland quoted earlier this week saying the CIC it belongs here senior leader at center for Jeff Monken squad any idea here Jeff they're talking a lot I think it's going to be an army coming back here there is no foul employee second all right there you go where they threw it looked like they're looking at that offensive line Army's done a good job lately of not getting those low block penalties the cup blocks they had a lot at the beginning of the year with the new rule they've adjusted better where Brent Davis's don't have his offensive lineman hit above the waist and then slide down when they're doing the cut blocks Bennett's legal yeah they had to learn really had to learn how to to block all over again they keep it right up the middle and it's Connor swamped go once again to the 45 yard line it'll bring up third and a couple Tina talked about fullbacks at the beginning open to give you some perspective this year Army's full backs have eleven hundred and forty six yards through on the ground 16 touchdowns the leading rusher in college football Jonathan Taylor Wisconsin 1155 yards the leading rusher on the ground Devon Singletary 15 rushing touchdowns so they're as good as the best backs in the country the full backs are for army production line no question third and two here and army best percentage on fork down if they don't get it it likely go for it here if they don't pick it up fault Darnell wall fault and to the pile and he's got the first down to the 48 yard line Capra made the tackle on him got some help from Jeremy fennel um and Jay man look at you feel you clean up good awesome wait there we go lemon tram your extra points for air force they have to be better on third and fourth down than army armies the best in the country cumulative ly on those two downs and then defensively Air Force has got to get the ball to Hopkins hands he's the engine that runs it for army don't turn the ball over Jeff Monken steams 12 in over the last three years with zero turnovers and defensively stop the fullback Fagan is the best fullback Air Force has had in a while they have to be able to stop him now but Hopkins gives off another fullback Andy Davidson with a big run Davidson to the 39 of air force move those sticks again first down army Andy David Davidson does such a good job of seeing where the lane is being able to adjust more folk is the straight ahead bold that just pulls his way by sheer will 80 Davidson does a great job of picking his way and I love when he does well because in 2016 he had 961 yards 12 touchdowns for this team and he's had to kind of sit behind Woolfolk as wolf hook has become the roar course back yeah indeed and Jeff Monken said yesterday he's been very impressed with his attitude that's JB hunter the right tackle who's down on the field as they tend to him he's the best athlete on that offensive line has come a long way from where he was as a freshman and be a big loss if they lose JD hunter certainly would they've had Peyton reader they weren't sure about they had Jax sides the right guard ready to go if reader who's the normal starting right guard was unable to go was able to get in the lineup today and start the game as they continue to tend to JB hunter the sophomore out of Oceanside California they're gonna have to help him off the field favoring that left leg 12 all one to go in this opening quarter no score 53rd meeting between these two just a perfect day here with a Sun out and the two teams huddle up the Corps of Cadets saw 4400 porn in a lot of airforce folks here as well Stadium continuing to fill up a sellout crowd here at Mikey Stadium it's been a tough year so far for Troy Calhoun his Air Force squad they're only three and five they did beat Navy though if they can get a win against Army and Navy it salvages that season for this program no question Air Force win today they win the CIC back army wins they retain it can win it outright if they can beat Navy in December left side run there and late flag there Capra involved in the plays a guy that Troy Calhoun talked with us about yesterday said he's one of our top leaders on the defensive side of the ball the senior out of Argyle Texas two tackles last week against Boise State had a seasonhigh four tackles in that win you mentioned the 35 seven went over Navy personal foul chop block number 73 in number 76 it's the second level 15yard penalty replay first down so that's deep and reader something you just referenced earlier and we haven't seen a lot the last few weeks but we did see a lot of that early in the year well that's your two guards your left guard and your right guard coming right up in the middle of your screen and you see this is not the new rule this is the old rule because reader goes high and then deep Deaton comes down low you can't highlow that's a penalty that's been a penalty for a while so backs army up and now they're in a poor position they are its first and 23 for the Black Knights they're back on their side of the field from the 48 therefore showing pressure Hopkins going to put it up for the first time completes it and it's caught by Jordan Asbury who had a big week last week out of rushing touchdown and a touchdown receiving at Eastern Michigan watch the way the Hopkins throws his ball and delivers he looks like a legitimate quarterback in college football when we when we did the game last year out in Colorado Springs army couldn't throw the ball they didn't trust him on Bradshaw they trusted his legs he had 265 your heart in a cabinet record for a quarterback yeah but they didn't trust him throwing it because you can draw back and throw the ball that allows you to be so creative and do so many things you're so effective running the ball 4.7 Perosh that defenses have to stack the line second down and 11 now Hopkins wall fault puts his head into it Tina mentioned they do call him the hammer head it's in there and gets a couple so it's gonna bring up third and relatively long not the position that army wants to be in known they're not in field goal range here so expect if they get half the yardage that Brent Davis will go for it we may sit we might not see a punt all game yeah both these teams air force leaves the country going for 30 times on fourth Don Army's right behind them 29 army at 90% on fourth down is best in the country it is best in the country there were four for four last week if we get to that at Eastern Michigan inside of ten to play in the opening quarter opening possession of the game Hopkins looked like he was going to throw it out takes up he's got well but he's got the first down and he's dropped at the 25yard line pendulum came up and made the tackle but army marches there's a flag down though to gain of 13 if it stands late flag they just run a quarterback draw here great call by Brent Davis comes back and then releases watch the end of this run i think if hopkins stays outside here he may score right there there was an angle the results of the play is a first down after the play personal foul unnecessary roughness offense number 65 15yard penalty we'll be first in team Bryce Holland their leader talked about him a few moments ago take any unnecessary roughness penalty J that's their captain he started 35 consecutive games can't have plays like this right in the middle you saw it right there in the middle of your screen he comes up and lays into him you had a great run by your quarterback you have a first down you're cruising and now you back yourself up sometimes in these rivalry games laws you can be way too revved up now listen over me does not want this team to win airforce desperately doesn't want army to win you got to control your motion here's Davidson good job and a great push up front by Air Force and you and I both watch back that Navy game and that is exactly what Air Force did against Navy their defensive front was great the D line for Air Force dominated that game they did not allow Navy to run their offense they had a struggle through there on the ground and really just dominated that game from start to finish good play made up front by Jordan Jackson that sophomore you talked about earlier j65 and 270 he is Kyle Johnson their big part of their defense in jr. number forty third on their team and tackles second and tackles for loss second down and eight now for Army this is the 11th play of the drive Hopkins hit spins took a heavy shot from feds'll him there who came in and finished him off that's fetch alum six tackle on this open everywhere he has he's been all over the field for this team came into the game with 77 tacked up so he's got 83 already on the season he had 13 last week they brought him off the edge a lot against Navy in that Navy game is very successful creating havoc in that backfield yeah he had nine tackles and his first career sack in that game has it brother Clayton it's a safety for the Cincinnati Bengals third and five now for Army they need the 30 full commotion man Hopkins trying to get it himself and dies Kelvin Hopkins shades of Ahmad Bradshaw early on and another first down are we dug themselves out of a hole you called that's exactly what I thought when I watch this his ability to pick through that didn't look like there was any room there he kind of slithered through picked his way and found a way to get the first down and that is exactly what a mob Bradshaw did so well that's the split zone follow they call it right yeah last year we hadn't seen that coming into that air force game and then they continued to run it and run it and Air Force really had no answer you figure these teams know each other so well that as you come into this game you're gonna have something that you saved in your back pocket because you you have to have some kind of wrinkle that these deep coordinators don't know haven't prepared for because you know exactly what I'm gonna do it I know exactly stop gonna do fry and you're gonna yeah you gotta try to stop it you know what's coming nearly mirror images in terms of offense is not exactly the same but pretty close no Air Force a little bit more in shotgun they're running the same triple option offense had some interesting conversations with Jeff Monken about where that originated Fisher to bury Paul Johnson who broke the wishbone FERS yeah of course there's a discrepancy between Army and Air Force Ross Connors you saw him number 31 go off for Air Force they check on him and this is Cal Walker and airforce does a good job stringing him out on the nearside not much doing therefore Kel Walker who's a home run waiting to happen Air Force they they're home run guy waiting to happen Ronald Cleveland unable to play today big loss for Air Force not having Ronald Cleveland on the ground and then in the air he's the one guy you could throw the ball to yeah he could break a tackle and take it the distance not having him in the game he got injured that's a big loss for that team second down and eight halfway through this opening quarter no score in the game Holt in motion Darnell wall full right side diving his way to the 20 yard line it'll bring up third and short and the time a possession army leads the country this year at 40 minutes and 2 seconds but how about since 96 look at that list it's impressive and what they did against Oklahoma yeah it's unbelievable one of the best teams in the country all they did is hold it for 44 minutes and keep Kyler Murray on the sidelines yup they held it last week for 45 minutes and 12 seconds against Eastern Michigan so another third down here army 15th play of the drive wolf fought bangs his way forward and should have it based on the spot ladies got it how did yeah by a couple inches the other moving the sticks up and he got it he needed to get just before the 17 yard line and he got there and then some this army offense really kind of came into its own last year when they found the ability and developed the ability to run the ball effectively to not turn it over to not have negative plays that's really what held them back and I talk about it all the time in 2015 there's 38 fullness 2016 31 last year only 7 fumbles this year only six fumbles the entire year they have six first downs on this Drive Jay they've got another fresh set of downs Davidson decent pick up for Davidson inside of the 15 to about the 13 yard line and helping out on a stop again was Micah Capra number 90 upfront gain of four Armed Forces football proudly supported by bass pro shops and Cabela's we're not the five minutes left in this quarter yeah it might be one quarter each you get a possession in a quarter second quarter air force kids a possession drive over ten minutes long and Counting at this point well this is what the game was last year out in Colorado spring was over in like two hours and 20 minutes it was unbelievable second and six Walker goes in motion Hopkins has it Hopkins can't get outside good job again by that airforce front back now coming in to help finish him off they're a linebacker spot grant feel did a good job good contained by him third down coming up they did a good job setting the edge outside not allowing Hopkins really to get out there free and then watch 49 back no coming right there and cleaning up he's played better this year he's really one of those guys truly dedicated to the team a team player in every sense of the word does whatever you need him to do played really big against Navy had 13 tackles in that game he did darnell woeful behind hopkins 17th play of the drive wolf full bags into the linebacker straight ahead and it's gonna bring up fourth down and short so no question about it they're going for it there's not even a clock can already see them running on up this is who they become this is what the analytics told them they made a commitment to the analytics last year and it paid huge dividends for Army because they mesh both their scheme as well to analytics approach and they're always committed to it it's paid off huge I said it earlier 26 of 29 on fourth down this year 90% best in the country it is indeed fourth and a yard Hopkins woeful Darnell Wolfe folks got the first down got enough Hopkins trip coming I think it's what got stepped on mate I sent her a guard was able to kind of keep his balance and get the handoff watch Hopkins come out of here just kind of trip right there that stepped on but he does a good job and will the ball the hammer just coming in there and bullying his way to a first down so Darnell Wolfe focus came into the game 40 yards away from becoming the 13th player in Academy history to reach 2,000 yards and he's been a major part of this Drive although he's going to come out right now for a play he's got eight rushes for 31 yards on this Drive already have you ever seen a drive take up the entire first quarter no I have at three minutes left in the first quarter not even all the years we've done football here at army Sandin McCoy he's the fullback Hopkins has at Hopkins trying to find a seed flag down and Hopkins takes it down to the 1 but there is a flag down back in the vicinity of the 5 yard line so we'll have to check the penalty this is going to be the third penalty on this offensive line on this Drive alone Mike Duffy getting the particulars from his crew and he'll give us the word here momentarily personal cloud chop that's on Peyton reader and Bryce Holland this time that's what the first penalty was the first time it was on Deaton and reader yes so this time again highlow combination can't go high and then chop Mach low watch right here in the middle of your screen you're watching those two guys low he makes contact high it's kind of ticky tacky but that's the rule this cannot make contact high and have somebody else cut low so now its first and goal all the way back out the 22 yard line Hopkins looking to throw a pressure coming that tried to come up with a spectacular catch but couldn't do it Jay it's a good throw about Hopkins it's not dangerous is where only your receiver can catch it he got hit as he threw and watched his effort by Asbury boy that was really close to his elbow being down in bounds let's take a look here there's the ball there's the elbow does that ball rule I think he's got it there I think they're going to take a look at this I think they're going to so they'll send this upstairs to joe ryder our replay official steve Frederick's in the communicator will get on the headset with referee Mike Duffy based on that look ji I'm with you on that it looked like that elbow was down he's got to have contact before he touches outofbounds that's the question there has to be indisputable evidence to overturn it because they called it incomplete here he comes there's the catch there's the elbow I believe the elbow is inbound so the question becomes are they certain that he had and did he finish the catch as well this is a really good angle of it yeah it's a great angle bakru there's the elbow and there's the fall now you can see the ball as we've rolled back there again the ball definitely makes contact with the gun I don't think they're gonna overturn this it's an excellent effort by Jordan has very big time here's a catch ball what a great look this is they called it incomplete on the field now it's in the hands of our replay official here today Joe Ryder sellout crowd here at Mikey Stadium 53rd alltime meeting between these two academies first leg in the commanderinchief trophy race for Army Air Force already beat Navy they can win it today if they win army would retain it and have a chance to win it outright they were to beat Navy in December in Philly they're talking about a lot of things they're writing stuff down that to me tells you they're gonna overturn this yeah you got to get the time right the yardage right it's just an unbelievable effort by both Calvin Hopkins to get that ball out there and then Jordan as play that lay out and to secure this ball and to try to keep security that ball through the catch after reviewing the play the runner had his knee in bounds with firm control which apparently taken down a gamechanging play that could very well be throughout the course of this one huge they were packed up they had goal to go now you get it all the way down inside the two yard line whose goal to go at the 22 so Jordan Asbury continues his hot play here the last couple of weeks second and goal Hopkins and the offense come back on Woolfolk it'll be lined up behind him 21 yard pass play to Jordan Asbury Woolfolk gets it takes it it touchdown RB strikes first here against air force as they march down the field a drive that took nearly 30 minutes I've never seen anything like 12 believe it will be 521 plays 75 yards in 12:55 Woolfolk was slow to get up there he's been dealing with a hamstring yet didn't practice some money that's his 32nd touchdown of his career yes they have depth at as Tina talked about five full backs that's what's allowed them to be so good at the fullback position because they have depth they can bring other guys in and keep their guys fresh if they did lose wolf folk that would be huge for drive of 10 or more minutes this season only six in the entire FBS Wolff Faulk with his fifth straight game with rushing touchdown Honest John Abercrombie comes on and tacks on the point after in jrv leads it seven up they fast ferry laying his body on the line to beat Air Force and Woolfolk won't be denied putting it in the end zone put an army up college football on CBS Sports Network is sponsored by USAA insurance banking and investments tailored for the military community by Golden Corral your choice rules and by bass pro shops and Cabela's your adventure starts here look back through history and the straight rivalry Air Force leads in all time they've won 18 of the last 21 against army but last season Jeff Mullins guys a 21 nothing shutout in Colorado Springs and we've got many servicemen and women here of course and over in Afghanistan the first Stryker Brigade Combat Team we salute you the fourth entrance fee provision that's the helmet sticker the army players are wearing today thanks for your service men and women over there and all around the globe what a day what a start j21 place 75 yards 12:55 capped by a Darnell Woolfolk one yard touchdown run and we're down to two off five to go in the opening quarter it's 12:30 they're kicking it into the win here I'd be ready to return this they're gone up from the 8th that is saucier with it saucier dropped at the 25yard line so with 157 remaining in the opening quarter will step aside will see Air Force's offense when we come back always like a postcard here Mikey Stadium just an absolutely beautiful day and we got an opportunity Joyner tops crew bright and early tomorrow morning at 8:00 Eastern is they'll get you ready for the jampacked dandy NFL don't miss the unmatched analysis and bold predictions from our football experts on that other pregame show right here on CBS Sports Network presented by Kubota J time to get a look now at Air Force with a minute 57 remaining the opening quarter in their offense so the answer has been revealed the junior the hometown product Isiah Sanders out of Colorado Springs starts the game he had a good game last week even though they lost against Boise State at 210 10 yards passing 97 on the ground and a touchdown needs to be careful with the ball has to protect the ball and make their decisions against this aggressive defense pitch it out to the outside of the nearside and the Falcons and a good pick up there from Kaden Remsburg the soft rod of Newton Kansas the rest of their offense brought to a spot chickfila who you go with their fullback Cole Fagan a key to their offense especially today Jay Bateman as defense pitched a shutout last year in Colorado Springs fullback production opens up the rest of this offense who Fagan is better than anybody they had in a number of years at that position father played for the San Francisco 49ers defensive end was a good one it's made by Joseph saucier first onair force he's a big play waiting to happen 27 yards a reception excellent place to start this drive for air force last four games saucier averaging 17 point nine yards a touch that was Fagan who you just touched on Jay and let's get a look now at Army's defense brought to a spot chickfila who do you go with today Kenneth Brinson will be in the end of the line he's especially good against triple' option offenses because of his length and his ability to both play the quarterback in the pitch at the same time it's really tough to run towards him and run the triple option announced earlier this Allsworth they're not announced early this week was Brinson is a finalist for the camel trophy that is on the right tackle Scott haddock with 42 ticks of the clock remaining in the opening quarter clock running second and 12 now all just shy of the 40 yard line Sanders pitches was saucier as Jabari Bordeaux was waiting for him Air Force is really lucky that this ball wasn't a fumble Sassy's oval to hold on to it a good job setting the age of Boudreaux beats to the offensive players coming to try a block him excellent effort there 14 tackle the season for Bordeaux and just like that the first quarter is over fifty third alltime meeting between Army and Air Force and the Black Knights have a seven nothing lead thanks to a 21 play try to begin the game great to have you with us today you're watching college football CBS Sports Network start of the second quarter great to have you with us alongside my broadcast partner jay Feely Tina servo CEO my name has been all the time now to get a look at the day in the life of a cadet brought to you by today is military and isaiah sanders his father was a colonel in the Air Force and that's his daily routine we got up a little bit before that the other day but not normally but that's their day and it's a long one both of these academies have tremendous respect for what they do on the field what they do in the classroom and then certainly what they do when they're serving our country no question about it third and 16 now Falcons 37.7 on third down this season Sanders got time over the middle to the waiting hands there was McClinton he had a hand on it and couldn't reel it in so forth and sixteen and we're gonna see the punt team for air force here because they've got a third fourth and sixteen facing them at the 45 yard line he was looking for Marcus Bennett Bennett slipped on his break it almost was intercepted because of that Nick if he doesn't slip he's gonna have a play on that ball so here is Jake konkey on who kicks off does the placekicking and does the punting concluding the hattrick for the kicking position Reynolds back in the lineup this week and a good run back he got it out over the 25 yard line waters over there to make the stop on him came flying in for the backside army gets it back after a 36yard caught their second possession leading 7 nothing pretty much the second quarter 7nothing army on top and the game's big but the buildup all week as big as well Tina's got more on that oh it is then Thursday night here at West Point the Academy held a bonfire now army only does bonfires before the Air Force and Navy games the mechanical engineering Club builds either a ship or a jet to burn a top of the kindling and up in flames wet the Air Force jet with hundreds of cadets jumping and dancing all through the night now we saw the prisoner exchange before kickoff and the Air Force cadets according to a couple of football players told me they're Frank's we're driving the army players crazy all week they were taking chairs out of the mess hall they even spraypainted inside the Air Force Navy tunnel and in return Calvin Hopkins told me one army freshman took all the Air Force cadets personal items and threw them outside the Navy rivalry is huge and it is historic but there is a level of respect here there's some little extra edge though when army plays Air Force and there was quite a buzz this week on post yeah that's great stuff and I wouldn't try to roast a marshmallow around that fire with you yeah there is there's there's respect for both the rivalries but in this rivalry there's something different there's a different edge to it slump Cup right side not much there good job again that front for Air Force they're quick and very active they got to him in a hurry as he was stopped by Ross Connors well it kind of comes out right there at the end how did they got it back that's something these fullbacks have been really good at last year all the carries the fullbacks had zero fumbles on the year this year the very first time a fullback touched in Woolfolk fumbled against duke that was the first pummel they've had since then yeah wall protection is each and every year become better and better as Walker goes nowhere good work by Capra up front and that front very active brings up third down and long when I watched the Navy game and I watched what Air Force did defensively it looked eerily similar to me it looked just like what army did against Air Force so successfully last year in Colorado Springs and getting this shutout asked Brent days and Jay Bateman bolt about it what they saw as they were watching film and they said yeah it looked exactly like our defense you know the kind of Air Force took that scheme that was so successful for Army implemented and did a really good job against Navy you're seeing a lot of the same things here today army four or five on third down they need 11 Hopkins pressure come in the fighters it cannot connect incomplete and they can't convert pressure was applied by Jordan Jackson huge stop for air force after last Drive army at 120 yards on that drive 45 yards they had penalties of 15 yards to continue to back him up didn't matter now got the touchdown so to come out and to get a stop and to put a little fear in that army offense it's not going to be that easy to get the ball back for your offense that's huge Smith awaiting the punish reg he bobbled the ball he dropped one last week but he got it off and got a great punt he did fair catch called for by Andrews Smith the senior out of Gainesville Georgia Air Force has the football when we come back to Mikey Air Force down seven nothing they're getting the football for the second time once we resume play now though let's take a look at this week's where are they now brought to a spot Bass Pro Shops and Cabela's big combs army linebacker from Oh nine to 12 interception and a fumble recovery for a touchdown against the Air Force in 2012 he is currently an army captain serving in Fort Benning Georgia he was a fun guy got the norm a little bit that year and thank you for your service now they're in Fort Benning that was Army's last win until they went out the gas Springs of Pete Air Force last year Iraq we've talked about that with Jeff Monken he said does that change the mindset for your team coming into this game he said yeah we have a different confidence because we went out there beat him last year and shut him out he said in fact it's a little disconcerting to me yeah because I don't want us to be overconfident he said the biggest thing is we can't give up big plays they gave up a big play on the cash to saucier when Gibson lost him on the first drive but they were able to get a stop so here we go with Air Force and their second possession of the game Sanders hands off from behind Brinson dragging down Kaden Remsburg and a pickup of about four on first down that'll work for Air Force they'll take that all day long there's Brinson really late flag thrown in as they were getting up yeah found about the 33 yard line Kenneth Brinson mentioned earlier one of 13 finalists for the Campbell trophy the academic high up to the floor oh boy unsportsmanlike conduct defense number 19 the 15yard penalty automatic first down Donegal key fixture and Army's defense here it is Jake it was late late at the end of the play right now a change at the bottom screen Navajo gives them a little shot they gotta control their emotions army does they got a penalty on their first drive Holland did now not ago gets one Monken spit and fire down there and not a goal and Army's already got four penalties for 60 yards airforce just one for five yards and nautical trots back out of the field now he's probably happy in more ways than one to get away from his head coach he was getting after him pretty good but it's a game he should be well he should be fired up but he has to control himself yeah they all do you want to go out there you want to be physical you want to play to the whistle but you can't add anything in hurt your team four yard pickup by Sanders they're on first time he keeps it Christenson first one to meet him there and he stopped in his tracks they're gonna give him progress I'm gonna mark him down at the 47 yard line big third down coming up here inside of 12 minutes to play in the corridor air force pun intended going a little bit faster they can take a shot here if they want go for one on third down and Fagen got the football and they're gonna have to make a choice here they've gone for it as you said more than anyone on 30 times on fourth down they're gonna go for it here I don't have any doubt in my mind then again well the Bahaman is coming on and I don't understand this at all you know what army can do and how long they can keep the ball that had a form of 13 minutes on their first drive its fourth and twoyear across the 50 i disagree vehemently with this call yeah mom shocked about it too first first pot for he was 37 yards you're averaging four point three a rush on the year jockey hangs it up fair catch call for by Reynolds at the 11 and Reynolds makes it so Army's defense does the job against Troy Calvin's offense they got to punt it away again 34 yard or 7 nothing army like a postcard love coming here to my key stadium this game so far has army on top 7 nothing and next Saturday these two teams are right back at it here on CBS Sports Network we'll be back for army and Lafayette at noon Eastern if you followed by Air Force welcoming in the Lobos of New Mexico at 3:30 right here on the 24 hour Home of CBS Sports the commanderinchief's trophies break down Air Force is one the most they want 21 at two years ago Army has never that's what I was going to say in backtoback years in fat J entering this game today the first time since 1978 that army possessed I see and play air force here at Mikey Stadium so after air force decides to punt army starts at the 11 yard line and if this ends up in an 89 yard touchdown drive Troy Callen is gonna be kicking himself yeah as forth and he was across the 50 at the 45 yard line he decided to punt you can't give army you watched the Oklahoma game playing against athletes that are way better than army across the board down yet they continued to possess the ball for drives against Oklahoma of 16 plays or more you can get caught on the sidelines watching the paint dry well it happened last week in Army's win against Eastern Michigan Chris Creighton didn't go on side with a kick army got it chewed up almost the remaining seven minutes and change in the game and on top of it they scored a touchdown hop it's tough on their slithering his way to the 19 yard line it'll bring up a third and 2 for the Black Knights Devin Hopkins missed the game a couple of weeks ago and dinged is hip that he had surgery on earlier this year in the game against San Jose State getting a 5 on that play still not a hundred percent but he's close and back out there playing in this one see brent davis take a shot here what surprised me they've gone for it on fourth down all the way back tup around there 20 before armies four of six on third down hopkins following holland i believe he's got it based on the spot I'm seeing when Calvin Hopkins wasn't in the game against Miami at kam Thomas started at quarterback that's the play that brent davis didn't have the confidence to called right didn't do it until late in the third fourth quarter in that of that game even though he had a number of opportunities with Calvin Hopkins he's done such a good job with his offense protecting the ball the Brent Davis really has tremendous confidence way more than I thought he would have at this point in Calvin Hopkins his first season running this offense we watched Ahmad Bradshaw kind of develop into the quarterback that he became last year but that first year he made a lot of mistakes turn the ball over way too much fumbled way too much it's a Sunglass con today for Brent Davis you saw him there in the coaches booth backside pressure come in Hopkins took a heck of a shot and then he got a short pick up is grant Donaldson the sophomore came in and leveled him lucky to hold on to this ball this is the kind of ball security that he's talking about coming back across from the backside they didn't get a hand on the ball fair force can come across you know you're gonna get this hit and smash on that ball you can knock that ball out that's what not a goal did for army last week against Eastern Michigan when he came down with the tomahawk chop right on the ball yep donaldson a sophomore playing in his seventh game hopkins again that front again doing a good job pressure applied and linebacker Kyle Johnson coming in to clean up and finish up brings up third in about six for army much better on the last Drive and then this drive for the air force defense kind of settled down after army had their way the only thing that stopped army on that first drive was penalties three big penalties to back them up 45 yards but they scored a touchdown anyways yeah Air Force now has kind of found their way sometimes it takes a little bit of time to get comfortable to understand the feel of the game they've done a good job at this a big third down third and five they're calling it nearing the midway point of the second quarter pitch on the outside first down Ron army it's Jordan Asbury you picks it up line Kel Walker up outside he comes back in it cracks and then they run the option the other way good play design you fake to the fullback you get outside Hopkins gets hit hard here as an army quarterback you have to understand that you're gonna take a lot of beating you're gonna take hits you have to draw the defense in and pitch at the last moment and be tough enough to continue to take those hits time and time again that was Donaldson and lay the hit on here's Davidson just getting him from behind there was Connors or Davidson might still be running Calvin Hopkins took a shot against San Jose earlier in the year on a play like that hurt his hip that hip has kind of been bothering a little sore had surgery on it earlier this year as I mentioned and taking some shots in a game like this you know it's going to be even more intense than any other game you playing second and five now army Sandin McCoy the fullback Hopkins keeps it takes another shot Benja lime trying to strip that out and they think they did that was late there called it down yeah so indeed yes poulard progress you can tell how windy it is yes when he opens up his mic you can't necessarily see it as you're watching we can see when we look at the flags up above him ball came out they whistled him down so when they say forward progress stops and they blow the whistle yep that's the end of the play so Hopkins coming off on third down and four and can Thomas so now you don't have the opportunity to pass with Cam Thomas so expect a run here yes can't Thomas runs it and he's just sure he's a yard short of the first down does Monken dare here today they go for it I think even with Cam Thomas I think they're gonna trust their offense they didn't change their philosophy on fourth down against Miami right when cam Thomas was the quarterback it changed their play calling they didn't throw the ball near as much they didn't run as much triple option now cam Thomas did a good job and as he progressed in that game in the second half Brent Davis kind of opened up that offense Hopkins is back in the game I think they give it to wolf Fork here and Trust that offensive line and their bowl at fullback Darnell Wolfe Falk and in the ground gets the football st. Louis caught him inside of the 10 down to the six first and goal army of 52 yard run if you're Air Force you have to know that Wolfe book is going to get this ball watch the hole though as we roll this here get the offensive line creates look at that hole right there just excellent blocking and then we'll folk off with a huge game but as a defense you have to understand the situation Camp Thomas is in there he's not going to throw the ball they're not gonna run the triple option as much focus on the fullback get into it army pops him for a big one so Darnell wall fault now the 13th member in West Point foots football history to reach 2,000 yards after that run here's Hopkins now Hopkins finds the end zone Kelvin Hopkins takes it in and he completes the March 6 yard run army started this drive at the 11 yard line and they started this Drive after Troy cow who did hash so forth on 4th and 2 yup from the 45 yard line and it bites them in the butt army goes all the way down they lose their quarterback the backup comes in doesn't matter that's a disheartening Drive for air force no question about it Hopkins his eighth rushing touchdown of the season and he caps it off the march of 89 yards to the end zone with a 6 yard run Potter will hold abercrombie who's been great taken over the kicking spot and army with 403 of playing the 14 nothing fourth down conversion by wolf full get into the head 2nd level and plus in a big one the backup quarterback camp Thomas no problem putting it in the end zone they see holes where the hearts it's where a teen becomes a family we're tradition and superstition are one of the same is where greatness happened for the second year CBS Sports Network the home of army football CBS the Super Bowl season continues tomorrow regional action

at Nebraska and we wanted to honor legacy a legacy tradition so we started the Gerald our Ford award Gerald our Ford was the first one to receive that award and since obviously we named it after him and we wanted to give the Legacy Award to somebody who represents the best that we have to offer first that's a position of center but also the way they carry themselves when they're finished playing

student Bober and congrats to bob castle and great to see him he was awesome when he was the soup here we used to see him wild harley loving when he rode out revving that Harley boomer knows about running quarterbacks yeah that's for about 16 hundred yards in his pro career yeah so right now you got 403 until halftime here Jay Army's on top 14 nothing the time of possession 21:25 green to 436 air forces run just nine plays army has run 35 Sanders got time open target right at the stick and you're gonna be about a yard short caught by Lewis this is what I think they're gonna have to do to move this ball and be successful throw the ball through the air tough to do in this windy conditions nice little comeback 10 yards get second short yep a short yard indeed Sanders faked the handoff fullback and he'll pick it up but he was buckled backwards pretty good stick there by James nautical always aggressive from that linebacker spot Armed Forces football proudly supported today by Golden Corral number 92 add Reese Patterson came in there lay a pop as well I think it's gonna be tough running the ball army so good 97 yards rushing they're giving up a game that's eighth best in the country picked up three on that run to get the first down sanders has it sidestepped one wouldbe tackler Reilly waiting for him and he uses his link there to lean forward and pick up about six that was not a go who came in and had an opportunity to make the play he got the penalty earlier he's been so good for them when he's had issues it's being too aggressive and not breaking down at the moment of contact and running by play something that Jay Bateman has brought up to us that's what he did right there and Sanders is able to get a big game not ago last year ten tackles a tackle for loss and a sack against their forced and Army's 21 nothing win Sanders time over the middle pitch and catch first down Falcons inside of army territory Riley on the tackle and it was Jerrod Sanders with the first down catch standards a team Sanders the Sanders Saint play just want a little comeback army given them a big cushion and then not able to make the tackle picking up some extra yards Sanders is 12th catch of the season second on the squad Sanders puts his head down and gets about 6:00 on the run there J so they're they're effective so far in this drive they're moving the both desperately need an answer to what army has done so far going up 14 to nothing too huge long time consuming drives and this Air Force offense has to have an answer and I really believe you have to go for it here if you get to fourth down no question no question about it two punks all ready for the Falcons the last one really costs Army 189 Air Force going back to the air that's what they do well it's caught once again second catch on the drive by Brandon Lewis gain of 18 again the slot receiver that wasn't a comeback they went to the sidelines they're a good job by Sanders finding the weakness in army zone and exploiting it first and Tanner inside of the red zone Sanders lead Black Flag came in from the back check the penalty flag though with a minute fourteen to play in this half this one's gonna back their force up would be their second penalty of the game lengthy discussion here and they had a discussion like this earlier and then didn't call Bridal the unarmed II personal foul chop block offense number sixty shapes of sixty a 15yard penalty replay first down Laufenberg and Mitchell sixty six and sixty eight respectively they're guilty of what Army's done twice twice yeah exactly the same thing on the left side of the line right here coming up high low there's the chop and then the guard has a little bit I don't know about that one he didn't make cut he has to make contact he has to make contact here and then you're going whoa right if you're within one yard of the ball in the line of scrimmage you can come in and cut from the side I don't think that should have been called well its first in 25 now Sanders three for three on the drive throwing it and trying to make it four of four and he does now they picked up maybe a yard and it's caught by the tight end Cade Waguespack 62 junior out of Gonzales Louisiana the army had pressure time out here air force has two remaining with 53 seconds to play in the half just a oneyard gain on the pass it's a Cade Waguespack will step aside here at Mikey Stadium beautiful day and a good one here so far 54 seconds to play until halftime and once that's completed we'll get to our studio in New York coming up on the RAM halftime report powered by Ram trucks you can join Brent Stover Kevin Carter Christian Fourier and Bruce grant Kowski for stores highlights and a lot more around the country and they'll have firsthalf analysis of this game and a whole lot more coming up at the half first Stryker Brigade the combat team the 4th Infantry Division they're over in Afghanistan they're loving what they're seeing so far J and Calvin Hopkins had the second touchdown 6 yard run capping off that 89 yard drive and then little Sulley over there I like it so cool I love seeing these shots I did to honoring our men and women serving our country sure he's watching he played an Air Force he's serving our country in Alaska right now for the Air Force Nick feely appreciate admit that's thanks for your service two timeouts left for air force second at 23 now Sanders fans in got a man open Sanders make some key mistake as Reynolds came up with the interception huge turnover Sanders goes late down the middle Reynolds makes a play and army stuffs Air Force again 4,400 strong in the Corps and every army home game and that's our view of the Corps today brought to you by M Corps Mike Reynolds coming up with a bigtime interception as Air Force put together a solid job Jay his second int is interception of the year well it's starts Reynolds gets the interception but it starts with the pressure Watts West come on a little game that Bateman has here and push the pocket and they get contact with Sanders he's late going on the middle but the pocket collapses and you can see the ball just hang up in the wind and allow Reynold to come across and make an interception Reynolds practiced all week at a lower body injury a second pick of the year in amedeo West what a story he is basically missed the last two years with a couple of serious injuries Jay Bateman very proud of his comeback and loves the young man so 46 seconds remaining army from the four yard line Hopkins gives it off the Davidson nothing fancy coming here Jay they just want to get out of the half with a 14nothing lead like they did last year in this game Troy cow who knows with only two timeouts that he can't stop the clock yep here's isaiah sanders and i go back to that fourth and two decision by troy cal who was seven and nothing choosing even though you were across the 52 punt the ball you give it to army that get it out there 10 and they go 90 yards and score touchdown and go up 14 nothing and now you're in trouble huge huge turning point in this game or maybe we'll snap it one more time and they'll run off the field Hopkins who came out for one play chef monk ins guys monkids men 40 nothing that's the end of the first half Barba leads air force 53rd and some and I'm at 14 nothing you're watching college football on CBS Sports Network inching closer to the start of the second half here with our me on top of air force 14 nothing great to see you and be with you as always a pleasure and an honor to be here at Mikey's stadium with jay Feely my name is penhold and Tina sir Vasya will join us in a minute Jay a first half dominated again by Army for a second straight year against Air Force long sustained Drive moving down the field finishing it with touchdowns on fourth down it started here Woolfolk gets it gets into the secondlevel pit game sets army up even though Calvin Hopkins was out he comes back in and army kind of did whatever they wanted they had number of penalties that didn't stop them wolf walk out to the end zone of Hopkins gets into the end zone and then it finished on this the air force trying before they have to get back in it they get pressure Reynolds get the pick is 40 nothing it felt like it was a much bigger lead than that yeah that was the Reynolds Wrap to the first half I suppose time now for our numbers our first half stats brought to us by your exchanged I mean there's so much to pick from normally I ask you what grabs your eyes but I think everything probably does well time of possession certainly huge in favor of army look at the rushing yards 174 for army 33 for airforce I mean both these teams run the triple option and run the ball but Air Force not able to move the ball army doing what they wanted sustaining drives not turning it over if they eliminate penalties that was pretty much a perfect first half it certainly was army will kick it away and we'll see if the Falcons can do something with it saucier on the return and he gets out over the 20yard line does saucier let's get down to Tina servo CEO who had a chance to talk with both coaches Tina right bang well when I spoke to Jeff Monken he said of course he was so happy with that big turnover by the defense but he really wants to defense to close him more on the wide receivers he said Air Force is getting way too open we have to quote snug up on those routes something I've also observed on the sideline from Kelvin Hopkins he came in that hip is bothering him it continues to bother him I was told the kid is tough he's going to continue to go out there and play trick Calhoun says we just have to be more stout against the run yes and thank you Tina's DJ Hammond has started this second half and he comes out fire and Jay with a strike down to the 42 yard line of army a gain of 32 it was caught by Marcus Bennett see if it changes here with Hammond running the offense he's a soft part of Hampton Georgia found out the morning of the Navy game he was starting and he played very well in that game J he certainly did they only had 33 rushing yards in the first half here for stat5 reception 77 yards and Cullen slinging it that's where they've been able to to make plays is through the air here he goes again a low throw but reaching down to reel that catch in the third grab of the game for Brandon Lewis so what army did defensively well it wasn't pretty for Air Force on offense in the first half and made the decision on fourth and 2 to punt the back fired army drove the length of field sport a touchdown desperately need points here to get back in this game third and three now given name is Donald Hammond and he's under pressure and throws it away J Bateman brought the heat off the corners it's fourth and free was looking for Andrew Smith was Donald Hammond you have to go for it here fourth and three from the 35 you didn't do it in the first half sure that's something Troy Calhoun is kicking himself for dreading that decision yep numbers on Sanders there you saw four down conversions the most attempts in the FBS at 30 huge play for the Falcons 83 it rhymes for gets the first down he shoved out of bounds late flag they're really wily hit him yep there is a flag down and another one comes in as well it's a rivalry game an emotional intense game we've seen a little bit of emotion flow over in this one more so from Army a couple of undisciplined penalties in the first half you might see another cut block penalty here yeah against Air Force so one against Air Force in the first half three against army when our referee Mike Duffy he's thorough they've had a lot of conversations every time I have it's been the chop block step the combination highlow here's the verdict personal foul illegal block below the waist on the offense 15yard penalty replay throw down and let's look back here a penalty called on Troy Calhoun's offensive group J let's be a huge penalty tier let's look for you're looking for okay alright so what happens now you can't come from outside the tackle box back into the field of play and block low that's something army got called on earlier in the season I think it was a Sperry who did up they as a distinct rule you have to come out you can come back in and block yeah you got a block head up you got a block of blow the way she can't come in a block flow otherwise such a huge penalty air force gets the conversion on fourth down they're going on this drive that's just a mental mistake on air force and it forces a punt Jay cocky on the punt for the third time 36 yards and 34 in his first two punts of the day let's say bounce can Air Force save it they do it's an excellent job of course but Reynolds should have come up and fair caught that ball I think it may have crossed it did and it did in college football if the ball set that ball goes across the goal line it's a touchback airforce unable to down early stages of the second half army on top 14 nothing against airports what do you say we go back to 1988 in Philadelphia Army and Navy Ben Barnett open a scoring for Army with a 1 yard touchdown run after a Navy comeback attempt Brian McWilliams put army up for good in a 20 to 15 win for the Black Knights over the mids that day and only 35 days to go with a countdown to America's game the Army Navy game presented under further review by USA on CBS sports and you heard right there the referee there taking a look back at this play the play that Air Force thought and hoped they had down just before the goal on Jay so if this ball crosses the goal line at all it's a touchback it's not his feet and the NFL would be the body but it's the ball and you have that official standing right there watching exactly down the line and he called it a touch back so do you have any evidence to overturn his Col I don't believe so he's looking at it that's Terry Jones the back judge and it was Abraham knew no that thought he saved it and what led to that punt you had a fourth down conversion by air four and you get a penalty for an illegal blow block yellow block coming back inside a four decision a mental heir going low when you know that's illegal I can't come back in this and block blow the ways of you the ruling on the field stands touchback first down all right so it stands and it's a touchback and so instead we'll have it instead of having a first down around the 30yard line going in now you give our me the ball back to the 20yard line you get no points you don't get back in this game it's a tough sequence therefore air force yeah they're forced cheerleaders trying to get their group fired up there's Calvin Hopkins trotting back I came up for one play you mentioned it and half time there is cam came on it his backup spot cam Thomas came in and Hopkins came in scored a sixyard touchdown Hopkins left side good pursuit back Niles got him wrapped up and drops him and they're gonna give him the 21 yard line the first half possessions j4r me they worked out pretty well for Jeff Monken and Brent Davis in the offensive group well it looked a lot like last year it had the one punt they didn't punt the ball at all last year at Colorado Springs the two long drives 75 yards and 89 yards that 75 in our first drive was really 120 yards of offense because they had three penalties you know a lot of days I'll wake up and say by the end of the day I didn't think I'd see or hear or do that I didn't think I'd hear that or see it or say it Darnell Wolfe fault productive first half on to him it's it's not often Jay Woolfolk is not productive he is such a load to tackle an excellent first half 11 attempts 87 yards averaging seven point nine a rush and the touchdown that was helped by that 52 yard run on fourth down yep became the 13th player in army football history to hit 2000 rushing yards in his career on that long run you know you have to key on him you know that you have to stop him Air Force hasn't been unable to do that 12 carries for 90 yards and a touchdown for Wolfe folks so far today he gets the call again puts his head down it's gonna set up a fork down and looks like called a long one this one will be interesting you're at your own 29 yard line you have a 14nothing lead and there's Jeff Monken decide now I know the analytics would say yes you go for it yeah but but that's he hit he told us we asked him one time how many times did you go against the Analects the entire year last year once one time and they're gonna punt here so I would say that they're going against that I think it's the right decision yeah if you don't get it and Air Force gets a stop and you give them the ball back yeah the 30yard line going in now you've helped him really get back in this game now remember shrink mishandled the first punt right in the first half and dropped one last week against Eastern Michigan 47 on the first pot got time although fedja ylim got in there as Andrew Smith is back and lets it bounce and it'll be down just inside of the 30 yard line good 40yard punt by straight got it off the air force gets to stop that they need 42yard punt the Corps of Cadets loving that army on top 40 nothing Hawkins we wanted to send a special shout out from the 332nd Air Expeditionary wing from our deployed location in Southwest Asia go Air Force Army greetings from the 455th Air Expeditionary wing here at Bagram Airfield Afghanistan we want to send a special message out to the bolt brotherhood

been you look around on this stadium in fact yep they're loving the fact that their army West Point team is winning this game Air Force desperately needs to drive they had it down inside the 40 unable to convert because of penalties Hammond threw a strike up first on need a series hands it off here and army getting to the ball quickly although about a four yard pickup they're on first down on the run courtesy of Kaden Remsburg the sophomore and nautical involved in a tackle the air force averaging 255 yards a game they only have 43 yards rushing on the game today Armed Forces football is probably sponsored today by USAA second and six air force trying to find the ends open going to the slots when they've taken shots through the air Hammond nowhere to go good pursuit on the outside Jacob Covington comes up with a big play a loss of three tried to run the option didn't really put it in the belly of the fullback that did draw anybody in army wasn't fooled at all in J payments defense playing stout against the run you figure these teams know the triple option solo there know what you're going to do they see it every day in practice you got to have answers Air Force all three on third down and there's a flag it's gonna be on Air Force another costly penalty will start offense number 61 fiveyard penalty third down Scott haddock it's the second penalty of the day on him so now makes it a third and a lot longer than it was each team with four penalties Air Force for 440 Army for four sixty there's Bateman third and nineteen now Air Force looking for a bit of luck there's a rainbow that just came over the stadium it's beautiful right now in the reservoir across the street from us hamon bullet delivered and caught out to the 44yard line it's Jerrod Sanders with a catch first down Air Force every time they've thrown they go into the slot good strike by Sanders he's thrown two balls both really good throws yeah he struggled in warmups when he was throwing the ball I was down there watching both Sanders and Hammond both struggled in warmups gain of 17 pitch and catch Sanders 2 for 46 yards catching the football back to the air and that one bobbled and reeled in that one's pulled in by Marcus Bennett's so another first down Air Force doing what they do go into the air gaining a 13 their little urgency now from the Falcon offense Figg in the fullback and then keeps to the 40yard line last week against Boise State they had more passing yards and rushing yards that's an anomaly that doesn't happen very often with tripleoption office is 242 through the air 201 on the ground to move that you've seen it today they had trouble running the ball so they're gonna have to do it through the air but they've got good practice last week now that was isaiah sanders as quarterback go right now you've got Donald Hammond goes by DJ as well DJ put a pitch outside breaking a tackle is saucier and saucier he's got another first down the Falcons putting together to this point Jay their best looking Drive of this game and it started on third and long I have third in like 15 Hammond threw a strike they get the first down on third and long max Reagan was late to recognize and they came up and then missed that tackle so there's an injured army player down I'm an Army sideline play is halted with 737 to play here in the third quarter like jaylen McClinton down army of course doesn't put their names on the back they put them on the front like their uniforms that is McClinton interception earlier this year here at Mikey Stadium and a fixture in that secondary the last couple of years for J Bateman like the starting quarterback from Charlotte North Carolina is McClinton Kelvin Hopkins from there as well J Bateman they're coaching his guys up talked often about J Bateman and how well he has coached this team very aggressive defensive coordinator loves to bring pressure from all different people multiple fronts what's his famous line how he solves his problems so my problem with aggression I mean this is a team that is limiting opponents to 27% on 3rd down they've done a good job air force just got their first conversion of the game yeah that's six in the country only 97 yards rushing that's eight in the country first downs in this quarter Air Force has them all for nothing six plays 39 yards they play number seven toss to saucier army the great job second big plagues made in the game excellent job sideline to sideline by that defense Jay Batemans defense has speed the ability to get to the sideline and make that play pursuit they got after the ball no gain on the play I formation here for the Falcons Hammond got time going down the meadow was sniffing for a second as they were trying to go to Jerrod Sanders again that's whom Reynolds got the interception on at the end of the first half Hammond had a small window if he threw that ball little earlier and a little in front of his receiver that may have been a touchdown it was a hair late a little behind and Reynolds made the break on the ball game because it's back on the left shoulder of his receiver that allows Reynolds to get in there and break it up burdens an air force pressure coming get it to him Oh wide open tight end and Cade Waguespack that should have been a touchdown shut up they got exactly what they wanted third and 10 they get the tight end to come out and just come across and army does a poor job of recognizing coming across James Gibson runs out of there it probably should have been caught it was a little low if it's a good ball he walks into the end zone for a touchdown and now you have to go for it on fourth and 10 yeah from the 31 yard line they need of course the 21 for down pressure drop wait and complete you just said it I saw my problems with aggression Jeff Bateman should have that tattooed on the bond his back he brings pressure Hammond does not have time to set up they get the stop army keeping a shutout for the second year in a row call Christensen in there apply the pressure army gets it back leading by 14 college football on CBS Sports Network a sponsored by Navy Federal Credit Union proudly serving the Armed Forces veterans and their families for over 85 years insured by NCUA by Ram trucks built to serve and by the US Army find out at goarmy.com slash warriors beautiful absolutely beautiful shot the Bear Mountain bridge probably six eight miles away from here we come up here it's one of the first things we see and one of the first things we saw the last play was pressure from Col Christensen Jay he's right here in the middle and he's going to come and delay blitz and Hammond doesn't have time to get to his receiver Jake Bateman loves to do the delay blitz he's got the least amount of pressure and sacks from his defensive line in the country but that's not what he asked them to do I asked them to occupy blocks and then bring pressure from his linebacker and his secondary dialing up making them uncomfortable he told us like I want them to not do and not see what they practiced all week no there's Kell Walker right side and he picks the best times yeah in all the years we've done the X boy he has a great feel for the game that I always when to bring pressure to when to drop she really does I guess Hawaii on fourth down they're trying to get in the end zone to tie it at the end of the game he doesn't bring pressure he drops and the linebacker picks it off Christian told me that play right heck of a win among many here at West Point along the banks of the Hudson we've seen over all the years to do an army games gain at two on that run from Walker we're more than halfway through this third quarter Black Knights of army lead 14 nothing Hopkins took a couple of shots there as he came up just shy the 35 yard line daelin Sutton among those in there that laid some lumber on him third down coming up here for army third about six really big third down again for Air Force in this defense have to get a stop get this ball back for your offense you had two drives that you got all the way in the army territory and you came away with no points are me six of ten on third down that's very emotion he's going to get the rock they pursue it does the job wanna play hot standing work turned in there excellent job by linebacker Kyle Johnson watch 44 Parker Norman though come off the edge and create pressure right there at the beginning that's forced Hopkins to pitch the ball early so he wasn't able to get around the corner and then do the option play because he had to pitch it earlier just allows the defense to pursue and get to the ball and get a big stop so we see Nick straig on who in the previous two meetings between these two teams had not punted there was one punt the last two years coming in by JD it's a roll he's supposed to read it he's done a fake there but he's got to see pressure and get that ball off he doesn't see it holds on there too long and then because of the pressure shanks the ball and a huge turnover here for air force cuz that's really what it is now he can punt this ball at any moment he holds on to it waits waits oh my goodness he's gonna block it and now he gets it off it was Jeremy fedja ylim that almost got it 4:44 to go on the third just the five yard punt we're back after just like a postcard another beautiful West Point Saturday for 44 to go in the third quarter army up 14 nothing time now for our mercedesbenz player profile Kenneth Brinson this young man is just outstanding in every single facet of his life down to Tina 14 of time with more on Kenneth Brinson yes as a finalist for the Campbell Trophy he has a 3.9 GPA in chemical engineering he's beyond smart when I talked to Jay Payton about his intelligence translating onto the field he said you know what we do line up for instant in different positions last year against Navy he played free safeties so he gets moved around a lot and then there are different calls and he's able to recall all of them rumor has it Brinson helps tutor all of the freshmen especially when they're getting ready for their chemistry exams he understands it teaches it everybody is able to retain it in fact he even tutors the tutors here at academy well we got to start calling the chemists then he's only one of four players in the history army to start all four years of his career against therefore Chris Carnegie did it Larry Dixon did it and Ryan England did it air force for the football very short field this is their opportunity the best to get into the end zone they're starting the drive inside the 35 as Fagan takes it and he got it to the 30yard line tackled by Christensen and there's monk and all over Schrag and he's telling them look you have to understand what they're doing defensively and know when to get rid of the ball they give him the opportunity to roll that allows your coverage team to get down the field but he should've got that ball up much quicker only a 5 yard punt it's good to see them talking again but not not that way well at least they're talking then talk for two years right run there by Hammond well shred had been having a phenomenal year going into the game last week against Eastern he had he dropped the ball on the one that led to a short punt and then shape the next one so it's been a tough two games so it's third down again for Air Force then one of five they need for trying to get this ball into the end got it breaks through there top one there by cold fake in the junior on AB Donnell in Florida he picks it up J and they moved the sticks a gain of nine the first successful run by Fagan's kind of picking his way through there hit four rushes for only ten yards before that run put a big first down for airforce 14 467 and a touchdown last week and that lost the Boise State big conversion there swinging out now into his hands instead that his rims Bertram's Bergin drugs but still on his feet to use about four bodies that get him down leading the way it was James Gibby Gib s'en it's only Remsburg fifth catch on the year I watched them run that play in warmups a bunch they feel like they can get outside the front of Jay bateman's defense get it into play makers hands successful play their force Fagan again just shy of the 10 yard lines gonna bring up a third and short about a yard pick up a four clock under three minutes remaining in the third quarter just joining us army started the game all they did was go 21 plays 12:55 75 yards officially but 120 with all the penalties Air Force trying to convert here Fagin the workhorse on the drive making sure yeah I do to buy about a football maybe a really good job defensively upfront for army getting push on that defensive line and then the linebackers coming in and stuffing the fullback two minutes left in this game this fourth down is huge for Air Force straight looking on after that five yard punt Troy Calhoun hope and his team can convert on fourth and a yard they're all of one converting on fourth down can they do it here Hammond he gets away and he's got it he picks up the first down so Donald Hammond the third gets the job done Riley to stop but it was too late it's now first and goal Air Force it was really Hammond his second effort there he's coming down the line watch him spin back he doesn't have it Harmon gets good push right there and then the spin back inside no one there for army to stop it and a huge pickup for Air Force and they're getting that first down and keeping this drive alive there six first down in this quarter first and goal now and off Fagan trying to drag a defender over the end zone and it was not a goal that was on his back and he stopped him inside of the one bringing up second and goal they're going fast watch the quarterback sneak yep and he calls his own number and torpedoes his way in for the touchdown air force is on the board with 54 seconds to play in the corner their first touchdown in the last two meetings against army touchdown was set up by the poor punt by Nick Drake waiting too long it ended up only being a five yard punt game air force the ball deep in army territory converted a fourth down and then pushed it into the end zone and now we got a ball game Ben we do indeed six rushing touchdown of the season for Hammond konkey on to try to make it a seven point game and it's off the upright no good and eightpoint game J with 54 seconds left in the third huge miss there on the extra point instead of seven it's eight it started with Schrag in the five yard punt led to the touchdown huddled ham in the third comes in and leads them down the field their force is on the board point after off the upright and it's a eightpoint game here late stages of the third Jay taki hadn't missed an extra point all year that's his first one really had started with the snap to snap and the wind that's whipping that way that pulled the snap away from the holder and then he misses the extra point and that's big difference seven eight points yeah man the ball just blew off the tee the wind blowing out of the northwest just watching those flags from across our broadcast booth here in the third quarter air force with a hundred thirty yard six first towns army eight yards conky gets some help there and he drills this one a yards deep into the endzone you're gonna see that snack kind of bring him out he gets the holddown fine and he should have made that kick it's always hard when that snap brings you away from where you are if it's into your body it's much easier for the holder but it brings you away sometimes you missed the spot and you saw that kick hole left and hit the upright instead of seven points now it's eight now you got to get a touchdown and the twopoint conversion indeed Army's got it back trying to get something going here late in the third but just eight yards and a quarter they need to wake up cuz they're in a paddle now and they've gotta sleep for this third quarter no question about it Hopkins drops back throws fires catches made and a good pickup they're on first down on the reception made by Glenn Coates little quick hitch and that's why he asked for yeah you can see that 221 plays the opening got last five they've had 22 plays they had two really good drives in the first half and they've been slow to get going here in the second half that was a nice quick hitch to get him started and get him ahead in the sticks yep 9 on that pass now they go back to their bread and butter it's Darnell wall fault and Wolfe folks got the first down up to the almost to the 39 but 38 and a half yard line you and I asked Brent Davis a lot over the last couple of years why he didn't throw a little quick hitches like that yep they're just not one of my Bradshaw did well he did so many things well recordsetting career for mod Bradshaw but he didn't throw the ball well Calvin Lumpkin that's what he can do no problem Calvin Tompkins was a spread quarterback at high school now he has no problem stepping back throwing hitches and going deep told us last week he said I was just throwing the ball 25 times a game that is the end of the third quarter and armies on top in the fifty third alltime meeting between Army and Air Force Air Force trying to win the game and claim the CIC choke the army trying to win the game and retain it the fourth quarter when we come back the Mikey Stadium right here on CBS Sports Network some of the best moving pictures from the game today so far appreciate the folks in our tape room putting that together our line score army seven in the first seven in the second let 14nothing now 14 6 here to sold out Mikey Stadium as we begin the fourth quarter with jay Feely tina sarvasya all of our crew my name is ben holden great to have you with us here on a beautiful West Point Saturday CIC on the line affair force winds they get it back it would be their 21st all time if army wins they retain it they could win it outright if they were to beat Navy if they don't and they win this game they'd still retain it because it had last year but they want to win the thing outright yeah absolutely army was dominant in that first half time of possession we showed that coming back in the beginning the second half but their Air Force flipped the strip in the third quarter now nine minutes 35 seconds time of possession compared to our me five minutes 25 seconds they get a touchdown they mix this two extra point it's 14 6 and army knows they're in for a battle now I mean they had been rolling everything had gone their way they get the 5 yard punt the air force gets good field position that cash it in for their first touchdown first missed point after since October of 15 against the Colorado State and Rams Tonchi bang one off the pup right so Justin Tucker for the Baltimore Ravens missed his first extra point of his career at Sammy's since middle school middle discuss in the game you spot a look at this place one of the best of all time to do it that happens yep and it always seems to happen at the most inopportune toughens I watched Tina Gostkowski miss one day if C championship is his first miss in like ten years that ended up cost of the Patriots and some say kickings not important not this guy I'm well aware because I'm with you it is because most times a lot of times the game comes down to you guys booting the ball great to have you with us first play in the fourth quarter on the ground good job there by air force that front blowing them up Connors in there on Woolfolk and some help in there as well from Capra big number 95 Cody Gessler senior out of Katy Texas the air force much better they've struggled making adjustments at halftime they come out and played excellent in the third quarter defensively shut down this army rushing attack Jeff Monken in his career here at Army 24 and to when they lead after three all 11 with these seven yards of the pole therefore Air Force they're gonna make it tough on him Cal Walker with a football they're gonna need four yards on third down but this is certainly four down territory for monk ins men only six seven eleven on the day on third down two of two on fourth down continuing to do what they do best and that's just grind getting good field position have the sticks in their favor and convert either a third down or fourth down came into the game 90% leading the FBS Tatar me on fourth down conversion this is third and 4g everybody on Air Force's defense within seven yards of the ball with a beautiful piece of running pile Johnson is that a big day made the tackle but they move the chains after a gain of eight good read by Calvin Hawkins comes out and then just a little slip and it looked like it was gonna be a tackle for a loss right here nice move slips the tackle gets the first step on and Rory continues to drive this ball down the field trying to make a march here and get this score stretch down a little bit more than it is it's eight now Darnell Wolfe faults the pull back Walker in motion there wolf full patdown Burroughs his way for about to the last two weeks Army has told us knock cruise that wolf hook was a little banged up his hamstring and said hey we're gonna use other guys so all they've done since Eastern Michigan Woolfolk had 24 carries for a 89 yards let the team primary sent today he's got 15 carries for over a hundred yards he's not hurt he's a soldier that's right 16 for a hundred and three J and the touchdown slunk is in now there's lumpke the fullback Walker goes in motion Hopkins gonna keep it left side he's close to a first down it'll bring up third and a yard and a half for army excellent push by the left side of this offensive line a combo block a little legal cut block the army getting close to another first down and even up clock that's more important than anything indeed a gain of seven there from Kelvin Hopkins his first taste of this rivalry the bar me seven of 12 on third down nearly 54% this season converting Davidson's in behind Hopkins Davidson gets it and he gets the first out and does a tremendous job coming in and playing his role and doing his job and Darnell Wolfe full he's doing his job just fine certainly has all year long 600 over 650 yards rushing on the year got nine touchdowns such a staple for this offense just the payback died but everything they do is predicated on fullback success that opens everything else up and Woolfolk in the last two years has really become a force for them over 2000 career yards and 32 rushing touchdowns yes indeed and there's the measurement Davidson got it I wanted to say about Andy Davidson I know he touched on it in the first half but the to me he's one of those guys the ultimate teammate you touched on it how well of us are good of a season had a couple years ago Woolfolk stepped up slump has stepped up last year and he he slid down the depth chart but he's kept a great attitude they love his attitude and the way he goes in and just does what they asked him to do exactly what you would expect out of an army cadet being unselfish yep doing the dirty work playing on special teams continuing when your number is called to produce but being there for your teammate recruited as a linebacker first serie played as a linebacker 6 for 27 form today gets the rocket kid and there's a flag down at the at the 33 yard line seventh carry of the day for Davidson if it stands personal foul face mask defense number 99 15yard penalty will be added to the end of the run automatic first down so that's on big 99 most esse 15 uh he's listed at 315 he's really like about 330 right in the middle of your screen right there late you can see him grab ahold of Bryce Holland's facemask yeah he was getting doubleteamed he was just grabbing for anything trying to hold his ground in there and he got the facemask and that's a big penalty 15 yards for army brings it down to 20 55 yards and penalties against troy Calhoun's team so far today play clock under five Hopkins gets it away Davidson stays in takes a shot they're gonna give him a spot about the 19 yard line this Drive looks a lot like the first two touchdown drives in the first half for army nothing special continuing to pound the ball yeah run the ball get first downs third fourth down and turn that clock it started with a nice little quick hitch by Hopkins that got the drive going yep 9yard play they've run ten nine runs in a pass 56 yards almost six minutes 11th play of the drive coming up here won't fullback game behind Hopkins Hopkins the 16 yard line so third and midrange coming up about five maybe six they'll need to convert last year when army ran the ball so well against air force Ahmad Bradshaw had 265 yards most of that was in the split zone follow where he would fake it to his running back and then follow the running back or pull back right up the middle we have seen that one time here today it's not something they do a lot with Calvin Hopkins but it was a wrinkle that they added for that game against air force hadn't seen it and a ma Bradshaw ripped off a ton of yardage in that game today it's been really the triple option and Darnell Hopkins pursuit over there it was a really good play design by Brent Davis but Coates didn't have the speed to get to the corner it was there if that's Kel Walker he probably scores on a quarter fourth and three if you kicked a field goal here you know you're very aggressive on fourth down but you're sitting there at eight points it's still a one score game you go in and you kick a field goal and you go up 11 air force missed an extra point going this way the wind is blowing hard two armies left here they're going I'm surprised I'm not surprised with Jeff Monken but I'm surprised because I think that's what you should be kicked in the field I gotta take a timeout they were gonna run out of time army takes his first timeout of the half and who knows out of the time out J they may change their mind but it didn't appear that Abercrombie's five four five so it's a big decision you'd be sitting there looking at a 31yard field goal tough golf for Jeff Monken back here at Mikey Stadium a key fourth down coming up but first on our mind of the USF Bulls clash with Tulane that'll be followed by another American battles UConn takes on Tulsa and later number 23 Fresno State takes on UNLV at 10:30 only on CBS Sports Network and now feely time to look at the college football playoff well I know you got issues with this thing well Ohio State was losing at halftime in Nebraska they came back they're up two points but LSU whose big win is against Georgia and loss to Florida Notre Dame beat number five Michigan I don't know how Notre Dame undefeat is not a head allocute doesn't matter it'll work itself out Alabama LSU today on CBS that's gonna be a huge game big one tonight so here we go J 8:40 to go it is fourth and three and army now they're gonna kick it yep Abercrombie is coming on yep I think it's the right decision sometimes discretion is the better part of valor yes I know you want to go for it I know you want to pound it but you go up 11 here now the wind is hard to his left he needs to start this ball over here on the right Center 30 yard attempt Potter the hole Abercrombie puts it up and ever cromby six for six it's not pretty but some faith yards he doesn't eat bitch he can do it alone Abercrombie that is big drive for army driving down the field Abercrombie knocks it through stays perfect armies up 11 I'm not a checking in our chickfila fan cam and those that serve we thank you all for your service go to the walk on today and Air Force and Army and the exchange and the Corps cadets going nuts in our chickfila fan cam here today at Mikey Stadium Jeff well I've mentioned my brother Nick who serves in the airport I got a brother Tyler Fela you served in the Coast Guard at fair port I know him and all his boys are watching as well so thank you gentlemen yes in the Air Force cadets here as well and therefore set to get the football back Air Force won their first leg of the commanderinchief's trophy race 35 7 over Navy the Air Force has got to keep this ball in the air that's how they're gonna get back into this game Hammond is 5 for 9 for 71 yards the big 31 yard are there when they've moved the ball it's been through the air I got 25 rushing attempts 82 yards ball blows off the TV for salyers help them out with that 8:35 remaining in the game 11 point lead for Army trying to make it two straight against Air Force and you mentioned all the way back in the open Army has never won the CIC trophy two years in a row ever had it's shocking it's unbelievable they won the first they won it last year the first time since 96 Salyer sends it down there fair catch called forth the seven by Safi a let's go back down the Hudson to Brent Stover in the studio for an update guys Nebraska had a second half lead on Ohio State until JK Dobbins runs it in his second of the day a three yard touchdown and seconds to go out of state just sport again so now they lead 29 21 on the Huskers thanks so much Brent is that update a lot of big games going on today that one of them and I know you're gonna have your eyes on Michigan at Penn State when we're done if they eyes ears both phones Air Force back to work Hammond under pressure nobody open takes off running and he's taken down at the 31 yard lines where they'll spot him down he was stopped by Gibby gets in after a gain of seven good job at living there by him and because I thought he was going to get sacked he was able to wiggle his way out create something out of nothing there and get positive yardage and now they got second three Donald Hammond came in in the second half took over for Isaiah Sanders good run there nautical the tackle it was Joseph saucier the wrong they'll move the chains that's one of those plays that they put in this week that you haven't seen that you're hoping to hit a big hitter you know you haven't shown that look and you go with what looks like the triple option right and they hit a reverse back inside to the left it only gained about five yards 745 remaining there force trying to put together and then a drive and he missed there the intended target there was Jerrod Sanders second down upcoming today's first on line mean brought to you by Navy Federal Credit Union Sanders sat it down that's what he and Isaiah Sanders had hooked up a couple times on him and thought he was going to come inside on a post little confusion there from the backup quarterback the receiver second and ten the 36 Mammon's got a ton of room nearside he's going to run and get the first down and smartly for air forces cause gets out of bounds with 733 to go as they move the chain really good look here good blocking there and then Hammond just takes off a little quarterback draw an excellent job by air force taking advantage of the aggressiveness of that army defense gain of 11 Troy Calhoun the head coach 9 and 2 alltime against army this team with a victory today would claim the 21st commanderinchief's trophy the most of any of the three academies he missed their did Hammond on the first down pass an open target Amadeo Wes the pressure third time we've called Amadeo West's name he created that incomplete pass because if he doesn't come in and get pressure he's got to stay outside to keep contained but he pressures him and him and isn't able to set and deliver the ball because that receiver was wide open see the quarterback comparison Sanders started the game Hammond in the second half Hammonds thrown 471 gonna throw it again here could not connect again looking for saucier there third and 10 coming up a lot of confusion on this series here a couple of times that the quarterback and the receivers weren't on the same page Air Force two of seven third down the 810 yeah you don't have to get it all here you know you're gonna go for it on fourth down so if you get half of it that's okay Mammon stands in slings it out their way to high Reynolds on the cover it's all pass interference why are they yes and there was no reason you didn't need to push them the ball was high now armies yelling that it's uncatchable I'm looking down at the army bench there's the coaches they're all saying uncatchable now we're gonna have a little conversation here it wasn't on the initial route it posture affairs defense number 10 they were looking for was Jerrod Sanders just really no reason here it's not here it's what he makes his break see there's two grab and then the pull there that's not they called that's a good call yeah it is after seeing that it clearly is 75 yards in penalties today for army that's 25 above their average other way Fagan wide open 20 inside of the 15 and a beautiful play call there by Mike teasing the offensive coordinator Riley with a tackle fake the pitch right and then you sneak your foot back out you never see this with the army or Air Force the throw back to the fullback on the back side wide open caught army again the second time they've used Army's aggressiveness against them and come back to that weak side gain of 30 on the pass to Fagin again right up the gut he takes the ball to the 11 yard line wound me aurilla to go leading the charge the first one to him you're down 11 here so you need a touchdown a twopoint conversion in a field goal yes so it's not for down territory necessarily here because at some point you're going to need a field goal second and seven took a shot still work he's still not Donnie was on top of the army player there took the ball down to about the six yard line B third and two here yep ham in there with a little tap to the side of the helmet of prints in of respect Riley in there on the tackle as well gain of five third and two as you said Jay up top you got single coverage they in the man on top and the man at the bottom keeps it pitches saucier will walk it touchdown air force into the end zone again Joseph saucy a little soft on that one a six yard touchdown run and the Falcons have got it down to a fivepoint game Viet very creative drive there by Air Force continuing to keep our me offbalance cashed it in and now because they missed the extra point in the third quarter they have to go 42 second career rushing touchdown for saucier infusion my army was slow getting lined up Hammond he's gonna keep it then pitch it and they get it saucier gets it done he is an outstanding young talented player they've got a three point game with 527 to go in it hammock coming down the line getting the pitch they get the touchdown and then they put Brinson in a little tough situation a twoonone and they cash in the two pointer great one shape it up here the finish with 527 left threepoint lead for army let's go back to your extra points feely in the fancy suit well air force only 40% third and fourth the Army's at 62% so they haven't done that get the ball to Hopkins hands decent job of doing that we'll focus been the workhorse zero turnovers that's kept army where they want to be but they've been sleeping in the second half stop the fullback they've done a good job against Vega into the lowest part but they hit him for the victory they're very creative play I might see sin in the air force offense they have three plays that they took advantage of Army's aggressiveness hit big plays on each of them and kind of went deep in the playbook there and I thought we'd see some things in these games when you're so familiar with each other gonna see some things they're gonna bring out some plays if they've been waiting all year we certainly saw it on that drive we certainly did with Hammond running the show and army did on the drive before they the clay to Coates we haven't seen that but Kosar just to slow the play was there it worked now if it's somebody else if it's Kel Walker they get the first down they don't coach gets caught and they have to kick the field goal and Joseph saucier there was the star to finish that drive 6 yard touchdown and he made the play on the twopoint conversion to make it a threepoint game Marmee has their hands team in they don't have the return team e'en ready for an onside kick I don't expect air force here and onside if they're going to take a deep there's kaki sends it deep Walker drifting back Walker gonna bring it back trying to get around the edge sophomore decision backwards and he lost but five yards and took one of our audio folks on as well they're okay air force on that last Drive he just touched down here's some of the highlights well he missed a couple of passes but here was the big one Fagan a throwback very creative you don't see that throwing to the fullback very often all then they cashed it in the option one way for the touchdown the other way for the twopoint conversion Hammond and it's done the job coming in in the second half to give this air force team a spark and get them right back into the game it's a threepoint game now they need a stop now any of the defense that come up and get a stop bar me gets a few first downs they could put this game away army in this second half only 55 yards and four first downs and a pickup of a couple on the run by Darnell Woolfolk down to five minutes remaining in the game today's first online is brought to you by Navy Federal Credit Union second and eight Brent Dave is gonna have to throw the ball I believe at some point here on this Drive yeah I would agree to that behind the right spot find the right moment call the right play I'd like him to go to Cal Walker Walker in motion pets and walk you don't see that soft he stepped out of bounds but I believe he's got the first down yes he does very few times have we seen that with a boy not at all again another play Kel Walker goes to the left looks like it's gonna be a reverse look at the runner what's that right foot right there that we can't assign 30yard right here come to sell me the angle yeah it's right yet as I was out good call by the official Kel Walker like it was going to be a reverse now I'm a pitch to him and he brought Woolfolk back an option to him I love it in my four years doing this and I haven't seen that they haven't pitched a Woolfolk at all yeah again going deep into the PlayBook bringing out something that they haven't seen 18 carries for wall fault converts their hat down trying to plow ahead that front though for air force is going to keep him to just a oneyard gain inside of four minutes to go in the game now air force has all three of their timeouts at some point they're gonna have to decide do we use them air force is able to win they would win the commanderinchief's trophy you're down three been trying to get this ball back your kicker who has a long of 43 missed an extra point in the third quarter so you have to have time and be able to get that ball down there where you feel comfortable so your kicker can tie this game up but first your defense has a good stop are me if they're able to win this game they would routine the commanderinchief's trophy and air force again doing the job up front it's going to be third and relatively long time out taken troy Calhoun and his guys will talk it over as well monk and his guys that's the Fox takes its first time out of the half that's the spot I think that Brent Davis should have thrown the ball right there yeah there for stacking the line and off coverage on the receivers could have easily hit one of those hitches that they did well 1714 last year it was the Ahmad Bradshaw show he got sick early in the game lost his breakfast then he went for 265 yards an academy record for quarterbacks here at West Point Kel Walker had two touchdowns and army that day dominated to a 21 nothing win first time Air Force had been shut out at home since 1980 Air Force was sick of seen Ahmad Bradshaw this year a different story third and nine there's the pass you said they'd have to throw Hopkins in a double coverage Montero's flags a totally contact nothing as he was looking for j'tia Klein Lewis and coverage Klein had gotten behind the defense the ball is there here comes the contact right there now whether that ball was catchable or not that's the decision we certainly could have called it they didn't that air force gives the stop they do and now rags got to come on I doubt they'd roll him out here Oh my cousin is going to say listen just step back there and put them all he's punted about well throughout the year averaging over 40 yards upon its this one away didn't exactly what you said Jay Andrew Smith back on their attorney speedy and he takes it back to the 34 so with 302 left after a 42yard punt here force has the ball with two timeouts remaining the finish when we come back to my key stadium army on top by three college football on CBS Sports Network you sponsored by mercedesbenz the best or Nothing by and core build power service protect aim by American Greetings that your exchange 3:02 left in the game army on top five three let's get down to Tina for an update on the weather conditions down on the field Tina well down low on the field there's always been a breeze earlier when Army kicked the field goal it actually wasn't that bad but recently in the last minute in this last time out there have been some pretty strong gusts and they're going from north to south blow it hard into that south end zone guys all right Thank You Tina I got 24 miles an hour sustained gusts up to 40 right now it's what it says on the weather app so army a 10 game home win streak their last loss leading at halftime by 14 or more points November 5th 2011 against air force go figure here we go in the finish Hammond Zing's one and it's off the hands of the intended target there couldn't pull it in Marcus Bennett should have made a catch there yep good throw their last loss here at Mikey was two years ago against here yes November 5th of 16 a 31 12 win and they want the CIC that day yeah he knows he threw a good ball made the right decision and his receiver just dropped it 6 out of 14 is Hammond for 101 he's rushed 8 times for 30 yards second and 10 fires man open talk and Regan's there to greet him it was Jerrod Sanders with the grab first down Falcons really good protection Jake Bateman didn't bring a blitz Hammond was able to sit back there and wait for his receiver to give up get open and then throw a strike gain of 19 clock continues to tick away plenty of time for airforce they've got two timeouts I expected delay blitz here by Jay Payton changing the play yep Hammond hands it off to Fagan that pick up there on first down to the army 43 yard line he was stopped by max Regan we're gonna get to about two minutes here two timeouts up the 43 yard line you need to get to about the 22 feel comfortable with this wind blowing really across and into their face for air force second and six Hammond pressure got rid of it and close to the stick little short yeah was Joseph saucier from a yard show Regan again forced him out so third and short as you say Jay coming up certainly have to go for it if you don't get it yep regardless of where you are third and one out of the shotgun goes having is it off an army comes up with a play they get Remsburg coal Christensen leading the charge to Lhasa to perfect call by Jay Bateman brings a run blitz to the strong side and they run right into that play tackle for a loss and now here's the game here as the game fourth and three 90 seconds left you got a hurry I mean you still have to get this ball another 20 yards or so if you get this fourth down you can't use up all your time there they go on fourth and three Hammond with a ball heaven stop get it get there army comes up with a play Cole Christensen again swimming over on downs army with a three point lead with 70 seconds left my goodness we met with coalition sin he said that they were keen on Fagin at the fullback position there pitching the ball more I love this court he said we have to win this game there's no other alternatives now there's two timeouts left for air force here there's 110 yep so they get stops they get three stops a row they could get the ball back with you know maybe 10 15 seconds left on the play clock Christensen went on I love this line he gave us yesterday said this year we need to solidify our superiority he may have just done that but as you said Jay two timeouts for air force Calhoun calls one here Wolfe Falk with a run air force takes a second timeout of the half 30second us so three seconds to lapse from the clock and Jay bateman's defense coming up with that stop on that fourth and three just moments ago but here's a look at what they've done all day they've been doing what they have done all year which is play phenomenal defense only 118 yards rushing tripleoption offense they average 255 through the air Jay Bateman who I've said all along I believe he's one of the best defensive coordinators in the entire country when you talk to coaching staffs around a tree they validate that sure Jeff Monken has been lucky to keep him as long as he had he's had offers turn those offers down yep very happy here 2nd and 8th Air Force has one timeout left Hopkins with the rod puts his head into the chest of the defender and Calvin Hopkins to the 46 it was Kyle Johnson that took set helmet to the chest Air Force takes his third and final timeout of the half Daniels for game thought to 102 it'll be a oneminute timeout and Air Force on a timeout so if they run this play here they run it even if Air Force gets a stop right it's gonna be about 55 56 seconds left run it down 40 seconds that's gonna take it down to about 15 16 you punt the ball set about 10 12 seconds left Air Force and get the ball and try to do something now out on the field 9 and 2 in his career against army we have to remember this all started this comeback attempt by Air Force started with Nick Schrag holding on that ball too long Air Force getting pressure it caused a 5 yard punt though just because you know it are me sitting here in a very good position this game is not over for air force no it's not they got to try and get a stop they got to try and strip the ball do something to get this ball back for their offense with an opportunity to try kick a field on tie this game third down and four upcoming for army ball at the 46 yard line with 102 to go we all know Army's not going to throw this ball they're gonna run it now on the season only six fumbles only to lost five of those fumbles came in the first game against Duke so yep they've been very secure with this ball and expected to go to their fullback in the middle to Wolfe Oh yep third and four Woolfolk behind Hopkins Hopkins he's going to keep it a little short is about a yard a little more than a yard and the tackle was made in there by the big nose guard most sense of a feet up so air force gets to stop you're Jeff monk and let this go all the way down to one second and I'll call a timeout fourth and one about 17 seconds left on the stop here Hopkins you can clearly sees now unfortunately you and I have been in the situation watching a game that came down like this a few years ago Michigan Michigan State all Michigan had to do was really punt the ball we went with the rollout punt there yeah drop the ball Michigan State picked it up and ran it back don't roll out there right you line up in this situation you have your punter do a onestep punt you practice this all the time here army takes two seconds timeout of the half it'll be a 1 minute timeout if I go if I'm airforce I'd line 10 guys up at the line I have one returner I come after this ball and try and get a block put pressure on Nick's rag in the last two games he's dropped a punt yes he bobbled the first punt today got it off I had a good punt but then he held on to the ball too long here's his play right here he holds on to it too long a lot of pressure to come in and ends up being a 5 yard punt so Nick Schrag who's had a very very good year for Army has had two games where he's had a lot of mistakes and that's in the back of his mind he's got to be able to put those out of his mind focus on first catching the ball it's blowing 25 miles an hour here that can have an impact on the snap yep and they're catching that snap as well and then he's quickly got to get that ball off 17 seconds remain there is Schrag and seeing the field in 16 or 17 in terms of punting but he's seen in 20 today well sure eggs not out there it's not out there there's no way that boisterous all they're gonna do is try and draw backsides think call timeout yeah exactly don't snap this ball and they got the first down I can't believe wow you talk about guts well guts I don't know that it was smart either they got it but if you don't get that if anything happens you just gave airforce life oh my goodness gutsy call by Jeff Monken that is bigtime guts unbelievable I didn't think there's a favorite snap of that ball says I'm not scared gets it done Hopkins and company they were three up three on fourth down and the Black Knights win the game 17 to 14 there's a lot of emotion the word hatred was thrown around well you gotta have respect for each other get out of there this game has been an awesome game don't deface it by doing something stupid on either side yes you're on the same team that's right but what a football game an army with the wind they will retain the commanderinchief's trophy they can win it outright if they beat maybe in December and filling for the second time they would win it in a row if they're able to do that but they haven't lost here Mikey in two years it's been unstoppable some of the games Miami of Ohio went overtime they stopped him on the two point goes believable Jeff Monken and the call to go for it on fourth down I was just stunned I still am that he went for it because if you don't get it all of a sudden air force is one completion away from kicking a field goal and tying this game mocking showed a lot of trust in that offensive line and in Calvin Hopkins to get it and here's a look back J at that fourth in 117 seconds were on the clock Hopkins followed Holland the pile and then Jeff Monken bop dad's gonna be one heck of a picture in his office one day that is quite a sight at the end of the day army three for 304 down yep they lead the country conversion percentage and air force they will sing first the objective of these Academy games of course to sing second but we will have the airforce alma mater let's watch and listen the air force water how great a scene is that beautiful sight the airforce alma mater and this is what you want in these games you want to sing second and Army's going to sing second as they make their way down in front of the Corps cadets all 4,400 well about 125 on the football team but they're all there now the playing and the singing of the West Point alma mater let's know Jeff Monken you heard him there it's staying here and let's go maestro indeed it is there's Jeff with his father army wins it they retain the commanderinchief's trophy with a three point win over Air Force more to come when we come back to Mikey three point win for Army they retain the commanderinchief's trophy the head coach down on the field with Tina Thank You coach congratulations first question we begin with the final play why did you make the call to go for it on fourth down well I figured at that point if we couldn't go three feet with the ball he probably didn't deserve to win so we just had to out tough them on one play and I thought our guys could do it I know you want to outright win this CIC trophy by beating Navy but to retain it here at West Point by eating air feeding Air Force today what does that meet you oh it's just a big win for our program it's that CIC trophy is a source of pride for this entire Academy and in the United States Army it's nice to get step one taken care of Air Force started making a comeback here in the second half with that new quarterback what are some of the defensive adjustments your players out of me they did a really good job they were throwing the ball effectively we just happened in the first half too we just weren't getting around those throws and he was making them and and credit their defense they got some stops that they needed and I was always frustrated we had to block pun and had some things just really disappointing but you know happy that we found a way to win and that's really what matters coach thank you congratulate thanks a lot B Navy Thank You Tina and that's what's next for Jeff Monken in terms of these rivalries what a game once again our final score army 17 air force 14 for JP Lee Jinu sir Osceola makrooh my name has been told the hope you enjoyed it it's been a presentation of CBS Sports Network the 24 hour Home of CBS Sports let's now get you to rent Stover Kevin Carter and Christian Poirier for inside
